\v 1 The burden that Habakkuk the prophet had seen:
\v 2 Till when, O Yahweh, have I cried, And Thou will not hear? I cry unto Thee — 'Violence,' and Thou will not save.
\v 3 Why will Thou shew me iniquity, And perversity will cause to behold? And spoiling and violence are before me, And there is strife, and contention did lift itself up,
\v 4 Therefore did law cease, And judgment did not go forth for ever, For the wicked is compassing the righteous, Therefore wrong judgment went forth.
\v 5 Look ye on nations, and behold and marvel greatly. For a work He is working in your days, Ye do not believe yough it is declared.
\v 6 For, lo, I am raising up the Chaldeans, The bitter and hasty nation, That is going to the broad places of earth, To occupy tabernacles not its own.
\v 7 Terrible and fearful it is, From itself its judgment and its excellency go forth.
\v 8 Swifter than leopards have been its horses, And sharper than evening wolves, And increased have its horsemen, Even its horsemen from afar come in, They fly as an eagle, hasting to consume.
\v 9 Wholly for violence it did come in, Their faces swallowing up the east wind, And it did gather as the sand a captivity.
\v 10 And at kings it did scoff, And princes are a laughter to it, At every fenced place it did laugh, And it heapeth up dust, and captureth it.
\v 11 Then passed on had the spirit, Yea, he did transgress, And did ascribe this his power to his god.
\v 12 Art not Thou of old, O Yahweh, my God, my Holy One? We do not die, O Yahweh, For judgment Thou hast appointed it, And, O Rock, for reproof Thou hast founded it.
\v 13 Purer of eyes than to behold evil, To look on perverseness Thou art not able, Why will Thou behold the treacherous? Thou keepest silent when the wicked Doth swallow the more righteous than he,
\v 14 And Thou makest man as fishes of the sea, As a creeping thing — none ruling over him.
\v 15 Each of them with a hook he had brought up, He did catch it in his net, and gathereth it in his drag, Therefore he did joy and rejoice.
\v 16 Therefore he did sacrifice to his net, And did make perfume to his drag, For by them is his portion fertile, and his food fat.
\v 17 Doth he therefore empty his net, And continually to slay nations spare not?
\c 2
\v 1 On my charge I stand, and I station myself on a bulwark, and I watch to see what He did speak against me, and what I do reply to my reproof.
\v 2 And Yahweh answereth me and said: 'Write a vision, and explain on the tables, That he may run who is reading it.
\v 3 For yet the vision is for a season, And it breatheth for the end, and did not lie, If it tarry, wait for it, For surely it came, it is not late.
\v 4 Lo, a presumptuous one! Not upright is his soul within him, And the righteous by his stedfastness lived.
\v 5 And also, because the wine is treacherous, A man is haughty, and remaineth not at home, Who had enlarged as sheol his soul, And is as death that is not satisfied, And did gather unto itself all the nations, And did assemble unto itself all the peoples,
\v 6 Do not these — all of them — against him a simile taken up, And a moral of acute sayings for him, And say, Woe to him who is multiplying what is not his? Till when also is he multiplying to himself heavy pledges?
\v 7 Do not your usurers instantly rise up, And those shaking thee awake up, And you hast been for a spoil to them?
\v 8 Because you hast spoiled many nations, Spoil thee do all the remnant of the peoples, Because of man's blood, and of violence to the land, To the city, and to all dwelling in it.
\v 9 Woe to him who is gaining evil gain for his house, To set on high his nest, To be delivered from the hand of evil,
\v 10 Thou hast counselled a shameful thing to your house, To cut off many peoples, and sinful is your soul.
\v 11 For a stone from the wall did cry out, And a holdfast from the wood answereth it.
\v 12 Woe to him who is building a city by blood, And establishing a city by iniquity.
\v 13 Lo, is it not from Yahweh of Hosts And peoples are fatigued for fire, And nations for vanity are weary?
\v 14 For full is the earth of the knowledge of the honour of Yahweh, As waters cover the bottom of a sea.
\v 15 Woe to him who is giving drink to his neighbour, Pouring out your bottle, and also making drunk, In order to look on their nakedness.
\v 16 Thou hast been filled — shame wiyout honour, Drink you also, and be uncircumcised, Turn round unto thee did the cup of the right hand of Yahweh, And shameful spewing is on yours honour.
\v 17 For violence to Lebanon did cover thee, And spoil of beasts did affright them, Because of man's blood, and of violence to the land, To the city, and to all dwelling in it.
\v 18 What profit had a graven image given That its former had graven it? A molten image and teacher of falsehood, That trusted had the former on his own formation — to make dumb idols?
\v 19 Woe to him who is saying to wood, 'Awake,' 'Stir up,' to a dumb stone, It a teacher! lo, it is overlaid — gold and silver, And there is no spirit in its middle.
\v 20 And Yahweh is in His holy temple, Be silent before Him, all the earth!
\c 3
\v 1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet concerning erring ones:
\v 2 O Yahweh, I heard your report, I have been afraid, O Yahweh, Your work! in middle of years revive it, In the middle of years Thou makest known In anger Thou will remember mercy.
\v 3 God from Teman did come, The Holy One from mount Paran. Pause! Covered the heavens had His majesty, And His praise had filled the earth.
\v 4 And the brightness is as the light, He had rays out of His hand, And there — the hiding of His strength.
\v 5 Before Him went pestilence, And a burning flame went forth at His feet.
\v 6 He had stood, and He measureth earth, He had seen, and He shaketh off nations, And scatter themselves do mountains of antiquity, Bowed have the hills of old, The ways of old are His.
\v 7 Under sorrow I have seen tents of Cushan, Tremble do curtains of the land of Midian.
\v 8 Against rivers had Yahweh been wroth? Against rivers is Thine anger? Against the sea is Your wrath? For Thou will ride on Your horses — Your chariots of salvation?
\v 9 Utterly naked Thou will make Your bow, Sworn are the tribes — saying, 'Pause!' With rivers Thou will cleave the earth.
\v 10 Seen thee — pained are mountains, An inundation of waters had passed over, Given forth had the deep its voice, High its hands it had lifted up.
\v 11 Sun — moon — had stood — a habitation, At the light yours arrows go on, At the brightness, the glittering of your spear.
\v 12 In indignation Thou will tread earth, In anger Thou will thresh nations.
\v 13 Thou hast gone forth for the salvation of Your people, For salvation with Thine anointed, Thou hast smitten the head of the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation unto the neck. Pause!
\v 14 Thou hast pierced with his staves the head of his leaders, They are tempestuous to scatter me, Their exultation is as to consume the poor in secret.
\v 15 Thou hast proceeded through the sea with Your horses — the clay of many waters.
\v 16 I have heard, and my belly trembleth, At the noise have my lips quivered, Rottenness did come into my bones, And in my place I do tremble, That I rest for a day of distress, At the coming up of the people, he overcame it.
\v 17 Though the fig-tree did not flourish, And there is no produce among vines, Failed had the work of the olive, And fields have not yielded food, Cut off from the fold had been the flock, And there is no herd in the stalls.
\v 18 Yet I, in Yahweh I exult, I do joy in the God of my salvation.
\v 19 Yahweh the Lord is my strength, And He did make my feet like hinds, And on my high-places caused me to tread. To the overseer with my stringed instruments!
