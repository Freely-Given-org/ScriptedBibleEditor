\v 1 The Song of Songs, that is Solomon's.
\v 2 Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, For better are your loves than wine.
\v 3 For fragrance are your perfumes good. Perfume emptied out — your name, Therefore have virgins loved you!
\v 4 Draw me: after you we run, The king had brought me into his inner chambers, We do joy and rejoice in you, We mention your loves more than wine, Uprightly they have loved you!
\v 5 Dark am I, and comely, daughters of Jerusalem, As tents of Kedar, as curtains of Solomon.
\v 6 Fear me not, because I am very dark, Because the sun had scorched me, The sons of my mother were angry with me, They made me keeper of the vineyards, My vineyard — my own — I have not kept.
\v 7 Declare to me, you whom my soul had loved, Where you delightest, Where you liest down at noon, For why am I as one veiled, By the ranks of your companions?
\v 8 If you knowest not, O fair among women, Get you forth by the traces of the flock, And feed your kids by the shepherds' dwellings!
\v 9 To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh, I have compared you, my friend,
\v 10 Comely have been your cheeks with garlands, Your neck with chains.
\v 11 Garlands of gold we do make for you, With studs of silver!
\v 12 While the king is in his circle, My spikenard had given its fragrance.
\v 13 A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, Between my breasts it lodgeth.
\v 14 A cluster of cypress is my beloved to me, In the vineyards of En-Gedi!
\v 15 Lo, you are fair, my friend, Lo, you are fair, yours eyes are doves!
\v 16 Lo, you are fair, my love, yea, pleasant, Yea, our couch is green,
\v 17 The beams of our houses are cedars, Our rafters are firs, I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys!
\c 2
\v 1 As a lily among the thorns,
\v 2 So is my friend among the daughters!
\v 3 As a citron among trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons, In his shade I delighted, and sat down, And his fruit is sweet to my palate.
\v 4 He had brought me in unto a house of wine, And his banner over me is love,
\v 5 Sustain me with grape-cakes, Support me with citrons, for I am sick with love.
\v 6 His left hand is under my head, And his right did embrace me.
\v 7 I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!
\v 8 The voice of my beloved! behold, this — he is coming, Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.
\v 9 My beloved is like to a roe, Or to a young one of the harts. Lo, this — he is standing behind our wall, Looking from the windows, Blooming from the lattice.
\v 10 My beloved had answered and said to me, 'Rise up, my friend, my fair one, and come away,
\v 11 For behold, the winter had passed by, The rain had passed away — it had gone.
\v 12 The flowers have appeared in the earth, The time of the singing had come, And the voice of the turtle was heard in our land,
\v 13 The fig-tree had ripened her green figs, And the sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, Rise, come, my friend, my fair one, yea, come away.
\v 14 My dove, in clefts of the rock, In a secret place of the ascent, Cause me to see yours appearance, Cause me to hear your voice, For your voice is sweet, and your appearance comely.
\v 15 Seize you for us foxes, Little foxes — destroyers of vineyards, Even our sweet-smelling vineyards.
\v 16 My beloved is mine, and I am his, Who is delighting among the lilies,
\v 17 Till the day did break forth, And the shadows have fled away, Turn, be like, my beloved, To a roe, or to a young one of the harts, On the mountains of separation!
\c 3
\v 1 On my couch by night, I sought him whom my soul had loved; I sought him, and I found him not!
\v 2  — Pray, let me rise, and go round the city, In the streets and in the broad places, I seek him whom my soul had loved! — I sought him, and I found him not.
\v 3 The watchmen have found me, (Who are going round about the city), 'Him whom my soul have loved saw you?'
\v 4 But a little I passed on from them, Till I found him whom my soul had loved! I seized him, and let him not go, Till I brought him in unto the house of my mother — And the chamber of her that conceived me.
\v 5 I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!
\v 6 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, Like palm-trees of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, From every powder of the merchant?
\v 7 Lo, his couch, that is Solomon's, Sixty mighty ones are around it, Of the mighty of Israel,
\v 8 All of them holding sword, taught of battle, Each his sword by his thigh, for fear at night.
\v 9 A palanquin king Solomon made for himself, Of the wood of Lebanon,
\v 10 Its pillars he made of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, Its middle lined with love, By the daughters of Jerusalem.
\v 11 Go forth, and look, you daughters of Zion, On king Solomon, with the crown, With which his mother crowned him, In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the joy of his heart!
\c 4
\v 1 Lo, you are fair, my friend, behold, you are fair, Thine eyes are doves behind your veil, Your hair as a row of the goats That have shone from mount Gilead,
\v 2 Your teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.
\v 3 As a thread of scarlet are your lips, And your speech is comely, As the work of the pomegranate is your temple behind your veil,
\v 4 As the tower of David is your neck, built for an armoury, The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the mighty.
\v 5 Your two breasts are as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies.
\v 6 Till the day did break forth, And the shadows have fled away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh, And unto the hill of frankincense.
\v 7 You are all fair, my friend, And a blemish there is not in you. Come from Lebanon, O spouse,
\v 8 Come from Lebanon, come you in. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Shenir and Hermon, From the habitations of lions, From the mountains of leopards.
\v 9 You hast emboldened me, my sister-spouse, Emboldened me with one of yours eyes, With one chain of your neck.
\v 10 How wonderful have been your loves, my sister-spouse, How much better have been your loves than wine, And the fragrance of your perfumes than all spices.
\v 11 Your lips drop honey, O spouse, Honey and milk are under your tongue, And the fragrance of your garments Is as the fragrance of Lebanon.
\v 12 A garden shut up is my sister-spouse, A spring shut up — a fountain sealed.
\v 13 Your shoots a paradise of pomegranates, With precious fruits,
\v 14 Cypresses with nard — nard and saffron, Cane and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices.
\v 15 A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, And flowings from Lebanon!
\v 16 Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, Cause my garden to breathe forth, its spices let flow, Let my beloved come to his garden, And eat its pleasant fruits!
\c 5
\v 1 I have come in to my garden, my sister-spouse, I have plucked my myrrh with my spice, I have eaten my comb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, drink, Yea, drink abundantly, O beloved ones!
\v 2 I am sleeping, but my heart waketh: The sound of my beloved knocking! 'Open to me, my sister, my friend, My dove, my perfect one, For my head is filled with dew, My locks with drops of the night.'
\v 3 I have put off my coat, how do I put it on? I have washed my feet, how do I defile them?
\v 4 My beloved sent his hand from the net-work, And my bowels were moved for him.
\v 5 I rose to open to my beloved, And my hands dropped myrrh, Yea, my fingers flowing myrrh, On the handles of the lock.
\v 6 I opened to my beloved, But my beloved withdrew — he passed on, My soul went forth when he spake, I sought him, and found him not. I called him, and he answered me not.
\v 7 The watchmen who go round about the city, Found me, smote me, wounded me, Keepers of the walls lifted up my veil from off me.
\v 8 I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved — What do you tell him? that I am sick with love!
\v 9 What is your beloved above any beloved, O fair among women? What is your beloved above any beloved, That thus you hast adjured us?
\v 10 My beloved is clear and ruddy, Conspicuous above a myriad!
\v 11 His head is pure gold — fine gold, His locks flowing, dark as a raven,
\v 12 His eyes as doves by streams of water, Washing in milk, sitting in fulness.
\v 13 His cheeks as a bed of the spice, towers of perfumes, His lips are lilies, dropping flowing myrrh,
\v 14 His hands rings of gold, set with beryl, His heart bright ivory, covered with sapphires,
\v 15 His limbs pillars of marble, Founded on sockets of fine gold, His appearance as Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
\v 16 His mouth is sweetness — and all of him desirable, This is my beloved, and this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem!
\c 6
\v 1 Whither had your beloved gone, O fair among women? Whither had your beloved turned, And we seek him with you?
\v 2 My beloved went down to his garden, To the beds of the spice, To delight himself in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
\v 3 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine, Who is delighting himself among the lilies.
\v 4 Fair are you, my friend, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts.
\v 5 Turn round yours eyes from before me, Because they have made me proud. Your hair is as a row of the goats, That have shone from Gilead,
\v 6 Your teeth as a row of the lambs, That have come up from the washing, Because all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.
\v 7 As the work of the pomegranate is your temple behind your veil.
\v 8 Sixty are queens, and eighty concubines, And virgins without number.
\v 9 One is my dove, my perfect one, One she is of her mother, The choice one she is of her that bare her, Daughters saw, and pronounce her happy, Queens and concubines, and they praise her.
\v 10 Who is this that is looking forth as morning, Fair as the moon — clear as the sun, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?'
\v 11 Unto a garden of nuts I went down, To look on the buds of the valley, To see where the vine had flourished, The pomegranates had blossomed — 
\v 12 I knew not my soul, It made me — chariots of my people Nadib.
\v 13 Return, return, O Shulammith! Return, return, and we look upon you. What do you see in Shulammith?
\c 7
\v 1 As the chorus of 'Mahanaim.' How beautiful were your feet with sandals, O daughter of Nadib. The turnings of your sides are as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer.
\v 2 Your waist is a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the mixture, Your body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies,
\v 3 Your two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,
\v 4 Your neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Your face as a tower of Lebanon looking to Damascus,
\v 5 Your head upon you as Carmel, And the locks of your head as purple, The king is bound with the flowings!
\v 6 How fair and how pleasant hast you been, O love, in delights.
\v 7 This your stature had been like to a palm, And your breasts to clusters.
\v 8 I said, 'Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its boughs, Yea, let your breasts be, I pray you, as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your face as citrons,
\v 9 And your palate as the good wine — 'Flowing to my beloved in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!
\v 10 I am my beloved's, and on me is his desire.
\v 11 Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,
\v 12 We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We see if the vine had flourished, The sweet smelling-flower had opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to you my loves;
\v 13 The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for you!
\c 8
\v 1 Who did make you as a brother to me, Sucking the breasts of my mother? I find you without, I kiss you, Yea, they do not despise me,
\v 2 I lead you, I bring you in unto my mother's house, She did teach me, I cause you to drink of the perfumed wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate,
\v 3 His left hand is under my head, And his right did embrace me.
\v 4 I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, How you stir up, And how you wake the love till she please!
\v 5 Who is this coming from the wilderness, Hasting herself for her beloved? Under the citron-tree I have waked you, There did your mother pledge you, There she gave a pledge that bare you.
\v 6 Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on yours arm, For strong as death is love, Sharp as Sheol is jealousy, Its burnings are burnings of fire, a flame of Jah!
\v 7 Many waters are not able to quench the love, And floods do not wash it away. If one give all the wealth of his house for love, Treading down — they tread upon it.
\v 8 We have a little sister, and breasts she had not, What do we do for our sister, In the day that it is told of her?
\v 9 If she is a wall, we build by her a palace of silver. And if she is a door, We fashion by her board-work of cedar.
\v 10 I am a wall, and my breasts as towers, Then I have been in his eyes as one finding peace.
\v 11 Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-Hamon, He had given the vineyard to keepers, Each brought for its fruit a thousand silverlings;
\v 12 My vineyard — my own — is before me, The thousand is for you, O Solomon. And the two hundred for those keeping its fruit. O dweller in gardens!
\v 13 The companions are attending to your voice, Cause me to hear. Flee, my beloved, and be like to a roe,
\v 14 Or to a young one of the harts on mountains of spices!
