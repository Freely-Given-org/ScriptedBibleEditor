\v 1 And it came to pass, in the days of the judging of the judges, that there is a famine in the land, and there went a man from Beth-Lehem-Judah to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
\v 2 And the name of the man is Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Beth-Lehem-Judah; and they come into the fields of Moab, and are there.
\v 3 And Elimelech husband of Naomi dieth, and she is left, she and her two sons;
\v 4 and they take to them wives, Moabitesses: the name of the one is Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwell there about ten years.
\v 5 And they die also, both of them — Mahlon and Chilion — and the woman is left of her two children and of her husband.
\v 6 And she riseth, she and her daughters-in-law, and turneth back from the fields of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that God had looked after His people, — to give to them bread.
\v 7 And she went out from the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they go in the way to turn back unto the land of Judah.
\v 8 And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, 'Go, turn back, each to the house of her mother; Yahweh did with you kindness as ye have done with the dead, and with me;
\v 9 Yahweh did grant to you, and find ye rest each in the house of her husband;' and she kisseth them, and they lift up their voice and weep.
\v 10 And they say to her, 'Surely with thee we go back to your people.'
\v 11 And Naomi said, 'Turn back, my daughters; why do ye go with me? are there yet to me sons in my bowels that they have been to you for husbands?
\v 12 Turn back, my daughters, go, for I am too aged to be to a husband; yough I had said, There is for me hope, also, I have been to-night to a husband, and also I have borne sons:
\v 13 for them do ye wait till that they grow up? for them do ye shut yourselves up, not to be to a husband? nay, my daughters, for more bitter to me than to you, for the hand of Yahweh had gone out against me.'
\v 14 And they lift up their voice, and weep again, and Orpah kisseth her mother-in-law, and Ruth had cleaved to her.
\v 15 And she said, 'Lo, your sister-in-law had turned back unto her people, and unto her god, turn you back after your sister-in-law.'
\v 16 And Ruth said, 'Urge me not to leave thee — to turn back from after thee; for whither you goest I go, and where you lodgest I lodge; your people is my people, and your God my God.
\v 17 Where you diest I die, and there I am buried; thus did Yahweh to me, and thus did He add — for death itself did part between me and thee.'
\v 18 And she saw that she is strengthening herself to go with her, and she ceaseth to speak unto her;
\v 19 and they go both of them till their coming in to Beth-Lehem; and it came to pass at their coming in to Beth-Lehem, that all the city is moved at them, and they say, 'Is this Naomi?'
\v 20 And she said unto them, 'Call me not Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty had dealt very bitterly to me,
\v 21 I went out full, and empty had Yahweh brought me back, why do ye call me Naomi, and Yahweh had testified against me, and the Almighty had done evil to me?'
\v 22 And Naomi turneth back, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who had turned back from the fields of Moab, and they have come in to Beth-Lehem at the commencement of barley-harvest.
\c 2
\v 1 And Naomi had an acquaintance of her husband's, a man mighty in wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name is Boaz.
\v 2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, 'Let me go, I pray thee, into the field, and I gather among the ears of corn after him in whose eyes I find grace;' and she said to her, 'Go, my daughter.'
\v 3 And she went and came and gathereth in a field after the reapers, and her chance happeneth — the portion of the field is Boaz's who is of the family of Elimelech.
\v 4 And lo, Boaz had come from Beth-Lehem, and said to the reapers, 'Yahweh is with you;' and they say to him, 'Yahweh did bless thee.'
\v 5 And Boaz said to his young man who is set over the reapers, 'Whose is this young person?'
\v 6 And the young man who is set over the reapers answereth and said, 'A young woman — Moabitess — she is, who came back with Naomi from the fields of Moab,
\v 7 and she said, Let me glean, I pray thee — and I have gathered among the sheaves after the reapers; and she came and remaineth since the morning and till now; she sat in the house a little.
\v 8 And Boaz said unto Ruth, 'Hast you not heard, my daughter? go not to glean in another field, and also, pass not over from this, and thus you will cleave to my young women:
\v 9 yours eyes are on the field which they reap, and you hast gone after them; have not I charged the young men not to touch thee? when you art athirst then you hast gone unto the vessels, and hast drunk from that which the young men draw.'
\v 10 And she falleth on her face, and boweth herself to the earth, and said unto him, 'Wherefore have I found grace in yours eyes, to discern me, and I a stranger?'
\v 11 And Boaz answereth and said to her, 'It had thoroughly been declared to me all that you hast done with your mother-in-law, after the death of your husband, and you will leave your father, and your mother, and the land of your birth, and will come in unto a people which you hast not known heretofore.
\v 12 Yahweh did recompense your work, and your reward is complete from Yahweh, God of Israel, under whose wings you hast come to take refuge.'
\v 13 And she said, 'Let me find grace in yours eyes, my lord, because you hast comforted me, and because you hast spoken unto the heart of your maid-servant, and I — I am not as one of your maid-servants.'
\v 14 And Boaz said to her, 'At meal-time come nigh hither, and you hast eaten of the bread, and dipped your morsel in the vinegar.' And she sitteth at the side of the reapers, and he reacheth to her roasted corn, and she eateth, and is satisfied, and leaveth.
\v 15 And she riseth to glean, and Boaz chargeth his young men, saying, 'Even between the sheaves she did glean, and ye do not cause her to blush;
\v 16 and also ye do surely cast to her of the handfuls — and have left, and she had gleaned, and ye do not push against her.'
\v 17 And she gleaneth in the field till the evening, and beateth out that which she had gleaned, and it is about an ephah of barley;
\v 18 and she taketh it up, and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw that which she had gleaned, and she brought out and gave to her that which she left from her satiety.
\v 19 And her mother-in-law said to her, 'Where hast you gleaned to-day? and where hast you wrought? may he who is discerning thee be blessed.' And she declareth to her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, 'The name of the man with whom I have wrought to-day is Boaz.'
\v 20 And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, 'Blessed is he of Yahweh who had not forsaken His kindness with the living and with the dead;' and Naomi said to her, 'The man is a relation of ours; he is of our redeemers.'
\v 21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, 'Also he surely said unto me, Near the young people whom I have you will cleave till they have completed the whole of the harvest which I have.'
\v 22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, 'Good, my daughter, that you goest out with his young women, and they come not against thee in another field.'
\v 23 And she cleaveth to the young women of Boaz to glean, till the completion of the barley-harvest, and of the wheat-harvest, and she dwelleth with her mother-in-law.
\c 3
\v 1 And Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, 'My daughter, do not I seek for thee rest, that it may be well with thee?
\v 2 and now, is not Boaz of our acquaintance, with whose young women you hast been? lo, he is winnowing the threshing-floor of barley to-night,
\v 3 and you hast bathed, and anointed yourself, and put your garments upon thee, and gone down to the threshing-floor; let not yourself be known to the man till he complete to eat and to drink;
\v 4 and it came to pass when he lieth down, that you hast known the place where he lieth down, and hast gone in, and uncovered his feet, and lain down, — and he did declare to thee that which you will do.'
\v 5 And she said unto her, 'All that you sayest — I do.'
\v 6 And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law commanded her
\v 7 And Boaz eateth and drinketh, and his heart is glad; and he went in to lie down at the end of the heap; and she came in gently, and uncovereth his feet, and lieth down.
\v 8 And it came to pass, at the middle of the night, that the man trembleth, and turneth himself, and lo, a woman is lying at his feet.
\v 9 And he said, 'Who art you?' and she said, 'I am Ruth your handmaid, and you hast spread your skirt over your handmaid, for you art a redeemer.'
\v 10 And he said, 'Blessed art you of Yahweh, my daughter; you hast dealt more kindly at the latter end than at the beginning — not to go after the young men, either poor or rich.
\v 11 And now, my daughter, fear not, all that you sayest I do to thee, for all the gate of my people did know that you art a virtuous woman.
\v 12 And now, surely, true, that I am a redeemer, but also there is a redeemer nearer than I.
\v 13 Lodge to night, and it had been in the morning, if he did redeem thee, well: he redeemeth; and if he delight not to redeem thee, then I have redeemed thee — I; Yahweh lived! lie down till the morning.'
\v 14 And she lieth down at his feet till the morning, and riseth before one did discern another; and he said, 'Let it not be known that the woman had come into the floor.'
\v 15 And he said, 'Give the covering which is on thee, and keep hold on it;' and she keepeth hold on it, and he measureth six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went into the city.
\v 16 And she came in unto her mother-in-law, and she said, 'Who art you, my daughter?' and she declareth to her all that the man had done to her.
\v 17 And she said, 'These six measures of barley he had given to me, for he said, Thou will not go in empty unto your mother-in-law.'
\v 18 And she said, 'Sit still, my daughter, till you will know how the matter falleth, for the man did not rest except he had completed the matter to-day.'
\c 4
\v 1 And Boaz had gone up to the gate, and sitteth there, and lo, the redeemer is passing by of whom Boaz had spoken, and he said, 'Turn aside, sit down here, such a one, such a one;' and he turneth aside and sitteth down.
\v 2 And he taketh ten men of the elders of the city, and said, 'Sit down here;' and they sit down.
\v 3 And he said to the redeemer, 'A portion of the field which is to our brother, to Elimelech, had Naomi sold, who had come back from the fields of Moab;
\v 4 and I said, I uncover yours ear, saying, Buy before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people; if you will redeem — redeem, and if none did redeem — declare to me, and I know, for there is none save thee to redeem, and I after thee.' And he said, I redeem it.'
\v 5 And Boaz said, 'In the day of your buying the field from the hand of Naomi, then from Ruth the Moabitess, wife of the dead, you hast bought it, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance.'
\v 6 And the redeemer said, 'I am not able to redeem it for myself, lest I destroy mine inheritance; redeem for yourself — you — my right of redemption, for I am not able to redeem.'
\v 7 And this is formerly in Israel for redemption and for changing, to establish anything: a man had drawn off his sandal, and given it to his neighbour, and this is the testimony in Israel.
\v 8 And the redeemer said to Boaz, 'Buy it for yourself,' and draweth off his sandal.
\v 9 And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, 'Witnesses are ye to-day that I have bought all that is to Elimelech, and all that is to Chilion and Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi;
\v 10 and also Ruth the Moabitess, wife of Mahlon, I have bought to myself for a wife, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance; and the name of the dead is not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; witnesses ye are to-day.'
\v 11 And all the people who are in the gate say — also the elders — 'Witnesses! Yahweh make the woman who is coming in unto your house as Rachel and as Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and do you virtuously in Ephrathah, and proclaim the Name in Beth-Lehem;
\v 12 and let your house be as the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare to Judah), of the seed which Yahweh did give to thee of this young woman.'
\v 13 And Boaz taketh Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in unto her, and Yahweh gave to her conception, and she beareth a son.
\v 14 And the women say unto Naomi, 'Blessed is Yahweh who had not let a redeemer cease to thee to-day, and his name is proclaimed in Israel,
\v 15 and he had been to thee for a restorer of life, and for a nourisher of yours old age, for your daughter-in-law who had loved thee — who is better to thee than seven sons — had borne him.'
\v 16 And Naomi taketh the lad, and laid him in her bosom, and is to him for a nurse;
\v 17 and the neighbouring women give to him a name, saying, 'There had been a son born to Naomi,' and they call his name Obed; he is father of Jesse, father of David.
\v 18 And these are genealogies of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
\v 19 and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminidab,
\v 20 and Amminidab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
\v 21 and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
\v 22 and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
