\v 1 Thus said the Lord Yahweh to Edom, A report we have heard from Yahweh, And an ambassador among nations was sent, 'Rise, yea, let us rise against her for battle.'
\v 2 Lo, little I have made you among nations, Despised are you exceedingly.
\v 3 The pride of your heart had lifted you up, O dweller in clifts of a rock, (A high place is his habitation, He is saying in his heart, 'Who did bring me down to earth?')
\v 4 If you will go up high as an eagle, And if between stars you will set your nest, From there I bring you down, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 5 If thieves have come in to you, If spoilers of the night, How hast you been cut off! Do they not steal their sufficiency? If gatherers have come in to you, Do they not leave gleanings?
\v 6 How had Esau been searched out! Flowed out have his hidden things,
\v 7 Unto the border sent you have all yours allies, Forgotten you, prevailed over you, have your friends, Your bread they make a snare under you, There is no understanding in him!
\v 8 Is it not in that day — an affirmation of Yahweh, That I have destroyed the wise out of Edom, And understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\v 9 And broken down have been your mighty ones, O Teman, So that every one of the mount of Esau is cut off.
\v 10 For slaughter, for violence to your brother Jacob, Cover you did shame, And you hast been cut off — to the age.
\v 11 In the day of your standing over-against, In the day of strangers taking captive his force, And foreigners have entered his gates, And for Jerusalem have cast a lot, Even you are as one of them!
\v 12 And — you will not look on the day of your brother, On the day of his alienation, Nor will you rejoice over sons of Judah, In the day of their destruction, Nor make great your mouth in a day of distress.
\v 13 Nor come into a gate of My people in a day of their calamity, Nor look, even you, on its misfortune in a day of its calamity, Nor send forth against its force in a day of its calamity,
\v 14 Nor stand by the breach to cut off its escaped, Nor deliver up its remnant in a day of distress.
\v 15 For near is the day of Yahweh, on all the nations, As you hast done, it is done to you, Your deed did turn back on yours own head.
\v 16 For — as you have drunk on My holy mount, Drink do all the nations continually, And they have drunk and have swallowed, And they have been as they have not been.
\v 17 And in mount Zion there is an escape, And it had been holy, And the house of Jacob have possessed their possessions.
\v 18 And the house of Jacob had been a fire, And the house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Esau for stubble, And they have burned among them, And they have consumed them, And there is not a remnant to the house of Esau, For Yahweh had spoken.
\v 19 And they have possessed the south with the mount of Esau, And the low country with the Philistines, And they have possessed the field of Ephraim, And the field of Samaria, And Benjamin with Gilead.
\v 20 And the removed of this force of the sons of Israel, That is with the Canaanites unto Zarephat, And the removed of Jerusalem that is with the Sepharad, Possess the cities of the south.
\v 21 And gone up have saviours on mount Zion, To judge the mount of Esau, And the kingdom had been to Yahweh!'
