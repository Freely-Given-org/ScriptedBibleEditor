\c 1
\v 1 A word of Yahweh that had been unto Hosea, son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel:
\v 2 The commencement of Yahweh's speaking by Hosea. And Yahweh said unto Hosea, 'Go, take to you a woman of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms, for utterly go a-whoring did the land from after Yahweh.'
\v 3 And he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceiveth and beareth to him a son;
\v 4 and Yahweh said unto him, 'Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and have caused to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel;
\v 5 and it had come to pass in that day that I have broken the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.'
\v 6 And she conceiveth again, and beareth a daughter, and He said to him, 'Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I add no more to pity the house of Israel, for I do utterly take them away;
\v 7 and the house of Judah I pity, and have saved them by Yahweh their God, and do not save them by bow, and by sword, and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.'
\v 8 And she weaneth Lo-Ruhamah, and conceiveth, and beareth a son;
\v 9 and He said, 'Call his name Lo-Ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not for you;
\v 10 and the number of the sons of Israel had been as the sand of the sea, that is not measured nor numbered, and it had come to pass in the place where it is said to them, Ye are not My people, it is said to them, Sons of the Living God;
\v 11 and gathered have been the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel together, and they have appointed to themselves one head, and have gone up from the land, for great is the day of Jezreel.
\c 2
\v 1 Say you to your brethren — Ammi, And to your sisters — Ruhamah.
\v 2 Plead you with your mother — plead, (For she is not My wife, and I am not her husband,) And she turneth her whoredoms from before her, And her adulteries from between her breasts,
\v 3 Lest I strip her naked. And have set her up as in the day of her birth, And have made her as a wilderness, And have set her as a dry land, And have put her to death with thirst.
\v 4 And her sons I do not pity, For sons of whoredoms are they,
\v 5 For gone a-whoring had their mother, Acted shamefully had their conceiver, For she had said, I go after my lovers, Those giving my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
\v 6 Therefore, behold, I am hedging up your way with thorns, And I have made for her a wall, And her paths she did not find.
\v 7 And she had pursued her lovers, And she did not overtake them, And had sought them, and did not find, And she had said: I go, and I turn back unto My first husband, For — better to me then than now.
\v 8 And she knew not that I had given to her, The corn, and the new wine, and the oil. Yea, silver I did multiply to her, And the gold they prepared for Baal.
\v 9 Therefore do I turn back, And I have taken My corn in its season, And My new wine in its appointed time, And I have taken away My wool and My flax, covering her nakedness.
\v 10 And now do I reveal her dishonour before the eyes of her lovers, And none did deliver her out of My hand.
\v 11 And I have caused to cease all her joy, Her festival, her new moon, and her sabbath, Even all her appointed times,
\v 12 And made desolate her vine and her fig-tree, Of which she said, A gift they are to me, That my lovers have given to me, And I have made them for a forest, And consumed them had a beast of the field.
\v 13 And I have charged on her the days of the Baalim, To whom she made perfume, And putteth on her ring and her ornament, And went after her lovers, And Me forgat — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I am enticing her, And have caused her to go to the wilderness, And I have spoken unto her heart,
\v 15 And given to her her vineyards from there, And the valley of Achor for an opening of hope, And she had responded there as in the days of her youth, And as in the day of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.
\v 16 And it had come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh, You will call Me — My husband, And will not call Me any more — My lord.
\v 17 And I have turned aside the names of the lords from her mouth, And they are not remembered any more by their name.
\v 18 And I have made to them a covenant in that day, with the beast of the field, And with the fowl of the heavens, And the creeping thing of the ground, And bow, and sword, and war I break from off the land, And have caused them to lie down confidently.
\v 19 And I have betrothed you to Me to the age, And betrothed you to Me in righteousness, And in judgment, and kindness, and mercies,
\v 20 And betrothed you to Me in faithfulness, And you hast known Yahweh.
\v 21 And it had come to pass in that day, I answer — an affirmation of Yahweh, I answer the heavens, and they answer the earth.
\v 22 And the earth did answer the corn, And the new wine, and the oil, And they answer Jezreel.
\v 23 And I have sowed her to Me in the land, And I have pitied Lo-Ruhamah, And I have said to Lo-Ammi, My people you are, and it said, My God!'
\c 3
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto me: 'Again, go, love a woman, loved of a friend, and an adulteress, like the loved of Yahweh, the sons of Israel, and they are turning unto other gods, and are lovers of grape-cakes.'
\v 2 And I buy her to me for fifteen silverlings, and a homer and a letech of barley;
\v 3 and I say unto her, 'Many days you will remain for Me, you will not go a-whoring, nor become any one's; and I also am for you.'
\v 4 For many days remain do the sons of Israel without a king, and there is no prince, and there is no sacrifice, and there is no standing pillar, and there is no ephod and teraphim.
\v 5 Afterwards turned back have the sons of Israel, and sought Yahweh their God, and David their king, and have hastened unto Yahweh, and unto His goodness, in the latter end of the days.
\c 4
\v 1 Hear a word of Yahweh, sons of Israel, For a strife is to Yahweh with inhabitants of the land, For there is no truth, nor kindness, Nor knowledge of God, in the land,
\v 2 Swearing, and lying, and murdering, And stealing, and committing adultery — have increased, And blood against blood had touched.
\v 3 Therefore mourn did the land, And weak is every dweller in it, With the beast of the field, And with the fowl of the heavens, And the fishes of the sea — they are removed.
\v 4 Only, let no one strive, nor reprove a man, And your people are as those striving with a priest.
\v 5 And you hast stumbled in the day, And stumbled had also a prophet with you in the night, And I have cut off your mother.
\v 6 Cut off have been My people for lack of knowledge, Because you knowledge hast rejected, I reject you from being priest to Me, And you forgettest the law of your God, I forget your sons, I also!
\v 7 According to their abundance so they sinned against Me, Their honour into shame I change.
\v 8 The sin of My people they do eat, And unto their iniquity lift up their soul.
\v 9 And it had been, like people, like priest, And I have charged on it its ways, And its habitual doings I return to it.
\v 10 And they have eaten, and are not satisfied, They have gone a-whoring, and increase not, For they have left off taking heed to Yahweh.
\v 11 Whoredom, and wine, and new wine, take the heart,
\v 12 My people at its staff asketh and its rod declareth to it, For a spirit of whoredoms had caused to err, And they go a-whoring from under their God.
\v 13 On tops of the mountains they do sacrifice, And on the hills they make perfume, Under oak, and poplar, and terebinth, For good is its shade.
\v 14 Therefore commit whoredom do your daughters, And your spouses commit adultery, I do not see after your daughters when they commit whoredom, And after your spouses when they commit adultery, For they with the harlots are separated, And with the whores they do sacrifice, A people that did not understand kicketh.
\v 15 Yough a harlot you are, O Israel, Let not Judah become guilty, And come not you in to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-Aven, Nor swear you, Yahweh lived.
\v 16 For as a refractory heifer had Israel turned aside, Now did Yahweh feed them as a lamb in a large place.
\v 17 Joined to idols is Ephraim, let him alone.
\v 18 Sour is their drink, They have gone diligently a-whoring, Her protectors have loved shame thoroughly.
\v 19 Distressed her had wind with its wings, And they are ashamed of their sacrifices!
\c 5
\v 1 Hear this, O priests, and attend, O house of Israel, And, O house of the king, give ear, For the judgment is for you, For, a snare you have been on Mizpah, And a net spread out on Tabor.
\v 2 And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I am a fetter to them all.
\v 3 I have known Ephraim, And Israel had not been hid from me, For now you hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel.
\v 4 They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto their God, For a spirit of whoredoms is in their middle, And Yahweh they have not known.
\v 5 And humbled had been the excellency of Israel to his face, And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also had Judah with them.
\v 6 With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek Yahweh, and do not find, He had withdrawn from them.
\v 7 Against Yahweh they dealt treacherously, For strange sons they have begotten, Now consume them did a month with their portions.
\v 8 Blow you a cornet in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, Shout, O Beth-Aven, after you, O Benjamin.
\v 9 Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, Among the tribes of Israel I have made known a sure thing.
\v 10 Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, On them I do pour out as water My wrath.
\v 11 Oppressed is Ephraim, broken in judgment, When he pleased he went after the command.
\v 12 And I am as a moth to Ephraim, And as a rotten thing to the house of Judah.
\v 13 And see did Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, And Ephraim went unto Asshur, And sent unto a warlike king, And he is not able to give healing to you, Nor did he remove from you a scar.
\v 14 For I am as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the house of Judah, I — I tear and go, I bear away, and there is no deliverer.
\v 15 I go — I turn back unto My place, Till that they are desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do seek Me speedily!'
\c 6
\v 1 'Come, and we turn back unto Yahweh, For He had torn, and He did heal us, He did smite, and He bindeth us up.
\v 2 He did revive us after two days, In the third day He did raise us up, And we live before Him.
\v 3 And we know — we pursue to know Yahweh, As the dawn prepared is His going forth, And He came in as a shower to us, As gathered rain — sprinkling earth.'
\v 4 What do I do to you, O Ephraim? What do I do to you, O Judah? Your goodness is as a cloud of the morning, And as dew rising early — going.
\v 5 Therefore I have hewed by prophets, I have killed them by sayings of My mouth, And My judgments to the light went forth.
\v 6 For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, And a knowledge of God above burnt-offerings.
\v 7 And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, There they dealt treacherously against me.
\v 8 Gilead is a city of workers of iniquity, Slippery from blood.
\v 9 And as bands do wait for a man, A company of priests do murder — the way to Shechem, For wickedness they have done.
\v 10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, There is the whoredom of Ephraim — defiled is Israel.
\v 11 Also, O Judah, appointed is a harvest to you, In My turning back to the captivity of My people!
\c 7
\v 1 'When I give healing to Israel, Then revealed is the iniquity of Ephraim, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they have wrought falsehood, And a thief did come in, Stript off had a troop in the street,
\v 2 And they do not say to their heart, That all their evil I have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings, Over-against My face they have been.
\v 3 With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their lies — princes.
\v 4 All of them are adulterers, Like a burning oven of a baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough, till its leavening.
\v 5 A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves with the poison of wine, He had drawn out his hand with scorners.
\v 6 For they have drawn near, As an oven is their heart, In their lying in wait all the night sleep did their baker, Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.
\v 7 All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none calling unto Me among them.
\v 8 Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim had been a cake unturned.
\v 9 Devoured have strangers his power, And he had not known, Also old age had sprinkled itself on him, And he had not known.
\v 10 And humbled had been the excellency of Israel to his face, And they have not turned back unto Yahweh their God, Nor have they sought Him for all this.
\v 11 And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they called on — to Asshur they have gone.
\v 12 When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company had heard.
\v 13 Woe to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them, for they transgressed against Me, And I — I ransom them, and they have spoken lies against Me,
\v 14 And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn aside against Me.
\v 15 And I instructed — I strengthened their arms, And concerning Me they think evil!
\v 16 They turn back — not to the Most High, They have been as a deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the insolence of their tongue, This is their derision in the land of Egypt!
\c 8
\v 1 Unto your mouth — a trumpet, As an eagle against the house of Yahweh, Because they transgressed My covenant, And against My law they have rebelled.
\v 2 To Me they cry, 'My God, we — Israel — have known Thee.'
\v 3 Cast off good had Israel, an enemy pursueth him.
\v 4 They have made kings, and not by Me, They have made princes, and I have not known, Their silver and their gold they have made to them idols, So that they are cut off.
\v 5 Cast off had your calf, O Samaria, Burned had Mine anger against them, Till when are they not capable of purity?
\v 6 For even it is of Israel; an artificer made it, And it is not God, For the calf of Samaria is fragments!
\v 7 For wind they sow, and a hurricane they reap, Stalk it had none — a shoot not yielding grain, If so be it yield — strangers do swallow it up.
\v 8 Israel had been swallowed up, Now they have been among nations, As a vessel in which is no delight.
\v 9 For they — they have gone up to Asshur, A wild ass alone by himself is Ephraim, They have hired lovers!
\v 10 Also though they hire among nations, Now I gather them, and they are pained a little, From the burden of a king of princes.
\v 11 Because Ephraim did multiply altars to sin, They have been to him altars to sin.
\v 12 I write for him numerous things of My law, As a strange thing they have been reckoned.
\v 13 The sacrifices of Mine offerings! They sacrifice flesh, and they eat, Yahweh had not accepted them, Now did He remember their iniquity, And inspect their sin, They — to Egypt they turn back.
\v 14 And forget did Israel his Maker, and built temples, And Judah had multiplied cities of defence, And I have sent a fire into his cities, And it had consumed their palaces!
\c 9
\v 1 'Rejoice not, O Israel, be not joyful like the peoples, For you hast gone a-whoring from your God, You hast loved a gift near all floors of corn.
\v 2 Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine did fail in her,
\v 3 They do not abide in the land of Yahweh, And turned back had Ephraim to Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they eat.
\v 4 They pour not out wine to Yahweh, Nor are they sweet to Him, Their sacrifices are as bread of mourners to them, All eating it are unclean: For their bread is for themselves, It did not come into the house of Yahweh.
\v 5 What do you at the day appointed? And at the day of Yahweh's festival?
\v 6 For, behold, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of their silver, Nettles possess them — a thorn is in their tents.
\v 7 Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days of recompence, Israel did know! a fool is the prophet, Mad is the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of yours iniquity, And great is the hatred.
\v 8 Ephraim is looking away from My God, The prophet! a snare of a fowler is over all his ways, Hatred is in the house of his God.
\v 9 They have gone deep — have done corruptly, As in the days of Gibeah, He did remember their iniquity, He did inspect their sins.
\v 10 As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your fathers, They — they have gone in to Baal-Peor, And are separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like their love.
\v 11 Ephraim is as a fowl, Fly away did their honour, without birth, And without womb, and without conception.
\v 12 For though they nourish their sons, I have made them childless — without man, Surely also, woe to them, when I turn aside from them.
\v 13 Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in comeliness, And Ephraim is to bring out unto a slayer his sons.
\v 14 Give to them, Yahweh — what will You give? Give to them miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.
\v 15 All their evil is in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads are apostates.
\v 16 Ephraim had been smitten, Their root had dried up, fruit they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to death the desired of their womb.
\v 17 Reject them did my God, Because they have not hearkened to Him, And they are wanderers among nations!
\c 10
\v 1 An empty vine is Israel, Fruit he made like to himself, According to the abundance of his fruit, He had multiplied for the altars, According to the goodness of his land, They have made goodly standing-pillars.
\v 2 Their heart had been divided, now they are guilty, He did break down their altars, He did destroy their standing-pillars.
\v 3 For now they say: We have no king, Because we have not feared Yahweh, And the king — what did he for us?
\v 4 They have spoken words, To swear falsehood in making a covenant, And flourished as a poisonous herb had judgment, on the furrows of a field.
\v 5 For the calves of Beth-Aven fear do inhabitants of Samaria, Surely mourned on account of it had its people, And its priests on account of it leap about, Because of its honour, for it had removed from it,
\v 6 Also it to Asshur is carried, a present to a warlike king, Shame did Ephraim receive, And ashamed is Israel of its own counsel.
\v 7 Cut off is Samaria! Its king is as a chip on the face of the waters.
\v 8 And destroyed have been high places of Aven, the sin of Israel. Thorn and bramble go up on their altars, And they have said to hills, Cover us, And to heights, Fall upon us.
\v 9 From the days of Gibeah you hast sinned, O Israel, There they have stood, Not overtake them in Gibeah did battle, Because of sons of perverseness.
\v 10 When I desire, then I do bind them, And gathered against them have peoples, When they bind themselves to their two iniquities.
\v 11 And Ephraim is a trained heifer — loving to thresh, And I — I have passed over on the goodness of its neck, I cause one to ride Ephraim, Plough did Judah, harrow for him did Jacob.
\v 12 Sow for yourselves in righteousness, Reap according to loving-kindness, Till for yourselves tillage of knowledge, To seek Yahweh, Till he come and shew righteousness to you.
\v 13 Ye have ploughed wickedness, Perversity you have reaped, Ye have eaten the fruit of lying, For you hast trusted in your way, In the abundance of your might.
\v 14 And rise did a tumult among your people, And all your fortresses are spoiled, As the spoiling of Shalman of Beth-Arbel, In a day of battle, Mother against sons dashed in pieces.
\v 15 Thus had Beth-El done to you, Because of the evil of your wickedness, In the dawn cut off utterly is a king of Israel!
\c 11
\v 1 Because Israel is a youth, and I love him, Out of Egypt I have called for My Son.
\v 2 They have called to them rightly, They have gone from before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images they make perfume.
\v 3 And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them.
\v 4 With cords of man I do draw them, With thick cords of love, And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, And I incline unto him — I feed him.
\v 5 He turneth not back unto the land of Egypt, And Asshur — he is his king, For they have refused to return.
\v 6 Grievous had been the sword in his cities, And it had ended his bars, and consumed — from their own counsels.
\v 7 And My people are hanging in suspense, about My returning, And unto the Most High they do call, Together they exalt not.
\v 8 How do I give you up, O Ephraim? Do I deliver you up, O Israel? How do I make you as Admah? Do I set you as Zeboim? Turned in Me is My heart, kindled together have been My repentings.
\v 9 I do not the fierceness of My anger, I turn not back to destroy Ephraim, For God I am, and not a man. In your middle the Holy One, and I enter not in enmity,
\v 10 After Yahweh they go — as a lion He roareth, When He did roar, then tremble do the sons from the west.
\v 11 They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt, And as a dove out of the land of Asshur, And I have caused them to dwell in their own houses, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 12 Compassed Me with feigning had Ephraim, And with deceit the house of Israel. And Judah again is ruling with God, And with the Holy Ones is faithful!
\c 12
\v 1 Ephraim is enjoying wind, And is pursuing an east wind, All the day lying and spoiling he multiplieth, And a covenant with Asshur they make, And oil to Egypt is carried.
\v 2 And a controversy had Yahweh with Judah, To lay a charge on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He returneth to him.
\v 3 In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his strength he was a prince with God,
\v 4 Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcame by weeping, And he made supplication to Him, At Bethel He did find him, And there He did speak with us,
\v 5 Even Yahweh, God of the Hosts, Yahweh is His memorial.
\v 6 And you, through your God, will turn, Kindness and judgment keep you, And wait on your God continually.
\v 7 Canaan! in his hand are balances of deceit! To oppress he had loved.
\v 8 And Ephraim said: 'Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself, All my labours — they find not against me iniquity that is sin.'
\v 9 And I — Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt, Again do I turn you back into tents, As in the days of the appointed time.
\v 10 And I have spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied vision, And by the hand of the prophets I use similes.
\v 11 Surely Gilead is iniquity, Only, vanity they have been, In Gilead bullocks they have sacrificed, Also their altars are as heaps, on the furrows of a field.
\v 12 And Jacob did flee to the country of Aram, And Israel did serve for a wife, Yea, for a wife he had kept watch.
\v 13 And by a prophet had Yahweh brought up Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet it had been watched.
\v 14 Ephraim had provoked most bitterly, And his blood on himself he leaveth, And his reproach turn back to him did his Lord!
\c 13
\v 1 When Ephraim spoke tremblingly, He had been lifted up in Israel, When he became guilty in Baal he dieth.
\v 2 And now do they add to sin, And make to them a molten image of their silver, By their own understanding — idols, A work of artisans — all of it, Of them they say, who are sacrificers among men, 'The calves let them kiss.'
\v 3 Therefore they are as a cloud of the morning, And as dew, rising early, going away, As chaff tossed about out of a floor, And as smoke out of a window.
\v 4 And I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt, And a God besides Me you will not know, And a Saviour — there is none save Me.
\v 5 I — I have known you in a wilderness, In a land of droughts.
\v 6 According to their feedings they are satiated, They have been satiated, And their heart is lifted up, Therefore they have forgotten Me,
\v 7 And I am to them as a lion, As a leopard by the way I look out.
\v 8 I do meet them as a bereaved bear, And I rend the enclosure of their heart.
\v 9 And I consume them there as a lioness, A beast of the field did rend them.
\v 10 You hast destroyed thyself, O Israel, But in Me is your help, Where is your king now — And he did save you in all your cities? And your judges of whom you did say, 'Give to me a king and heads?'
\v 11 I give to you a king in Mine anger, And I take away in My wrath.
\v 12 Bound up is the iniquity of Ephraim, Hidden is his sin,
\v 13 Pangs of a travailing woman come to him, He is a son not wise, For he remaineth not the time for the breaking forth of sons.
\v 14 From the hand of Sheol I do ransom them, From death I redeem them, Where is your plague, O death? Where your destruction, O Sheol? Repentance is hid from Mine eyes.
\v 15 Yough he among brethren produceth fruit, Come in did an east wind, a wind of Yahweh, From a wilderness it is coming up, And it drieth up his fountain, And become dry did his spring, It — it spoileth a treasure — every desirable vessel.
\v 16 Become desolate did Samaria, Because she had rebelled against her God, By sword they do fall, Their sucklings are dashed in pieces, And its pregnant ones are ripped up!
\c 14
\v 1 Turn back, O Israel, unto Yahweh your God, For you hast stumbled by yours iniquity.
\v 2 Take with you words, and turn to Yahweh, Say you unto Him: 'Take away all iniquity, and give good, And we do render the fruit of our lips.
\v 3 Asshur did not save us, on a horse we ride not, Nor do we say any more, Our God, to the work of our hands, For in Thee find mercy did the fatherless.'
\v 4 I heal their backsliding, I love them freely, For turned back had Mine anger from him.
\v 5 I am as dew to Israel, he flourisheth as a lily, And he striketh forth his roots as Lebanon.
\v 6 Go on do his sucklings, And his beauty is as an olive, And he had fragrance as Lebanon.
\v 7 Return do the dwellers under his shadow, They revive as corn, and flourish as a vine, His memorial is as wine of Lebanon.
\v 8 O Ephraim, what to Me any more with idols? I — I afflicted, and I cause him to sing: 'I am as a green fir-tree,' From Me is your fruit found.
\v 9 Who is wise, and did understand these? Prudent, and knoweth them? For upright are the ways of Yahweh, And the righteous go on in them, And the transgressors stumble therein!
