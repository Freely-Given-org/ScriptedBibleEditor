\v 1 And it came to pass, after the death of Joshua, that the sons of Israel ask at Yahweh, saying, 'Who did go up for us unto the Canaanite, at the commencement, to fight against it?'
\v 2 And Yahweh said, 'Judah did go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand.'
\v 3 And Judah said to Simeon his brother, 'Go up with me into my lot, and we fight against the Canaanite — and I have gone, even I, with you into your lot;' and Simeon went with him.
\v 4 And Judah went up, and Yahweh gave the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand, and they smite them in Bezek — ten thousand men;
\v 5 and they find Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fight against him, and smite the Canaanite and the Perizzite.
\v 6 And Adoni-Bezek fleeth, and they pursue after him, and seize him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes,
\v 7 and Adoni-Bezek said, 'Seventy kings — their thumbs and their great toes cut off — have been gathering under my table; as I have done so had God repaid to me;' and they bring him in to Jerusalem, and he dieth there.
\v 8 And the sons of Judah fight against Jerusalem, and capture it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and the city they have sent into fire;
\v 9 and afterwards have the sons of Judah gone down to fight against the Canaanite, inhabiting the hill-country, and the south, and the low country;
\v 10 and Judah went unto the Canaanite who is dwelling in Hebron (and the name of Hebron formerly is Kirjath-Arba), and they smite Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\v 11 And he went there unto the inhabitants of Debir (and the name of Debir formerly is Kirjath-Sepher),
\v 12 and Caleb said, 'He who smiteth Kirjath-Sepher — and had captured it — then I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.'
\v 13 And Othniel son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, did capture it, and he gave to him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
\v 14 And it came to pass in her coming in, that she persuadeth him to ask from her father the field, and she lighteth from off the ass, and Caleb said to her, 'What — to you?'
\v 15 And she said to him, 'Give to me a blessing; when the south land you hast given me — then you hast given to me springs of water; and Caleb gave to her the upper springs and the lower springs.
\v 16 And the sons of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, have gone up out of the city of palms with the sons of Judah to the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad, and they go and dwell with the people.
\v 17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smite the Canaanite inhabiting Zephad, and devote it; and one called the name of the city Hormah.
\v 18 And Judah captureth Gaza and its border, and Askelon and its border, and Ekron and its border;
\v 19 and Yahweh is with Judah, and he occupieth the hill-country, but not to dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, for they have chariots of iron.
\v 20 And they give to Caleb Hebron, as Moses had spoken, and he dispossesseth there the three sons of Anak.
\v 21 And the Jebusite, inhabiting Jerusalem, the sons of Benjamin have not dispossessed; and the Jebusite dwelleth with the sons of Benjamin, in Jerusalem, till this day.
\v 22 And the house of Joseph go up — even they — to Beth-El, and Yahweh is with them;
\v 23 and the house of Joseph cause men to spy about Beth-El (and the name of the city formerly is Luz),
\v 24 and the watchers see a man coming out from the city, and say to him, 'Shew us, we pray you, the entrance of the city, and we have done with you kindness.'
\v 25 And he sheweth them the entrance of the city, and they smite the city by the mouth of the sword, and the man and all his family they have sent away;
\v 26 and the man went to the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz — it is its name unto this day.
\v 27 And Manasseh had not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns, and Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Iblaim and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the Canaanite is desirous to dwell in that land;
\v 28 and it came to pass, when Israel had been strong, that he setteth the Canaanite to tribute, and had not utterly dispossessed it.
\v 29 And Ephraim had not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in its middle, in Gezer.
\v 30 Zebulun had not dispossessed the inhabitants of Kitron, and the inhabitants of Nahalol, and the Canaanite dwelleth in its middle, and they become tributary.
\v 31 Asher had not dispossessed the inhabitants of Accho, and the inhabitants of Zidon, and Ahlab, and Achzib, and Helbah, and Aphik, and Rehob;
\v 32 and the Asherite dwelleth in the middle of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the land, for it had not dispossessed them.
\v 33 Naphtali had not dispossessed the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh, and the inhabitants of Beth-Anath, and he dwelleth in the middle of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and of Beth-Anath have become tributary to them.
\v 34 And the Amorites press the sons of Dan to the mountain, for they have not suffered them to go down to the valley;
\v 35 and the Amorite is desirous to dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, and the hand of the house of Joseph is heavy, and they become tributary;
\v 36 and the border of the Amorite is from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock and upward.
\c 2
\v 1 And a messenger of Yahweh went up from Gilgal unto Bochim,
\v 2 and said, 'I cause you to come up out of Egypt, and bring you in unto the land which I have sworn to your fathers, and say, I do not break My covenant with you to the age; and you — you make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land — their altars you break down; and you have not hearkened to My voice — what is this you have done?
\v 3 And I also have said, I do not cast them out from your presence, and they have been to you for adversaries, and their gods are to you for a snare.'
\v 4 And it came to pass, when the messenger of Yahweh spoke these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the people lift up their voice and weep,
\v 5 and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice there to Yahweh.
\v 6 And Joshua sent the people away, and the sons of Israel go, each to his inheritance, to possess the land;
\v 7 and the people serve Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, who saw all the great work of Yahweh which He did to Israel.
\v 8 And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten years,
\v 9 and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath-Heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of mount Gaash;
\v 10 and also all that generation have been gathered unto their fathers, and another generation riseth after them who have not known Yahweh, and even the work which He had done to Israel.
\v 11 And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and serve the Baalim,
\v 12 and forsake Yahweh, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and go after other gods (of the gods of the peoples who are round about them), and bow themselves to them, and provoke Yahweh,
\v 13 yea, they forsake Yahweh, and do service to Baal and to Ashtaroth.
\v 14 And the anger of Yahweh burneth against Israel, and He gave them into the hand of spoilers, and they spoil them, and He selleth them into the hand of their enemies round about, and they have not been able any more to stand before their enemies;
\v 15 in every place where they have gone out, the hand of Yahweh had been against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them, and they are distressed — greatly.
\v 16 And Yahweh raiseth up judges, and they save them from the hand of their spoilers;
\v 17 and also unto their judges they have not hearkened, but have gone a-whoring after other gods, and bow themselves to them; they have turned aside with haste out of the way in which their fathers walked to obey the commands of Yahweh — they have not done so.
\v 18 And when Yahweh raised up to them judges — then was Yahweh with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repenteth Yahweh, because of their groaning from the presence of their oppressors, and of those thrusting them away.
\v 19 And it had come to pass, at the death of the judge — they turn back and have done corruptly above their fathers, to go after other gods, to serve them, and to bow themselves to them; they have not fallen from their doings, and from their stiff way.
\v 20 And the anger of Yahweh did burn against Israel, and He said, 'Because that this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to My voice — 
\v 21 I also continue not to dispossess any from before them of the nations which Joshua had left when he dieth,
\v 22 in order to try Israel by them, whether they are keeping the way of Yahweh, to go in it, as their fathers kept it or not.'
\v 23 And Yahweh leaveth these nations, so as not to dispossess them hastily, and did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
\c 3
\v 1 And these are the nations which Yahweh left, to try Israel by them, all who have not known all the wars of Canaan;
\v 2 (only for the sake of the generations of the sons of Israel's knowing, to teach them war, only those who formerly have not known them) — 
\v 3 five princes of the Philistines, and all the Canaanite, and the Zidonian, and the Hivite inhabiting mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath;
\v 4 and they are to prove Israel by them, to know whether they obey the commands of Yahweh that He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\v 5 And the sons of Israel have dwelt in the middle of the Canaanite, the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
\v 6 and take their daughters to them for wives, and their daughters have given to their sons, and they serve their gods;
\v 7 and the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and forget Yahweh their God, and serve the Baalim and the shrines.
\v 8 And the anger of Yahweh burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of Chushan-Rishadaim king of Aram-Naharaim, and the sons of Israel serve Chushan-Rishadaim eight years;
\v 9 and the sons of Israel cry unto Yahweh, and Yahweh raiseth a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he saveth them — Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother;
\v 10 and the Spirit of Yahweh is upon him, and he judgeth Israel, and went out to battle, and Yahweh gave unto his hand Chushan-Rishadaim king of Aram, and strong is his hand against Chushan-Rishadaim;
\v 11 and the land rested forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz dieth,
\v 12 and the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh; and Yahweh strengtheneth Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because that they have done the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh;
\v 13 and he gathereth unto him the Bene-Ammon and Amalek, and went and smiteth Israel, and they possess the city of palms;
\v 14 and the sons of Israel serve Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
\v 15 And the sons of Israel cry unto Yahweh, and Yahweh raiseth to them a saviour, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite (a man — shut of his right hand), and the sons of Israel send by his hand a present to Eglon king of Moab;
\v 16 and Ehud made for himself a sword, and it had two mouths (a cubit is its length), and he girdeth it under his long robe on his right thigh;
\v 17 and he brought near the present to Eglon king of Moab, and Eglon is a very fat man.
\v 18 And it came to pass, when he had finished to bring near the present, that he sent away the people bearing the present,
\v 19 and he himself had turned back from the graven images which are at Gilgal, and said, 'A secret word I have unto you, O king;' and he said, 'Hush!' and go out from him do all those standing by him.
\v 20 And Ehud had come unto him, and he is sitting in the upper chamber of the wall which he had for himself, and Ehud said, 'A word of God I have unto you;' and he riseth from off the throne;
\v 21 and Ehud putteth forth his left hand, and took the sword from off his right thigh, and striketh it into his belly;
\v 22 and the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat shutteth on the blade, that he had not drawn the sword out of his belly, and it went out at the fundament.
\v 23 And Ehud went out at the porch, and shutteth the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and had bolted it;
\v 24 and he had gone out, and his servants have come in, and look, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber are bolted, and they say, 'He is only covering his feet in the inner chamber of the wall.'
\v 25 And they stay till confounded, and behold, he is not opening the doors of the upper chamber, and they take the key, and open, and behold, their lord is fallen to the earth — dead.
\v 26 And Ehud escaped during their tarrying, and had passed by the images, and is escaped to Seirath.
\v 27 And it came to pass, in his coming in, that he bloweth with a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and go down with him do the sons of Israel from the hill-country, and he before them;
\v 28 and he said unto them, 'Pursue after me, for Yahweh had given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand;' and they go down after him, and capture the passages of the Jordan towards Moab, and have not permitted a man to pass over.
\v 29 And they smite Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all robust, and every one a man of valour, and not a man had escaped,
\v 30 and Moab is humbled in that day under the hand of Israel; and the land rested eighty years.
\v 31 And after him had been Shamgar son of Anath, and he smiteth the Philistines — six hundred men — with an ox-goad, and he saveth — he also — Israel.
\c 4
\v 1 And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh when Ehud is dead,
\v 2 and Yahweh selleth them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who had reigned in Hazor, and the head of his host is Sisera, and he is dwelling in Harosheth of the Goyim;
\v 3 and the sons of Israel cry unto Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he had oppressed the sons of Israel mightily twenty years.
\v 4 And Deborah, a woman inspired, wife of Lapidoth, she is judging Israel at that time,
\v 5 and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-El, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel go up unto her for judgment.
\v 6 And she sent and called for Barak son of Abinoam, out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and said unto him, 'Hath not Yahweh, God of Israel, commanded? go, and you hast drawn towards mount Tabor, and hast taken with you ten thousand men, out of the sons of Naphtali, and out of the sons of Zebulun,
\v 7 and I have drawn unto you, unto the brook Kishon, Sisera, head of the host of Jabin, and his chariot, and his multitude, and have given him into your hand.'
\v 8 And Barak said unto her, 'If you will go with me, then I have gone; and if you will not go with me, I do not go;'
\v 9 and she said, 'I do certainly go with you; only, surely your glory is not on the way which you are going, for into the hand of a woman did Yahweh sell Sisera;' and Deborah riseth and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\v 10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went up — at his feet are ten thousand men — and Deborah went up with him.
\v 11 And Heber the Kenite had been separated from the Kenite, from the sons of Hobab father-in-law of Moses, and he stretcheth out his tent unto the oak in Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
\v 12 And they declare to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor,
\v 13 and Sisera called all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who are with him, from Harosheth of the Goyim, unto the brook Kishon.
\v 14 And Deborah said unto Barak, 'Rise, for this is the day in which Yahweh had given Sisera into your hand; had not Yahweh gone out before you?' And Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\v 15 And Yahweh destroyeth Sisera, and all the chariots, and all the camp, by the mouth of the sword, before Barak, and Sisera came down from off the chariot, and fleeth on his feet.
\v 16 And Barak had pursued after the chariots and after the camp, unto Harosheth of the Goyim, and all the camp of Sisera falleth by the mouth of the sword — there had not been left even one.
\v 17 And Sisera had fled on his feet unto the tent of Jael wife of Heber the Kenite, for peace is between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite;
\v 18 and Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, 'Turn aside, my lord, turn aside unto me, fear not;' and he turneth aside unto her, into the tent, and she covereth him with a coverlet.
\v 19 And he said unto her, 'Give me to drink, I pray you, a little water, for I am thirsty;' and she opened the bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covereth him.
\v 20 And he said unto her, 'Stand at the opening of the tent, and it had been, if any did come in, and had asked you, and said, Is there a man here? that you hast said, There is not.'
\v 21 And Jael wife of Heber took the pin of the tent, and took the hammer in her hand, and went unto him gently, and striketh the pin into his temples, and it fasteneth in the earth — and he had been fast asleep, and is weary — and he dieth.
\v 22 And behold, Barak is pursuing Sisera, and Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, 'Come, and I shew you the man whom you are seeking;' and he came in unto her, and behold, Sisera is fallen — dead, and the pin in his temples.
\v 23 And God humbleth on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel,
\v 24 and the hand of the sons of Israel went, going on and becoming hard on Jabin king of Canaan, till that they have cut off Jabin king of Canaan.
\c 5
\v 1 And Deborah singeth — also Barak son of Abinoam — on that day, saying: — 
\v 2 'For freeing freemen in Israel, For a people willingly offering themselves Bless you Yahweh.
\v 3 Hear, you kings; give ear, you princes, I, to Yahweh, I — I do sing, I sing praise to Yahweh, God of Israel.
\v 4 Yahweh, in Your going forth out of Seir, In Your stepping out of the field of Edom, Earth trembled, also the heavens dropped, Also thick clouds dropped water.
\v 5 Hills flowed from the face of Yahweh, This one — Sinai — From the face of Yahweh, God of Israel.
\v 6 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath — In the days of Jael — The ways have ceased, And those going in the paths go in crooked ways.
\v 7 Villages ceased in Israel — they ceased, Till that I arose — Deborah, That I arose, a mother in Israel.
\v 8 He chooseth new gods, Then war is at the gates! A shield is not seen — and a spear Among forty thousand in Israel.
\v 9 My heart is to the lawgivers of Israel, Who are offering themselves willingly among the people, Bless you Yahweh!
\v 10 Riders on white asses — Sitters on a long robe — And walkers by the way — meditate!
\v 11 By the voice of shouters Between the places of drawing water, There they give out righteous acts of Yahweh, Righteous acts of His villages in Israel, Then ruled in the gates have the people of Yahweh.
\v 12 Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song; Rise, Barak, and take captive your captivity, Son of Abinoam.
\v 13 Then him who is left of the honourable ones He caused to rule the people of Yahweh, He caused me to rule among the mighty.
\v 14 Out of Ephraim their root is against Amalek. After you, Benjamin, among your peoples. Out of Machir came down lawgivers, And out of Zebulun those drawing with the reed of a writer.
\v 15 And princes in Issachar are with Deborah, Yea, Issachar is right with Barak, Into the valley he was sent on his feet. In the divisions of Reuben, Great are the decrees of heart!
\v 16 Why hast you abode between the boundaries, To hear lowings of herds? For the divisions of Reuben, Great are the searchings of heart!
\v 17 Gilead beyond the Jordan did tabernacle, And Dan — why did he sojourn in ships? Asher had abode at the haven of the seas, And by his creeks did tabernacle.
\v 18 Zebulun is a people who exposed its soul to death, Naphtali also — on high places of the field.
\v 19 Kings came — they fought; Then fought kings of Canaan, In Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; Gain of money they took not!
\v 20 From the heavens they fought: The stars from their highways fought with Sisera.
\v 21 The brook Kishon swept them away, The brook most ancient — the brook Kishon. You will tread down strength, O my soul!
\v 22 Then broken were the horse-heels, By pransings — pransings of its mighty ones.
\v 23 Curse Meroz — said a messenger of Yahweh, Cursing, curse you its inhabitants, For they came not to the help of Yahweh, To the help of Yahweh among the mighty!
\v 24 Blessed above women is Jael, Wife of Heber the Kenite, Above women in the tent she is blessed.
\v 25 Water he asked — milk she gave; In a lordly dish she brought near butter.
\v 26 Her hand to the pin she sent forth, And her right hand to the labourers' hammer, And she hammered Sisera — she smote his head, Yea, she smote, and it passed through his temple.
\v 27 Between her feet he bowed — He fell, he lay down; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell — destroyed.
\v 28 Through the window she had looked out — Yea, she crieth out — the mother of Sisera, Through the lattice: Wherefore is his chariot delaying to come? Wherefore tarried have the steps of his chariot?
\v 29 The wise ones, her princesses, answer her, Yea, she returneth her sayings to herself:
\v 30 Do they not find? — they apportion spoil, A female — two females — for every head, Spoil of finger-work for Sisera, Spoil of embroidered finger-work, Finger-work — a pair of embroidered things, For the necks of the spoil!
\v 31 So do all Thine enemies perish, O Yahweh, And those loving Him are As the going out of the sun in its might!' and the land rested forty years.
\c 6
\v 1 And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of Midian seven years,
\v 2 and the hand of Midian is strong against Israel, from the presence of Midian have the sons of Israel made for themselves the flowings which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
\v 3 And it had been, if Israel had sowed, that Midian had come up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east, yea, they have come up against him,
\v 4 and encamp against them, and destroy the increase of the land till yours entering Gaza; and they leave no sustenance in Israel, either sheep, or ox, or ass;
\v 5 for they and their cattle come up, with their tents; they come in as the fulness of the locust for multitude, and of them and of their cattle there is no number, and they come into the land to destroy it.
\v 6 And Israel is very weak from the presence of Midian, and the sons of Israel cry unto Yahweh.
\v 7 And it came to pass when the sons of Israel have cried unto Yahweh, concerning Midian,
\v 8 that Yahweh sent a man, a prophet, unto the sons of Israel, and he said to them, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, I — I have brought you up out of Egypt, and I bring you out from a house of servants,
\v 9 and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all your oppressors, and I cast them out from your presence, and I give to you their land,
\v 10 and I say to you, I am Yahweh your God, you do not fear the gods of the Amorite in whose land you are dwelling: — and you have not hearkened to My voice.'
\v 11 And the messenger of Yahweh came and sitteth under the oak which is in Ophrah, which is to Joash the Abi-Ezrite, and Gideon his son is beating out wheat in the wine-press, to remove it from the presence of the Midianites;
\v 12 and the messenger of Yahweh appeareth unto him, and said unto him, 'Yahweh is with you, O mighty one of valour.'
\v 13 And Gideon said unto him, 'O, my lord — and Yahweh is with us! — and why had all this found us? and where are all His wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying, Hath not Yahweh brought us up out of Egypt? and now Yahweh had left us, and did give us into the hand of Midian.'
\v 14 And Yahweh turneth unto him and said, 'Go in this — your power; and you hast saved Israel out of the hand of Midian — have not I sent you.'
\v 15 And he said unto him, 'O, my lord, wherewith do I save Israel? behold, my chief is weak in Manasseh, and I the least in the house of my father.'
\v 16 And Yahweh said unto him, 'Because I am with you — you hast smitten the Midianites as one man.'
\v 17 And he said unto Him, 'If, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, then You hast done for me a sign that You are speaking with me.
\v 18 Move not, I pray Thee, from this, till my coming in unto Thee, and I have brought out my present, and put it before Thee;' and he said, 'I — I do abide till your return.'
\v 19 And Gideon had gone in, and prepared a kid of the goats, and of an ephah of flour unleavened things; the flesh he had put in a basket, and the broth he had put in a pot, and he brought out unto Him, unto the place of the oak, and brought it nigh.
\v 20 And the messenger of God said unto him, 'Take the flesh and the unleavened things, and place on this rock — and the broth pour out;' and he did so.
\v 21 And the messenger of Yahweh putteth forth the end of the staff which is in His hand, and came against the flesh, and against the unleavened things, and the fire went up out of the rock and consumeth the flesh and the unleavened things — and the messenger of Yahweh had gone from his eyes.
\v 22 And Gideon saw that He is a messenger of Yahweh, and Gideon said, 'Alas, Lord Yahweh! because that I have seen a messenger of Yahweh face to face!'
\v 23 And Yahweh said to him, 'Peace to you; fear not; you will not die.'
\v 24 And Gideon built there an altar to Yahweh, and called it Yahweh-Shalom, unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-Ezrites.
\v 25 And it came to pass, on that night, that Yahweh said to him, 'Take the young ox which is to your father, and the second bullock of seven years, and you hast thrown down the altar of Baal which is to your father, and the shrine which is by it you will cut down,
\v 26 and you hast built an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold, by the arrangement, and hast taken the second bullock, and caused to ascend a burnt-offering with the wood of the shrine which you cuttest down.'
\v 27 And Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken unto him, and it came to pass, because he had been afraid of the house of his father, and the men of the city, to do it by day, that he did it by night.
\v 28 And the men of the city rise early in the morning, and behold, broken down had been the altar of Baal, and the shrine which is by it had been cut down, and the second bullock had been offered on the altar which is built.
\v 29 And they say one to another, 'Who had done this thing?' and they inquire and seek, and they say, 'Gideon son of Joash had done this thing.'
\v 30 And the men of the city say unto Joash, 'Bring out your son, and he dieth, because he had broken down the altar of Baal, and because he had cut down the shrine which is by it.'
\v 31 And Joash said to all who have stood against him, 'Ye, do you plead for Baal? you — do you save him? he who pleadeth for him is put to death during the morning; if he is a god he himself did plead against him, because he had broken down his altar.'
\v 32 And he called him, on that day, Jerubbaal, saying, 'The Baal did plead against him, because he had broken down his altar.'
\v 33 And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley of Jezreel,
\v 34 and the Spirit of Yahweh had clothed Gideon, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and Abi-Ezer is called after him;
\v 35 and messengers he had sent into all Manasseh, and it also is called after him; and messengers he had sent into Asher, and into Zebulun, and into Naphtali, and they come up to meet them.
\v 36 And Gideon said unto God, 'If You are Saviour of Israel by my hand, as You hast spoken,
\v 37 behold, I am placing the fleece of wool in the threshing-floor: if dew is on the fleece alone, and on all the earth drought — then I have known that You will save Israel by my hand, as You hast spoken;'
\v 38 and it is so, and he riseth early on the morrow, and presseth the fleece, and wringeth dew out of the fleece — the fulness of the bowl, of water.
\v 39 And Gideon said unto God, 'Let not Thine anger burn against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray Thee, only this time with the fleece — let there be, I pray Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let there be dew.'
\v 40 And God did so on that night, and there is drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth there had been dew.
\c 7
\v 1 And Jerubbaal (he is Gideon) riseth early, and all the people who are with him, and they encamp by the well of Harod, and the camp of Midian had been on the south of him, on the height of Moreh, in the valley.
\v 2 And Yahweh said unto Gideon, 'Too many are the people who are with you for My giving Midian into their hand, lest Israel beautify itself against Me, saying, My hand had given salvation to me;
\v 3 and now, call, I pray you, in the ears of the people, saying, Whoso is afraid and trembling, let him turn back and go early from mount Gilead;' and there turn back of the people twenty and two thousand, and ten thousand have been left.
\v 4 And Yahweh said unto Gideon, 'Yet are the people too many; bring them down unto the water, and I refine it for you there; and it had been, he of whom I say unto you, This did go with you — he did go with you; and any of whom I say unto you, This did not go with you — he did not go.'
\v 5 And he brought down the people unto the water, and Yahweh said unto Gideon, 'Every one who lappeth with his tongue of the water as the dog lappeth — you will set him apart; also every one who boweth on his knees to drink.'
\v 6 And the number of those lapping with their hand unto their mouth is three hundred men, and all the rest of the people have bowed down on their knees to drink water.
\v 7 And Yahweh said unto Gideon, 'By the three hundred men who are lapping I save you, and have given Midian into your hand, and all the people go, each to his place.'
\v 8 And the people take the provision in their hand, and their trumpets, and every man of Israel he had sent away, each to his tents; and on the three hundred men he had kept hold, and the camp of Midian had been by him at the lower part of the valley.
\v 9 And it came to pass, on that night, that Yahweh said unto him, 'Rise, go down into the camp, for I have given it into your hand;
\v 10 and if you are afraid to go down — go down, you and Phurah your young man, unto the camp,
\v 11 and you hast heard what they speak, and afterwards are your hands strengthened, and you hast gone down against the camp.' And he went down, he and Phurah his young man, unto the extremity of the fifties who are in the camp;
\v 12 and Midian and Amalek, and all the sons of the east are lying in the valley, as the locust for multitude, and of their camels there is no number, as sand which is on the sea-shore for multitude.
\v 13 And Gideon came in, and behold, a man is recounting to his companion a dream, and said, 'Lo, a dream I have dreamed, and behold, a cake of barley-bread is turning itself over into the camp of Midian, and it came in unto the tent, and smiteth it, and it falleth, and turneth it upwards, and the tent had fallen.'
\v 14 And his companion answereth and said, 'This is nothing save the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God had given into his hand Midian and all the camp.'
\v 15 And it came to pass, when Gideon heareth the narration of the dream and its interpretation, that he boweth himself, and turneth back unto the camp of Israel, and said, 'Rise you, for Yahweh had given into your hand the camp of Midian.'
\v 16 And he divideth the three hundred men into three detachments, and putteth trumpets into the hand of all of them, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
\v 17 And he said unto them, 'Look at me, and thus do; and behold, I am coming into the extremity of the camp — and it had been — as I do so you do;
\v 18 and I have blown with a trumpet — I and all who are with me, and you have blown with trumpets, even you, round about all the camp, and have said, For Yahweh and for Gideon.'
\v 19 And Gideon came — and the hundred men who are with him — into the extremity of the camp, at the beginning of the middle watch (it had only just confirmed the watchmen), and they blow with trumpets — dashing in pieces also the pitchers which are in their hand;
\v 20 and the three detachments blow with trumpets, and break the pitchers, and keep hold with their left hand on the lamps, and with their right hand on the trumpets to blow, and they cry, 'The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.'
\v 21 And they stand each in his place, round about the camp, and all the camp runneth, and they shout, and flee;
\v 22 and the three hundred blow the trumpets, and Yahweh setteth the sword of each against his companion, even through all the camp; and the camp fleeth unto Beth-Shittah, at Zererath, unto the border of Abel-Meholah, by Tabbath.
\v 23 And the men of Israel are called from Naphtali, and from Asher, and from all Manasseh, and pursue after Midian.
\v 24 And messengers had sent Gideon into all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, 'Come down to meet Midian, and capture before them the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan;' and every man of Ephraim is called, and they capture the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan,
\v 25 and they capture two of the heads of Midian, Oreb, and Zeeb, and slay Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they have killed at the wine-vat of Zeeb, and they pursue unto Midian; and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they have brought in unto Gideon beyond the Jordan.
\c 8
\v 1 And the men of Ephraim say unto him, 'What is this thing you hast done to us — not to call for us when you did go to fight with Midian?' and they strive with him severely;
\v 2 and he said unto them, 'What have I done now like you? are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the harvest of Abi-Ezer?
\v 3 Into your hand had God given the heads of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what have I been able to do like you?' Then their temper desisted from off him in his speaking this thing.
\v 4 And Gideon came in unto the Jordan, passing over, he and the three hundred men who are with him — wearied, and pursuing,
\v 5 and he said to the men of Succoth, 'Give, I pray you, cakes of bread to the people who are at my feet, for they are wearied, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of Midian.'
\v 6 And the heads of Succoth say, 'Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we give to your host bread?'
\v 7 And Gideon said, 'Therefore — in Yahweh's giving Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand — I have threshed your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and with the threshing instruments.'
\v 8 And he went up there to Penuel, and spoke unto them thus; and the men of Penuel answer him as the men of Succoth answered.
\v 9 And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, 'In my turning back in peace, I break down this tower.'
\v 10 And Zebah and Zalmunna are in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand, all who are left of all the camp of the sons of the east; and those falling are a hundred and twenty thousand men, drawing sword.
\v 11 And Gideon went up the way of those who tabernacle in tents, on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smiteth the camp, and the camp was confident;
\v 12 and Zebab and Zalmunna flee, and he pursueth after them, and captureth the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and all the camp he had caused to tremble.
\v 13 And Gideon son of Joash turneth back from the battle, at the going up of the sun,
\v 14 and captureth a young man of the men of Succoth, and asketh him, and he describeth unto him the heads of Succoth, and its elders — seventy and seven men.
\v 15 And he came in unto the men of Succoth, and said, 'Lo Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom you reproached me, saying, Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand that we give to your men who are wearied bread?'
\v 16 And he took the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness, and the threshing instruments, and teacheth by them the men of Succoth,
\v 17 and the tower of Penuel he had broken down, and slaid the men of the city.
\v 18 And he said unto Zebah and unto Zalmunna, 'How — the men whom you slew in Tabor?' and they say, 'As you — so they, one — as the form of the king's sons.'
\v 19 And he said, 'My brethren — sons of my mother — they; Yahweh lived, if you had kept them alive — I had not killed you.'
\v 20 And he said to Jether his first-born, 'Rise, slay them;' and the young man had not drawn his sword, for he had been afraid, for he is yet a youth.
\v 21 And Zebah said — also Zalmunna — 'Rise you, and fall upon us; for as the man — his might;' and Gideon riseth, and slaid Zebah and Zalmunna, and took their round ornaments which are on the necks of their camels.
\v 22 And the men of Israel say unto Gideon, 'Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son, for you hast saved us from the hand of Midian.'
\v 23 And Gideon said unto them, 'I do not rule over you, nor did my son rule over you; Yahweh did rule over you.'
\v 24 And Gideon said unto them, 'Let me ask of you a petition, and give you to me each the ring of his prey, for they have rings of gold, for they are Ishmaelites.'
\v 25 And they say, 'We certainly give;' and they spread out the garment, and cast thither each the ring of his prey;
\v 26 and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, apart from the round ornaments, and the drops, and the purple garments, which are on the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains which are on the necks of their camels,
\v 27 and Gideon made it into an ephod, and setteth it up in his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare.
\v 28 And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel, and have not added to lift up their head; and the land rested forty years in the days of Gideon.
\v 29 And Jerubbaal son of Joash went and dwelleth in his own house,
\v 30 and to Gideon there have been seventy sons, coming out of his loin, for he had many wives;
\v 31 and his concubine, who is in Shechem, had born to him — even she — a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech.
\v 32 And Gideon son of Joash dieth, in a good old age, and is buried in the burying-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-Ezrite.
\v 33 And it came to pass, when Gideon is dead, that the sons of Israel turn back and go a-whoring after the Baalim, and set over them Baal-Berith for a god;
\v 34 and the sons of Israel have not remembered Yahweh their God, who is delivering them out of the hand of all their enemies round about,
\v 35 neither have they done kindness with the house of Jerubbaal — Gideon — according to all the good which he did with Israel.
\c 9
\v 1 and Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, unto his mother's brethren, and spoke unto them, and unto all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
\v 2 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the masters of Shechem, Which is good for you — the ruling over you of seventy men (all the sons of Jerubbaal), or the ruling over you of one man? — and you have remembered that I am your bone and your flesh.'
\v 3 And his mother's brethren speak concerning him, in the ears of all the masters of Shechem, all these words, and their heart inclineth after Abimelech, for they said, 'He is our brother;'
\v 4 and they give to him seventy silverings out of the house of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech hireth with them men, vain and unstable, and they go after him;
\v 5 and he went into the house of his father at Ophrah, and slaid his brethren, sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone; and Jotham, youngest son of Jerubbaal, is left, for he was hidden.
\v 6 And all the masters of Shechem are gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and come and cause Abimelech to reign for king at the oak of the camp which is in Shechem;
\v 7 and they declare it to Jotham, and he went and standeth on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifteth up his voice, and called, and said to them, 'Hearken unto me, O masters of Shechem, and God did hearken unto you:
\v 8 'The trees have diligently gone to anoint over them a king, and they say to the olive, Reign you over us.
\v 9 And the olive said to them, Have I ceased from my fatness, by which they honour gods and men, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?
\v 10 And the trees say to the fig, Come you, reign over us.
\v 11 And the fig said to them, Have I ceased from my sweetness, and my good increase, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?
\v 12 'And the trees say to the vine, Come you, reign over us.
\v 13 And the vine said to them, Have I ceased from my new wine, which is rejoicing gods and men, that I have gone to stagger over the trees?
\v 14 And all the trees say unto the bramble, Come you, reign over us.
\v 15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth you are anointing me for king over you, come, take refuge in my shadow; and if not — fire came out from the bramble, and devoureth the cedars of Lebanon.
\v 16 And, now, if in truth and in sincerity you have acted, when you make Abimelech king; and if you have done good with Jerubbaal, and with his house; and if according to the deed of his hands you have done to him — 
\v 17 because my father had fought for you, and did cast away his life from him, and deliver you from the hand of Midian;
\v 18 and you have risen against the house of my father to-day, and slay his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and cause Abimelech son of his handmaid to reign over the masters of Shechem, because he is your brother — 
\v 19 yea, if in truth and in sincerity you have acted with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice you in Abimelech, and he did rejoice — even he — in you;
\v 20 and if not — fire came out from Abimelech and devoureth the masters of Shechem and the house of Millo, and fire came out from the masters of Shechem and from the house of Millo, and devoureth Abimelech.'
\v 21 And Jotham hasteth, and fleeth, and went to Beer, and dwelleth there, from the face of Abimelech his brother.
\v 22 And Abimelech is prince over Israel three years,
\v 23 and God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the masters of Shechem, and the masters of Shechem deal treacherously with Abimelech,
\v 24 for the coming in of the violence to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, and of their blood to place it on Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and on the masters of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
\v 25 And the masters of Shechem set for him ambushes on the top of the hills, and rob every one who passeth over by them in the way, and it is declared to Abimelech.
\v 26 And Gaal son of Ebed came — also his brethren — and they pass over into Shechem, and the masters of Shechem trust in him,
\v 27 and go out into the field, and gather their vineyards, and tread, and make praises, and go into the house of their god, and eat and drink, and revile Abimelech.
\v 28 And Gaal son of Ebed said, 'Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we serve him? is he not son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his commander? Serve you the men of Hamor father of Shechem, and wherefore do we serve him — we?
\v 29 and oh that this people were in my hand — then I turn Abimelech aside;' and he said to Abimelech, 'Increase your host, and come out.'
\v 30 And Zebul, prince of the city, heareth the words of Gaal son of Ebed, and his anger burneth,
\v 31 and he sent messengers unto Abimelech deceitfully, saying, 'Lo, Gaal son of Ebed and his brethren are coming into Shechem, and behold, they are fortifying the city against you;
\v 32 and, now, rise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lay wait in the field,
\v 33 and it had been, in the morning, about the rising of the sun, you will rise early, and hast pushed against the city; and behold, he and the people who are with him are going out unto you — and you hast done to him as your hand did find.'
\v 34 And Abimelech riseth, and all the people who are with him, by night, and they lay wait against Shechem — four detachments;
\v 35 and Gaal son of Ebed went out, and standeth at the opening of the gate of the city, and Abimelech riseth — also the people who are with him — from the ambush,
\v 36 and Gaal saw the people, and said unto Zebul, 'Lo, people are coming down from the top of the hills;' and Zebul said unto him, 'The shadow of the hills you are seeing like men.'
\v 37 And Gaal addeth yet to speak, and said, 'Lo, people are coming down from the high part of the land, and another detachment is coming by the way of the oak of Meonenim.'
\v 38 And Zebul said unto him, 'Where is now your mouth, in that you sayest, Who is Abimelech that we serve him? is not this the people against which you hast kicked? go out, I pray you now, and fight against it.'
\v 39 And Gaal went out before the masters of Shechem, and fighteth against Abimelech,
\v 40 and Abimelech pursueth him, and he fleeth from his presence, and many fall wounded — unto the opening of the gate.
\v 41 And Abimelech abideth in Arumah, and Zebul threw out Gaal and his brethren from dwelling in Shechem.
\v 42 And it came to pass, on the morrow, that the people go out to the field, and they declare it to Abimelech,
\v 43 and he took the people, and divideth them into three detachments, and laid wait in a field, and looketh, and behold, the people are coming out from the city, and he riseth against them, and smiteth them.
\v 44 And Abimelech and the detachments who are with him have pushed on, and stand at the opening of the gate of the city, and the two detachments have pushed against all who are in the field, and smite them,
\v 45 and Abimelech had fought against the city all that day, and captureth the city, and the people who are in it he had killed, and he breaketh down the city, and soweth it with salt.
\v 46 And all the masters of the tower of Shechem hear, and go in unto the high place of the house of the god Berith,
\v 47 and it is declared to Abimelech that all the masters of the tower of Shechem have gathered themselves together,
\v 48 and Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people who are with him, and Abimelech took the great axe in his hand, and cutteth off a bough of the trees, and lifteth it up, and setteth it on his shoulder, and said unto the people who are with him, 'What you have seen I have done — haste, do you like it.'
\v 49 And all the people also cut down each one his bough, and go after Abimelech, and set them at the high place, and burn by these the high place with fire, and also all the men of the tower of Shechem die, about a thousand men and women.
\v 50 And Abimelech went unto Thebez, and encampeth against Thebez, and captureth it,
\v 51 and a strong tower had been in the middle of the city, and thither flee do all the men and the women, and all the masters of the city, and they shut it behind them, and go up on the roof of the tower.
\v 52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fighteth against it, and draweth nigh unto the opening of the tower to burn it with fire,
\v 53 and a certain woman did cast a piece of a rider on the head of Abimelech, and breaketh his skull,
\v 54 and he called hastily unto the young man bearing his weapons, and said to him, 'Draw your sword, and you hast put me to death, lest they say of me — A woman slew him;' and his young man pierced him through, and he dieth.
\v 55 And the men of Israel see that Abimelech is dead, and go each one to his place;
\v 56 and God turneth back the evil of Abimelech which he did to his father to slay his seventy brethren;
\v 57 and all the evil of the men of Shechem had God turned back on their head, and come unto them did the cursing of Jotham son of Jerubbaal.
\c 10
\v 1 And there riseth after Abimelech, to save Israel, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he is dwelling in Shamir, in the hill-country of Ephraim,
\v 2 and he judgeth Israel twenty and three years, and he dieth, and is buried in Shamir.
\v 3 And there riseth after him Jair the Gileadite, and he judgeth Israel twenty and two years,
\v 4 and he had thirty sons riding on thirty ass-colts, and they have thirty cities, (they call them Havoth-Jair unto this day), which are in the land of Gilead;
\v 5 and Jair dieth, and is buried in Kamon.
\v 6 And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and serve the Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the Bene-Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsake Yahweh, and have not served Him;
\v 7 and the anger of Yahweh burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the Bene-Ammon,
\v 8 and they crush and oppress the sons of Israel in that year — eighteen years all the sons of Israel who are beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, which is in Gilead.
\v 9 And the Bene-Ammon pass over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, and Israel had great distress.
\v 10 And the sons of Israel cry unto Yahweh, saying, 'We have sinned against Thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and serve the Baalim.'
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto the sons of Israel, 'Have I not saved you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorite, from the Bene-Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\v 12 And the Zidonians, and Amalek, and Maon have oppressed you, and you cry unto Me, and I save you out of their hand;
\v 13 and you — you have forsaken Me, and serve other gods, therefore I add not to save you.
\v 14 Go and cry unto the gods on which you have fixed; they — they save you in the time of your adversity.'
\v 15 And the sons of Israel say unto Yahweh, 'We have sinned, do You to us according to all that is good in Thine eyes; only deliver us, we pray Thee, this day.'
\v 16 And they turn aside the gods of the stranger out of their middle, and serve Yahweh, and His soul is grieved with the misery of Israel.
\v 17 And the Bene-Ammon are called together, and encamp in Gilead, and the sons of Israel are gathered together, and encamp in Mizpah.
\v 18 And the people — heads of Gilead — say one unto another, 'Who is the man that did begin to fight against the Bene-Ammon? he is for head to all inhabitants of Gilead.'
\c 11
\v 1 And Jephthah the Gileadite had been a mighty man of valour, and he is son of a woman, a harlot; and Gilead begetteth Jephthah,
\v 2 and the wife of Gilead beareth to him sons, and the wife's sons grow up and cast out Jephthah, and say to him, 'You will not inherit in the house of our father; for son of another woman are you.'
\v 3 And Jephthah fleeth from the face of his brethren, and dwelleth in the land of Tob; and vain men gather themselves together unto Jephthah, and they go out with him.
\v 4 And it came to pass, after a time, that the Bene-Ammon fight with Israel,
\v 5 and it came to pass, when the Bene-Ammon have fought with Israel, that the elders of Gilead go to take Jephthah from the land of Tob;
\v 6 and they say unto Jephthah, 'Come, and you hast been to us for captain, and we fight against the Bene-Ammon.'
\v 7 And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, 'Have not you hated me? and you cast me out from the house of my father, and wherefore have you come unto me now when you are in distress?'
\v 8 and the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah, 'Therefore, now, we have turned back unto you; and you hast gone with us, and fought against the Bene-Ammon, and you hast been to us for head — to all the inhabitants of Gilead.'
\v 9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, 'If you are taking me back to fight against the Bene-Ammon, and Yahweh had given them before me — I, am I to you for a head?'
\v 10 And the elders of Gilead say unto Jephthah, 'Yahweh is hearkening between us — if according to your word we do not so.'
\v 11 And Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people set him over them for head and for captain, and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpeh.
\v 12 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the Bene-Ammon, saying, 'What — to me and to you, that you hast come in unto me, to fight in my land.'
\v 13 And the king of the Bene-Ammon said unto the messengers of Jephthah, 'Because Israel took my land in his coming up out of Egypt, from Arnon, and unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan; and now, restore them in peace.'
\v 14 And Jephthah addeth yet and sent messengers unto the king of the Bene-Ammon,
\v 15 and said to him, 'Thus said Jephthah, Israel took not the land of Moab, and the land of the Bene-Ammon,
\v 16 for in their coming up out of Egypt, Israel went in the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came in to Kadesh,
\v 17 and Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me pass over, I pray you, through your land, and the king of Edom hearkened not; and also unto the king of Moab had Israel sent, and he had not been willing; and Israel abideth in Kadesh,
\v 18 and he went through the wilderness, and compasseth the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came in at the rising of the sun of the land of Moab, and they encamp beyond Arnon, and have not come into the border of Moab, for Arnon is the border of Moab.
\v 19 'And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon, king of the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass over, we pray you, through your land, unto my place,
\v 20 and Sihon had not trusted Israel to pass over through his border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and they encamp in Jahaz, and fight with Israel;
\v 21 and Yahweh, God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smite them, and Israel possesseth all the land of the Amorite, the inhabitant of that land,
\v 22 and they possess all the border of the Amorite from Arnon, and unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness, and unto the Jordan.
\v 23 'And now, Yahweh, God of Israel, had dispossessed the Amorite from the presence of His people Israel, and you wouldest possess it!
\v 24 That which Chemosh your god caused you to possess — will you not possess it? and all that which Yahweh our God had dispossessed from our presence, — it we do possess.
\v 25 And now, are you at all better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he at all strive with Israel? did he at all fight against them?
\v 26 In Israel's dwelling in Heshbon and in its towns, and in Aroer and in its towns, and in all the cities which are by the sides of Arnon three hundred years — and wherefore have you not delivered them in that time?
\v 27 And I — I have not sinned against you, and you are doing with me evil — to fight against me. Yahweh, the Judge, did judge to-day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.'
\v 28 And the king of the Bene-Ammon had not hearkened unto the words of Jephthah which he sent unto him,
\v 29 and the Spirit of Yahweh is on Jephthah, and he passeth over Gilead and Manasseh, and passeth over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he had passed over to the Bene-Ammon.
\v 30 And Jephthah voweth a vow to Yahweh, and said, 'If You will at all give the Bene-Ammon into my hand — 
\v 31 then it had been, that which at all came out from the doors of my house to meet me in my turning back in peace from the Bene-Ammon — it had been to Yahweh, or I have offered up for it — a burnt-offering.'
\v 32 And Jephthah passeth over unto the Bene-Ammon to fight against them, and Yahweh gave them into his hand,
\v 33 and he smiteth them from Aroer, and unto your going in to Minnith, twenty cities, and unto the meadow of the vineyards — a very great smiting; and the Bene-Ammon are humbled at the presence of the sons of Israel.
\v 34 And Jephthah came into Mizpeh, unto his house, and behold, his daughter is coming out to meet him with timbrels, and with choruses, and save her alone, he had none, son or daughter.
\v 35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rendeth his garments, and said, 'Alas, my daughter, you hast caused me greatly to bend, and you hast been among those troubling me; and I — I have opened my mouth unto Yahweh, and I am not able to turn back.'
\v 36 And she said unto him, 'My father — you hast opened your mouth unto Yahweh, do to me as it had gone out from your mouth, after that Yahweh had done for you vengeance on yours enemies, on the Bene-Ammon.'
\v 37 And she said unto her father, 'Let this thing be done to me; desist from me two months, and I go on, and have gone down on the hills, and I weep for my virginity — I and my friends.'
\v 38 And he said, 'Go;' and he sent her away two months, and she went, she and her friends, and she weepeth for her virginity on the hills;
\v 39 and it came to pass at the end of two months that she turneth back unto her father, and he did to her his vow which he had vowed, and she knew not a man; and it is a statute in Israel:
\v 40 from time to time the daughters of Israel go to talk to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in a year.
\c 12
\v 1 And the men of Ephraim are called together, and pass over northward, and say to Jephthah, 'Wherefore has you passed over to fight against the Bene-Ammon, and on us hast not called to go with you? your house we burn over you with fire.'
\v 2 And Jephthah said unto them, 'A man of great strife I have been (I and my people) with the Bene-Ammon, and I call you, and you have not saved me out of their hand,
\v 3 and I see that you are not a saviour, and I put my life in my hand, and pass over unto the Bene-Ammon, and Yahweh gave them into my hand — and why have you come up unto me this day to fight against me?'
\v 4 And Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead, and fighteth with Ephraim, and the men of Gilead smite Ephraim, because they said, 'Fugitives of Ephraim are you Gileadites, in the middle of Ephraim — in the middle of Manasseh.'
\v 5 And Gilead captureth the passages of the Jordan to Ephraim, and it had been, when any of the fugitives of Ephraim say, 'Let me pass over,' and the men of Gilead say to him, 'An Ephramite you?' and he said, 'No;'
\v 6 that they say to him, 'Say, I pray you, Shibboleth;' and he said, 'Sibboleth,' and is not prepared to speak right — and they seize him, and slaughter him at the passages of the Jordan, and there fall at that time, of Ephraim, forty and two chiefs.
\v 7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years, and Jephthah the Gileadite dieth, and is buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
\v 8 And after him Ibzan of Beth-Lehem judgeth Israel,
\v 9 and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters, he had sent without and thirty daughters had brought in to his sons from without; and he judgeth Israel seven years.
\v 10 And Ibzan dieth, and is buried in Beth-Lehem.
\v 11 And after him Elon the Zebulunite judgeth Israel, and he judgeth Israel ten years,
\v 12 and Elon the Zebulunite dieth, and is buried in Aijalon, in the land of Zebulun.
\v 13 And after him, Abdon son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, judgeth Israel,
\v 14 and he had forty sons, and thirty grandsons, riding on seventy ass-colts, and he judgeth Israel eight years.
\v 15 And Abdon son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, dieth, and is buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekite.
\c 13
\v 1 And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
\v 2 And there is a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danite, and his name is Manoah, his wife is barren, and had not borne;
\v 3 and a messenger of Yahweh appeareth unto the woman, and said unto her, 'Lo, I pray you, you are barren, and hast not borne; when you hast conceived, then you hast borne a son.
\v 4 And, now, take heed, I pray you, and do not drink wine, and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing,
\v 5 for, behold, you are conceiving and bearing a son, and a razor did not go up on his head, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the womb, and he did begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.'
\v 6 And the woman came and spoke to her husband, saying, 'A man of God had come unto me, and his appearance is as the appearance of a messenger of God, very fearful, and I have not asked him whence he is, and his name he had not declared to me;
\v 7 and he said to me, Lo, you are pregnant, and bearing a son, and now do not drink wine and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the womb till the day of his death.'
\v 8 And Manoah made entreaty unto Yahweh, and said, 'O, my Lord, the man of God whom You did send, let him come in, I pray you, again unto us, and direct us what we do to the youth who is born.'
\v 9 And God hearkeneth to the voice of Manoah, and the messenger of God came again unto the woman, and she is sitting in a field, and Manoah her husband is not with her,
\v 10 and the woman hasteth, and runneth, and declareth to her husband, and said unto him, 'Lo, he had appeared unto me — the man who came on that day unto me.'
\v 11 And Manoah riseth, and went after his wife, and came unto the man, and said to him, 'Art you the man who spake unto the woman?' and he said, 'I am.'
\v 12 And Manoah said, 'Now let your words come to pass; what is the custom of the youth — and his work?'
\v 13 And the messenger of Yahweh said unto Manoah, 'Of all that I said unto the woman let her take heed;
\v 14 of anything which came out from the wine-vine she did not eat, and wine and strong drink she did not drink, and any unclean thing she did not eat; all that I have commanded her she did observe.'
\v 15 And Manoah said unto the messenger of Yahweh, 'Let us detain you, we pray you, and prepare before you a kid of the goats.'
\v 16 And the messenger of Yahweh said unto Manoah, 'If you detain me — I do not eat of your bread; and if you prepare a burnt-offering — to Yahweh you will offer it;' for Manoah had not known that He is a messenger of Yahweh.
\v 17 And Manoah said unto the messenger of Yahweh, 'What is your name? when your words come to pass, then we have honoured you.'
\v 18 And the messenger of Yahweh said to him, 'Why is this — you will ask for My name? — and it is Wonderful.'
\v 19 And Manoah took the kid of the goats, and the present, and offereth on the rock to Yahweh, and He is doing wonderfully, and Manoah and his wife are looking on,
\v 20 and it came to pass, in the going up of the flame from off the altar toward the heavens, that the messenger of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar, and Manoah and his wife are looking on, and they fall on their faces to the earth,
\v 21 and the messenger of Yahweh had not added again to appear unto Manoah, and unto his wife, then had Manoah known that He is a messenger of Yahweh.
\v 22 And Manoah said unto his wife, 'We certainly die, for we have seen God.'
\v 23 And his wife said to him, 'If Yahweh were desirous to put us to death, He had not received from our hands burnt-offering and present, nor showed us all these things, nor as at this time caused us to hear anything like this.'
\v 24 And the woman beareth a son, and called his name Samson, and the youth groweth, and Yahweh did bless him,
\v 25 and the Spirit of Yahweh beginneth to move him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
\c 14
\v 1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines,
\v 2 and came up and declareth to his father, and to his mother, and said, 'A woman I have seen in Timnath, of the daughters of the Philistines; and now, take her for me for a wife.'
\v 3 And his father said to him — also his mother, 'Is there not among the daughters of your brethren, and among all my people, a woman, that you are going to take a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?' and Samson said unto his father, 'Take her for me, for she is right in mine eyes.'
\v 4 And his father and his mother have not known that from Yahweh it is, that a meeting he is seeking of the Philistines; and at that time the Philistines are ruling over Israel.
\v 5 And Samson went down — also his father and his mother, to Timnath, and they come unto the vineyards of Timnath, and behold, a lion's whelp roareth at meeting him,
\v 6 and the Spirit of Yahweh prospereth over him, and he rendeth it as the rending of a kid, and there is nothing in his hand, and he had not declared to his father and to his mother that which he had done.
\v 7 And he went down and spoke to the woman, and she is right in the eyes of Samson;
\v 8 and he turneth back after some days to take her, and turneth aside to see the carcase of the lion, and behold, a company of bees are in the body of the lion — and honey.
\v 9 And he took it down on to his hands, and went on, going and eating; and he went unto his father, and unto his mother, and gave to them, and they eat, and he had not declared to them that from the body of the lion he took down the honey.
\v 10 And his father went down unto the woman, and Samson made there a banquet, for so the young men do;
\v 11 and it came to pass when they see him, that they take thirty companions, and they are with him.
\v 12 And Samson said to them, 'Let me, I pray you, put forth to you a riddle; if you certainly declare it to me in the seven days of the banquet, and have found it out, then I have given to you thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of garments;
\v 13 and if you are not able to declare it to me, then you have given to me thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of garments.' And they say to him, 'Put forth your riddle, and we hear it!'
\v 14 And he said to them: 'Out of the eater came forth meat, And out of the strong came forth sweetness;' and they were not able to declare the riddle in three days.
\v 15 And it came to pass, on the seventh day, that they say to Samson's wife, 'Entice your husband, that he declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and the house of your father with fire; to possess us have you called for us? is it not?'
\v 16 And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and said, 'You hast only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle you hast put forth to the sons of my people — and to me you hast not declared it;' and he said to her, 'Lo, to my father and to my mother I have not declared it — and to you I declare it!'
\v 17 And she weepeth for it the seven days in which their banquet had been, and it came to pass on the seventh day that he declareth it to her, for she had distressed him; and she declareth the riddle to the sons of her people.
\v 18 And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day, before the sun went in: — 'What is sweeter than honey? And what stronger than a lion?' And he said to them: 'Unless you had ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.'
\v 19 And the Spirit of Yahweh prospereth over him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smiteth of them thirty men, and took their armour, and gave the changes to those declaring the riddle; and his anger burneth, and he went up to the house of his father;
\v 20 and Samson's wife became his companion's, who is his friend.
\c 15
\v 1 And it came to pass, after some days, in the days of wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid of the goats, and said, 'I go in unto my wife, to the inner chamber;' and her father had not permitted him to go in,
\v 2 and her father said, I certainly said, that you did certainly hate her, and I give her to your companion; is not her sister — the young one — better than she? Let her be, I pray you, to you, instead of her.'
\v 3 And Samson said of them, 'I am more innocent this time than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.'
\v 4 And Samson went and catcheth three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch between the two tails, in the middle,
\v 5 and kindleth fire in the torches, and sent them out into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth it from heap even unto standing corn, even unto vineyard — olive-yard.
\v 6 And the Philistines say, 'Who had done this?' And they say, 'Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken away his wife, and gave her to his companion;' and the Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.
\v 7 And Samson said to them, 'Yough you do thus, nevertheless I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!'
\v 8 And he smiteth them hip and thigh — a great smiting, and went down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam.
\v 9 And the Philistines go up, and encamp in Judah, and are spread out in Lehi,
\v 10 and the men of Judah say, 'Why have you come up against us?' and they say, 'To bind Samson we have come up, to do to him as he had done to us.'
\v 11 And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of the rock Etam, and say to Samson, 'Hast you now known that the Philistines are rulers over us? and what is this you hast done to us?' And he said to them, 'As they did to me, so I did to them.'
\v 12 And they say to him, 'To bind you we have come down — to give you into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson said to them, 'Swear to me, lest you fall upon me yourselves.'
\v 13 And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind you, and have given you into their hand, and we certainly do not put you to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands, new ones, and bring him up from the rock.
\v 14 He had come unto Lehi — and the Philistines have shouted at meeting him — and the Spirit of Yahweh prospereth over him, and the thick bands which are on his arms are as flax which they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his hands,
\v 15 and he finds a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth forth his hand and took it, and smiteth with it — a thousand men.
\v 16 And Samson said, 'With a jaw-bone of the ass — an ass upon asses — with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a thousand men.'
\v 17 And it came to pass when he finisheth speaking, that he threw away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-Lehi;
\v 18 and he thirsteth exceedingly, and called unto Yahweh, and said, 'You — You hast given by the hand of Your servant this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'
\v 19 And God cleaveth the hollow place which is in Lehi, and waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit came back, and he reviveth; therefore had one called its name 'The fountain of him who is calling,' which is in Lehi unto this day.
\v 20 And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
\c 16
\v 1 And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a woman, a harlot, and went in unto her;
\v 2 it is told to the Gazathites, saying, 'Samson had come in hither;' and they go round and lay wait for him all the night at the gate of the city, and keep themselves silent all the night, saying, 'Till the light of the morning — then we have killed him.'
\v 3 And Samson lieth down till the middle of the night, and riseth in the middle of the night, and laid hold on the doors of the gate of the city, and on the two side posts, and removeth them with the bar, and putteth on his shoulders, and took them up unto the top of the hill, which is on the front of Hebron.
\v 4 And it came to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in the valley of Sorek, and her name is Delilah,
\v 5 and the princes of the Philistines come up unto her, and say to her, 'Entice him, and see wherein his great power is, and wherein we are able for him — and we have bound him to afflict him, and we — we give to you, each one, eleven hundred silverlings.'
\v 6 And Delilah said unto Samson, 'Declare, I pray you, to me, wherein your great power is, and wherewith you are bound, to afflict you.'
\v 7 And Samson said unto her, 'If they bind me with seven green withs which have not been dried, then I have been weak, and have been as one of the human race.'
\v 8 And the princes of the Philistines bring up to her seven green withs which have not been dried, and she bindeth him with them.
\v 9 And the ambush is abiding with her in an inner chamber, and she said unto him, 'Philistines are upon you, Samson;' and he breaketh the withs as a thread of tow is broken in its smelling fire, and his power had not been known.
\v 10 And Delilah said unto Samson, 'Lo, you hast played upon me, and speakest unto me lies; now, declare, I pray you, to me, wherewith you are bound.'
\v 11 And he said unto her, 'If they certainly bind me with thick bands, new ones, by which work had not been done, then I have been weak, and have been as one of the human race.'
\v 12 And Delilah took thick bands, new ones, and bindeth him with them, and said unto him, 'Philistines are upon you, Samson;' and the ambush is abiding in an inner chamber, and he breaketh them from off his arms as a thread.
\v 13 And Delilah said unto Samson, 'Hitherto you hast played upon me, and will speak unto me lies; declare to me wherewith you are bound.' And he said unto her, 'If you weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.'
\v 14 And she fixeth it with the pin, and said unto him, 'Philistines are upon you, Samson;' and he awaketh out of his sleep, and journeyeth with the pin of the weaving machine, and with the web.
\v 15 And she said unto him, 'How will you say, I have loved you, and your heart is not with me? these three times you hast played upon me, and hast not declared to me wherein your great power is.'
\v 16 And it came to pass, because she distressed him with her words all the days, and did urge him, and his soul is grieved to death,
\v 17 that he declareth to her all his heart, and said to her, 'A razor had not gone up on my head, for a Nazarite to God I am from the womb of my mother; if I have been shaven, then had my power turned aside from me, and I have been weak, and have been as any of the human race.'
\v 18 And Delilah saw that he had declared to her all his heart, and she sent and called for the princes of the Philistines, saying, 'Come up this time, for he had declared to me all his heart;' and the princes of the Philistines have come up unto her, and bring up the money in their hand.
\v 19 and she made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man, and shaveth the seven locks of his head, and beginneth to afflict him, and his power turneth aside from off him;
\v 20 and she said, 'Philistines are upon you, Samson;' and he awaketh out of his sleep, and said, 'I go out as time by time, and shake myself;' and he had not known that Yahweh had turned aside from off him.
\v 21 And the Philistines seize him, and pick out his eyes, and bring him down to Gaza, and bind him with two brazen fetters; and he is grinding in the prison-house.
\v 22 And the hair of his head beginneth to shoot up, when he had been shaven,
\v 23 and the princes of the Philistines have been gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; and they say, 'Our god had given into our hand Samson our enemy.'
\v 24 And the people see him, and praise their god, for they said, 'Our god had given in our hand our enemy, and he who is laying waste our land, and who multiplied our wounded.'
\v 25 And it came to pass, when their heart is glad, that they say, 'Call for Samson, and he did play before us;' and they call for Samson out of the prison-house, and he plaid before them, and they cause him to stand between the pillars.
\v 26 And Samson said unto the young man who is keeping hold on his hand, 'Let me alone, and let me feel the pillars on which the house is established, and I lean upon them.'
\v 27 And the house had been full of men and of women, and thither are all the princes of the Philistines, and on the roof are about three thousand men and women, who are looking on the playing of Samson.
\v 28 And Samson called unto Yahweh, and said, 'Lord Yahweh, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this time, O God; and I am avenged — vengeance at once — because of my two eyes, on the Philistines.'
\v 29 And Samson turneth aside to the two middle pillars, on which the house is established, and on which it is supported, to the one with his right hand, and one with his left;
\v 30 and Samson said, 'Let me die with the Philistines,' and he inclineth himself powerfully, and the house falleth on the princes, and on all the people who are in it, and the dead whom he had put to death in his death are more than those whom he put to death in his life.
\v 31 And his brethren come down, and all the house of his father, and lift him up, and bring him up, and bury him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the burying-place of Manoah his father; and he had judged Israel twenty years.
\c 17
\v 1 And there is a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name is Micah,
\v 2 and he said to his mother, 'The eleven hundred silverlings which have been taken of yours, and of which you hast sworn, and also spoken in mine ears; behold, the silver is with me, I have taken it;' and his mother said, 'Blessed is my son of Yahweh.'
\v 3 And he gave back the eleven hundred silverlings to his mother, and his mother said, 'I had certainly sanctified the silver to Yahweh, from my hand, for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; and now, I give it back to you.'
\v 4 And he gave back the money to his mother, and his mother took two hundred silverlings, and gave them to a refiner, and he made them a graven image, and a molten image, and it is in the house of Micah.
\v 5 As to the man Micah, he had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrateth the hand of one of his sons, and he is to him for a priest;
\v 6 in those days there is no king in Israel, each that which is right in his own eyes did.
\v 7 And there is a young man of Beth-Lehem-Judah, of the family of Judah, and he is a Levite, and he is a sojourner there.
\v 8 And the man went out of the city, out of Beth-Lehem-Judah, to sojourn where he did find, and came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, to work his way.
\v 9 And Micah said to him, 'Whence comest you?' and he said unto him, 'A Levite am I, of Beth-Lehem-Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I do find.'
\v 10 And Micah said to him, 'Dwell with me, and be to me for a father and for a priest, and I give to you ten silverlings for the days, and a suit of garments, and your sustenance;' and the Levite went in.
\v 11 And the Levite is willing to dwell with the man, and the young man is to him as one of his sons.
\v 12 And Micah consecrateth the hand of the Levite, and the young man is to him for a priest, and he is in the house of Micah,
\v 13 and Micah said, 'Now I have known that Yahweh did good to me, for the Levite had been to me for a priest.'
\c 18
\v 1 In those days there is no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of the Danite is seeking for itself an inheritance to inhabit, for that had not fallen to it unto that day in the middle of the tribes of Israel by inheritance.
\v 2 And the sons of Dan send, out of their family, five men of them, men, sons of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to traverse the land, and to search it, and they say unto them, 'Go, search the land;' and they come into the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodge there.
\v 3 They are with the household of Micah, and they have discerned the voice of the young man, the Levite, and turn aside there, and say to him, 'Who had brought you hither? and what are you doing in this place? and what to you here?'
\v 4 And he said unto them, 'Thus and thus had Micah done to me; and he hireth me, and I am to him for a priest.'
\v 5 And they say to him, 'Ask, we pray you, at God, and we know whether our way is prosperous on which we are going.'
\v 6 And the priest said to them, 'Go in peace; over-against Yahweh is your way in which you go.'
\v 7 And the five men go, and come in to Laish, and see the people which is in its middle, dwelling confidently, according to the custom of Zidonians, quiet and confident; and there is none putting to shame in the land in any thing, possessing restraint, and they are far off from the Zidonians, and have no word with any man.
\v 8 And they come in unto their brethren, at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren say to them, 'What — you?'
\v 9 And they say, 'Rise, and we go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, very good; and you are keeping silent! be not slothful to go — to enter to possess the land.
\v 10 When you go, you come in unto a people confident, and the land is large on both hands, for God had given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything which is in the land.'
\v 11 And there journey there, of the family of the Danite, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
\v 12 And they go up and encamp in Kirjath-Jearim, in Judah, therefore they have called that place, 'Camp of Dan,' till this day; behold, behind Kirjath-Jearim.
\v 13 And they pass over there to the hill-country of Ephraim, and come in unto the house of Micah.
\v 14 And the five men, those going to traverse the land of Laish, answer and say unto their brethren, 'Have you known that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and graven image, and molten image? and now, know what you do.'
\v 15 And they turn aside thither, and come in unto the house of the young man the Levite, the house of Micah, and ask of him of welfare, — 
\v 16 (and the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who are of the sons of Dan, are standing at the opening of the gate), — 
\v 17 yea, the five men, those going to traverse the land, go up — they have come in thither — they have taken the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image — and the priest is standing at the opening of the gate, and the six hundred men who are girded with weapons of war — 
\v 18 yea, these have entered the house of Micah, and take the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest said unto them, 'What are you doing?'
\v 19 and they say to him, 'Keep silent, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us for a father and for a priest: is it better your being a priest to the house of one man, or your being priest to a tribe and to a family in Israel?'
\v 20 And the heart of the priest is glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went into the middle of the people,
\v 21 and they turn and go, and put the infants, and the cattle, and the baggage, before them.
\v 22 They have been far off from the house of Micah — and the men who are in the houses which are near the house of Micah have been called together, and overtake the sons of Dan,
\v 23 and call unto the sons of Dan, and they turn round their faces, and say to Micah, 'What — to you that you hast been called together?'
\v 24 And he said, 'My gods which I made you have taken, and the priest, and you go; and what to me more? and what is this you say unto me, What — to you!'
\v 25 And the sons of Dan say unto him, 'Let not your voice be heard with us, lest men bitter in soul fall upon you, and you hast gathered your life, and the life of your household;'
\v 26 and the sons of Dan go on their way, and Micah saw that they are stronger than he, and turneth, and went back unto his house.
\v 27 And they have taken that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and come in against Laish, against a people quiet and confident, and smite them by the mouth of the sword, and the city have burnt with fire,
\v 28 and there is no deliverer, for it is far off from Zidon, and they have no word with any man, and it is in the valley which is by Beth-Rehob; and they build the city, and dwell in it,
\v 29 and call the name of the city Dan, by the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and yet Laish is the name of the city at the first.
\v 30 And the sons of Dan raise up for themselves the graven image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his sons have been priests to the tribe of the Danite, till the day of the removal of the people of the land.
\v 31 And they appoint for them the graven image of Micah, which he had made, all the days of the house of God being in Shiloh.
\c 19
\v 1 And it came to pass, in those days, when there is no king in Israel, that there is a man a Levite, a sojourner in the sides of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he took to him a wife, a concubine, out of Beth-Lehem-Judah;
\v 2 and commit whoredom against him did his concubine, and she went from him unto the house of her father, unto Beth-Lehem-Judah, and is there days — four months.
\v 3 And her husband riseth and went after her, to speak unto her heart, to bring her back, and his young man is with him, and a couple of asses; and she brought him into the house of her father, and the father of the young woman saw him, and rejoiceth to meet him.
\v 4 And keep hold on him did his father-in-law, father of the young woman, and he abideth with him three days, and they eat and drink, and lodge there.
\v 5 And it came to pass, on the fourth day, that they rise early in the morning, and he riseth to go, and the father of the young woman said unto his son-in-law, 'Support your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you go on.'
\v 6 And they sit and eat both of them together, and drink, and the father of the young woman said unto the man, 'Be willing, I pray you, and lodge all night, and let your heart be glad.'
\v 7 And the man riseth to go, and his father-in-law presseth on him, and he turneth back and lodgeth there.
\v 8 And he riseth early in the morning, on the fifth day, to go, and the father of the young woman said, 'Support, I pray you, your heart;' and they have tarried till the turning of the day, and they eat, both of them.
\v 9 And the man riseth to go, he and his concubine, and his young man, and his father-in-law, father of the young woman, said to him, 'Lo, I pray you, the day had fallen toward evening, lodge all night, I pray you; behold, the declining of the day! lodge here, and let yours heart be glad — and you have risen early to-morrow for your journey, and you hast gone to your tent.'
\v 10 And the man had not been willing to lodge all night, and he riseth, and went, and came in till over-against Jebus (It is Jerusalem), and with him are a couple of asses saddled; and his concubine is with him.
\v 11 They are near Jebus, and the day had gone greatly down, and the young man said unto his lord, 'Come, I pray you, and we turn aside unto this city of the Jebusite, and lodge in it.'
\v 12 And his lord said unto him, 'Let us not turn aside unto the city of a stranger, that is not of the sons of Israel, thither, but we have passed over unto Gibeah.'
\v 13 And he said to his young man, 'Come, and we draw near to one of the places, and have lodged in Gibeah, or in Ramah.'
\v 14 And they pass over, and go on, and the sun went in upon them near Gibeah, which is to Benjamin;
\v 15 and they turn aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah, and he went in and sitteth in a broad place of the city, and there is no man gathering them into the house to lodge.
\v 16 And behold, a man, an aged one, had come from his work from the field in the evening, and the man is of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he is a sojourner in Gibeah, and the men of the place are Benjamites.
\v 17 And he lifteth up his eyes, and saw the man, the traveller, in a broad place of the city, and the aged man said, 'Whither goest you? and whence comest you?'
\v 18 And he said unto him, 'We are passing over from Beth-Lehem-Judah unto the sides of the hill-country of Ephraim — there I am, and I go unto Beth-Lehem-Judah; and to the house of Yahweh I am going, and there is no man gathering me into the house,
\v 19 and both straw and provender are for our asses, and also bread and wine there are for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man with your servants; there is no lack of anything.'
\v 20 And the old man said, 'Peace to you; only, all your lack is on me, only in the broad place lodge not.'
\v 21 And he brought him in to his house, and mixeth food for the asses, and they wash their feet, and eat and drink.
\v 22 They are making their heart glad, and behold, men of the city, men — sons of worthlessness — have gone round about the house, beating on the door, and they speak unto the old man, the master of the house, saying, 'Bring out the man who had come unto yours house, and we know him.'
\v 23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, 'Nay, my brethren, do not evil, I pray you, after that this man had come in unto my house, do not this folly;
\v 24 behold, my daughter, the virgin, and his concubine, let me bring them out, I pray you, and humble you them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes, and to this man do not this foolish thing.'
\v 25 And the men have not been willing to hearken to him, and the man took hold on his concubine, and brought her out unto them without, and they know her, and roll themselves upon her all the night, till the morning, and send her away in the ascending of the dawn;
\v 26 and the woman came in at the turning of the morning, and falleth at the opening of the man's house, where her lord is, till the light.
\v 27 And her lord riseth in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go on his way, and behold, the woman, his concubine, is fallen at the opening of the house, and her hands are on the threshold,
\v 28 and he said unto her, 'Rise, and we go;' and there is none answering, and he took her on the ass, and the man riseth and went to his place,
\v 29 and came in unto his house, and took the knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and cutteth her in pieces to her bones — into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the border of Israel.
\v 30 And it had come to pass, every one who saw had said, 'There had not been — yea, there had not been seen like this, from the day of the coming up of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt till this day; set your heart upon it, take counsel, and speak.'
\c 20
\v 1 And all the sons of Israel go out, and the company is assembled as one man, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, and the land of Gilead, unto Yahweh, at Mizpeh.
\v 2 And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, station themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen drawing sword.
\v 3 And the sons of Benjamin hear that the sons of Israel have gone up to Mizpeh. And the sons of Israel say, 'Speak you, how had this evil been?'
\v 4 And the man, the Levite, husband of the woman who had been murdered, answereth and said, 'Into Gibeah (which is to Benjamin) I have come, I and my concubine, to lodge;
\v 5 and rise against me do the masters of Gibeah — and they go round the house against me by night — me they thought to slay, and my concubine they have humbled, and she dieth;
\v 6 and I lay hold on my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and send her into all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have done wickedness and folly in Israel;
\v 7 behold, you are all sons of Israel; give for you a word and counsel here.'
\v 8 And all the people rise as one man, saying, 'None of us did go to his tent, and none of us did turn aside to his house;
\v 9 and now, this is the thing which we do to Gibeah — against it by lot!
\v 10 and we have taken ten men of a hundred, of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of a myriad, to receive provision for the people, to do, at their coming to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly which it had done in Israel.'
\v 11 And every man of Israel is gathered unto the city, as one man — companions.
\v 12 And the tribes of Israel send men among all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, 'What is this evil which had been among you?
\v 13 And now, give up the men — sons of worthlessness — which are in Gibeah, and we put them to death, and we put away evil from Israel.' And the sons of Benjamin have not been willing to hearken to the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel;
\v 14 and the sons of Benjamin are gathered out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle with the sons of Israel.
\v 15 And the sons of Benjamin number themselves on that day; out of the cities are twenty and six thousand men drawing sword, apart from the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered themselves, seven hundred chosen men;
\v 16 among all this people are seven hundred chosen men, bound of their right hand, each of these slinging with a stone at the hair, and he did not err.
\v 17 And the men of Israel numbered themselves, apart from Benjamin, four hundred thousand men, drawing sword, each of these a man of war.
\v 18 And they rise and go up to Beth-El, and ask of God, and the sons of Israel say, 'Who did go up for us at the commencement to battle with the sons of Benjamin?' and Yahweh said, 'Judah — at the commencement.'
\v 19 And the sons of Israel rise in the morning, and encamp against Gibeah,
\v 20 and the men of Israel go out to battle with Benjamin, and the men of Israel set themselves in array with them, for battle against Gibeah,
\v 21 and the sons of Benjamin come out from Gibeah, and destroy in Israel on that day two and twenty thousand men — to the earth.
\v 22 And the people, the men of Israel, strengthen themselves, and add to set the battle in array in the place where they arranged themselves on the first day.
\v 23 And the sons of Israel go up and weep before Yahweh till the evening, and ask of Yahweh, saying, 'Do I add to draw nigh to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother?' And Yahweh said, 'Go up against him.'
\v 24 And the sons of Israel draw near unto the sons of Benjamin on the second day,
\v 25 and Benjamin came out to meet them from Gibeah on the second day, and destroy among the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men — to the earth; all these are drawing sword.
\v 26 And all the sons of Israel go up, even all the people, and come in to Beth-El, and weep, and sit there before Yahweh, and fast on that day till the evening, and cause to ascend burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.
\v 27 And the sons of Israel ask of Yahweh, — and there is the ark of the covenant of God in those days,
\v 28 and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, is standing before it in those days — saying, 'Do I add again to go out to battle with the sons of Benjamin, my brother, or do I cease?' And Yahweh said, 'Go up, for to-morrow I give him into your hand.'
\v 29 And Israel setteth liers in wait against Gibeah, round about,
\v 30 and the sons of Israel go up against the sons of Benjamin, on the third day, and arrange themselves against Gibeah, as time by time.
\v 31 And the sons of Benjamin come out to meet the people; they have been drawn away out of the city, and begin to smite some of the people — wounded as time by time, in the highways (of which one is going up to Beth-El, and the other to Gibeah in the field), are about thirty men of Israel.
\v 32 And the sons of Benjamin say, 'They are smitten before us as at the beginning;' but the sons of Israel said, 'Let us flee, and draw them away out of the city, unto the highways.'
\v 33 And all the men of Israel have risen from their place, and arrange themselves at Baal-Tamar, and the ambush of Israel is coming forth out of its place, out of the meadow of Gibeah.
\v 34 And they come in over against Gibeah — ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel — and the battle is grievous, and they have not known that the evil is striking against them.
\v 35 And Yahweh smiteth Benjamin before Israel, and the sons of Israel destroy in Benjamin, on that day, twenty and five thousand, and a hundred men; all these are drawing sword.
\v 36 And the sons of Benjamin see that they have been smitten — and the men of Israel give place to Benjamin, for they have trusted unto the ambush which they had set against Gibeah,
\v 37 and the ambush have hasted, and push against Gibeah, and the ambush draweth itself out, and smiteth the whole of the city by the mouth of the sword.
\v 38 And there was the appointed sign to the men of Israel with the ambush — their causing to go up a great volume of smoke from the city.
\v 39 And the men of Israel turn in battle, and Benjamin had begun to smite the wounded among the men of Israel, about thirty men, for they said, 'Surely they are utterly smitten before us, as at the first battle;
\v 40 and the volume had begun to go up from the city — a pillar of smoke — and Benjamin turneth behind, and behold, gone up had the perfection of the city toward the heavens.
\v 41 And the men of Israel have turned, and the men of Benjamin are troubled, for they have seen that the evil had stricken against them — 
\v 42 and they turn before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness, and the battle had followed them; and those who are from the city are destroying them in their middle;
\v 43 they have compassed the Benjamites — they have pursued them — with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah, at the sun-rising.
\v 44 And there fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men — the whole of these are men of valour;
\v 45 and they turn and flee toward the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon; and they glean of them in the highways five thousand men, and follow after them unto Gidom, and smite of them two thousand men.
\v 46 And all those falling of Benjamin are twenty and five thousand men drawing sword, on that day — the whole of these are men of valour;
\v 47 and there turn and flee into the wilderness, unto the rock of Rimmon six hundred men, and they dwell in the rock Rimmon four months.
\v 48 And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of Benjamin, and smite them by the mouth of the sword out of the city, — men unto cattle, unto all that is found; also all the cities which are found they have sent into fire.
\c 21
\v 1 And the men of Israel have sworn in Mizpeh, saying, 'None of us did give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.'
\v 2 And the people come in to Beth-El, and sit there till the evening before God, and lift up their voice, and weep — a great weeping,
\v 3 and say, 'Why, O Yahweh, God of Israel, had this been in Israel — to be lacking to-day, from Israel, one tribe?'
\v 4 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rise early, and build there an altar, and cause to ascend burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
\v 5 And the sons of Israel say, 'Who is he that had not come up in the assembly out of all the tribes of Israel unto Yahweh?' for the great oath had been concerning him who had not come up unto Yahweh to Mizpeh, saying, 'He is surely put to death.'
\v 6 And the sons of Israel repent concerning Benjamin their brother, and say, 'There had been to-day cut off one tribe from Israel,
\v 7 what do we do for them — for those who are left — for wives, and we — we have sworn by Yahweh not to give to them of our daughters for wives?'
\v 8 And they say, 'Who is that one out of the tribes of Israel who had not come up unto Yahweh to Mizpeh?' and behold, none had come in unto the camp from Jabesh-Gilead — unto the assembly.
\v 9 And the people numbered themselves, and behold, there is not there a man of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead.
\v 10 And the company send there twelve thousand men of the sons of valour, and command them, saying, 'Go — and you have smitten the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead by the mouth of the sword, even the women and the infants.
\v 11 And this is the thing which you do; every male, and every woman knowing the lying of a male, you devote.'
\v 12 And they find out of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women, virgins, who have not known man by the lying of a male, and they bring them in unto the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\v 13 And all the company send, and speak, unto the sons of Benjamin who are in the rock Rimmon, and proclaim to them peace;
\v 14 and Benjamin turneth back at that time, and they give to them the women whom they have kept alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead, and they have not found for all of them so.
\v 15 And the people repented concerning Benjamin, for Yahweh had made a breach among the tribes of Israel.
\v 16 And the elders of the company say, 'What do we do to the remnant for wives — for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?'
\v 17 And they say, 'A possession of an escaped party is to Benjamin, and a tribe is not blotted out from Israel;
\v 18 and we — we are not able to give to them wives out of our daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed is he who is giving a wife to Benjamin.'
\v 19 And they say, 'Lo, a festival of Yahweh is in Shiloh, from time to time, which is on the north of Beth-El, at the rising of the sun, by the highway which is going up from Beth-El to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.'
\v 20 And they command the sons of Benjamin, saying, 'Go — and you have laid wait in the vineyards,
\v 21 and have seen, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances — then you have gone out from the vineyards, and caught for you each his wife out of the daughters of Shiloh, and gone to the land of Benjamin;
\v 22 and it had been, when their fathers or their brethren come in to plead unto us, that we have said unto them, Favour us by them, for we have not taken to each his wife in battle, for you — you have not given to them at this time that you are guilty.'
\v 23 And the sons of Benjamin do so, and take women according to their number, out of the dancers whom they have taken violently away; and they go, and turn back unto their inheritance, and build the cities, and dwell in them.
\v 24 And the sons of Israel go up and down there at that time, each to his tribe, and to his family; and they go out there each to his inheritance.
\v 25 In those days there is no king in Israel; each did that which is right in his own eyes.
