\c 1
\v 1 And Yahweh called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, Any man of you when he did bring near an offering to Yahweh, out of the cattle — out of the herd, or out of the flock — ye do bring near your offering.
\v 3 If his offering is a burnt-offering out of the herd — a male, a perfect one, he did bring near, unto the opening of the tent of meeting he did bring it near, at his pleasure, before Yahweh;
\v 4 and he had laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, and it had been accepted for him to make atonement for him;
\v 5 and he had slaughtered the son of the herd before Yahweh; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near, and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which is at the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 6 'And he had stripped the burnt-offering, and had cut it into its pieces;
\v 7 and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar, and arranged wood on the fire;
\v 8 and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces, with the head and the fat, on the wood, which is on the fire, which is on the altar;
\v 9 and its inwards and its legs he did wash with water; and the priest had made perfume with the whole on the altar, a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 10 And if his offering is out of the flock — out of the sheep or out of the goats — for a burnt-offering, a male, a perfect one, he did bring near,
\v 11 and he had slaughtered it by the side of the altar northward, before Yahweh; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;
\v 12 and he had cut it into its pieces, and its head and its fat, and the priest had arranged them on the wood, which is on the fire, which is on the altar;
\v 13 and the inwards and the legs he did wash with water, and the priest had brought the whole near, and had made perfume on the altar; it is a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 14 And if his offering is a burnt-offering out of the fowl to Yahweh, than he had brought near his offering out of the turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,
\v 15 and the priest had brought it near unto the altar, and had wrung off its head, and had made perfume on the altar, and its blood had been wrung out by the side of the altar;
\v 16 and he had turned aside its crop with its feathers, and had cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;
\v 17 and he had cleaved it with its wings (he did not separate it), and the priest had made it a perfume on the altar, on the wood, which is on the fire; it is a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\c 2
\v 1 'And when a person brought near an offering, a present to Yahweh, of flour is his offering, and he had poured on it oil, and had put on it frankincense;
\v 2 and he had brought it in unto the sons of Aaron, the priests, and he had taken from there the fulness of his hand of its flour and of its oil, besides all its frankincense, and the priest had made perfume with its memorial on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh;
\v 3 and the remnant of the present is for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Yahweh.
\v 4 And when you bringest near an offering, a present baked in an oven, it is of unleavened cakes of flour mixed with oil, or thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil.
\v 5 And if yours offering is a present made on the girdel, it is of flour, mixed with oil, unleavened;
\v 6 divide you it into parts, and you hast poured on it oil; it is a present.
\v 7 And if yours offering is a present made on the frying-pan, of flour with oil it is made,
\v 8 and you hast brought in the present which is made of these to Yahweh, and one had brought it near unto the priest, and he had brought it nigh unto the altar,
\v 9 and the priest had lifted up from the present its memorial, and had made perfume on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh;
\v 10 and the remnant of the present is for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Yahweh.
\v 11 No present which ye bring near to Yahweh is made fermented, for with any leaven or any honey ye perfume no fire-offering to Yahweh.
\v 12 An offering of first -fruits — ye bring them near to Yahweh, but on the altar they go not up, for sweet fragrance.
\v 13 And every offering — your present — with salt you will season, and you will not let the salt of the covenant of your God cease from your present; with all yours offerings you will bring near salt.
\v 14 And if you bring near a present of first-ripe fruits to Yahweh, — of green ears, roasted with fire, beaten out corn of a fruitful field you will bring near the present of your first-ripe fruits,
\v 15 and you hast put on it oil, and laid on it frankincense, it is a present;
\v 16 and the priest had made perfume with its memorial from its beaten out corn, and from its oil, besides all its frankincense — a fire-offering to Yahweh.
\c 3
\v 1 And if his offering is a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if out of the herd he is bringing near, whether male or female, a perfect one he did bring near before Yahweh,
\v 2 and he had laid his hand on the head of his offering, and had slaughtered it at the opening of the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.
\v 3 And he had brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Yahweh, the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which is on the inwards,
\v 4 and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he did turn it aside),
\v 5 and sons of Aaron have made it a perfume on the altar, on the burnt-offering which is on the wood, which is on the fire — a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 6 And if his offering is out of the flock for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, male or female, a perfect one he did bring near;
\v 7 if a sheep he is bringing near for his offering, then he had brought it near before Yahweh,
\v 8 and had laid his hand on the head of his offering, and had slaughtered it before the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about.
\v 9 And he had brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Yahweh, its fat, the whole fat tail (over-against the bone he did turn it aside), and the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which is on the inwards,
\v 10 and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he did turn it aside),
\v 11 and the priest had made it a perfume on the altar — bread of a fire-offering to Yahweh.
\v 12 And if his offering is a goat, then he had brought it near before Yahweh,
\v 13 and had laid his hand on its head, and had slaughtered it before the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;
\v 14 and he had brought near from it his offering, a fire-offering to Yahweh, the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which is on the inwards,
\v 15 and the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he did turn it aside),
\v 16 and the priest had made them a perfume on the altar — bread of a fire-offering, for sweet fragrance; all the fat is Yahweh's.
\v 17 'A statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings: any fat or any blood ye do not eat.'
\c 4
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, When a person did sin through ignorance against any of the commands of Yahweh regarding things which are not to be done, and had done something against one of these — 
\v 3 'If the priest who is anointed did sin according to the guilt of the people, then he had brought near for his sin which he had sinned a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, to Yahweh, for a sin-offering,
\v 4 and he had brought in the bullock unto the opening of the tent of meeting before Yahweh, and had laid his hand on the head of the bullock, and had slaughtered the bullock before Yahweh.
\v 5 'And the priest who is anointed had taken of the blood of the bullock, and had brought it in unto the tent of meeting,
\v 6 and the priest had dipped his finger in the blood, and sprinkled of the blood seven times before Yahweh, at the front of the vail of the sanctuary;
\v 7 and the priest had put of the blood on the horns of the altar of spice-perfume before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting, and all the blood of the bullock he did pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 8 And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he did lift up from it, the fat which is covering over the inwards, and all the fat which is on the inwards,
\v 9 and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he did turn it aside),
\v 10 as it is lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest had made them a perfume on the altar of the burnt-offering.
\v 11 And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, besides its head, and besides its legs, and its inwards, and its dung — 
\v 12 he had even brought out the whole bullock unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place, unto the place of the pouring out of the ashes, and he had burnt it on the wood with fire; beside the place of the pouring out of the ashes it is burnt.
\v 13 And if the whole company of Israel err ignorantly, and the thing had been hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done something against one of all the commands of Yahweh concerning things which are not to be done, and have been guilty;
\v 14 when the sin which they have sinned concerning it had been known, then have the assembly brought near a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and they have brought it in before the tent of meeting;
\v 15 and the elders of the company have laid their hands on the head of the bullock, before Yahweh, and one had slaughtered the bullock before Yahweh.
\v 16 'And the priest who is anointed had brought in of the blood of the bullock unto the tent of meeting,
\v 17 and the priest had dipped his finger in the blood, and had sprinkled seven times before Yahweh at the front of the vail,
\v 18 and some of the blood he did put on the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he did pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the opening of the tent of meeting;
\v 19 and all its fat he did lift up from it, and had made perfume on the altar.
\v 20 'And he had done to the bullock as he had done to the bullock of the sin-offering, so he did to it; and the priest had made atonement for them, and it had been forgiven them;
\v 21 and he had brought out the bullock unto the outside of the camp, and had burned it as he had burned the first bullock; it is a sin-offering of the assembly.
\v 22 When a prince did sin, and had done something against one of all the commands of Yahweh his God regarding things which are not to be done, through ignorance, and had been guilty — 
\v 23 or his sin wherein he had sinned had been made known unto him, then he had brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a male, a perfect one,
\v 24 and he had laid his hand on the head of the goat, and had slaughtered it in the place where he did slaughter the burnt-offering before Yahweh; it is a sin-offering.
\v 25 'And the priest had taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and had put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and its blood he did pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering,
\v 26 and with all its fat he did make perfume on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest had made atonement for him because of his sin, and it had been forgiven him.
\v 27 And if any person of the people of the land sin through ignorance, by his doing something against one of the commands of Yahweh regarding things which are not to be done, and had been guilty — 
\v 28 or his sin which he had sinned had been made known unto him, then he had brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a perfect one, a female, for his sin which he had sinned,
\v 29 and he had laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and had slaughtered the sin-offering in the place of the burnt-offering.
\v 30 'And the priest had taken of its blood with his finger, and had put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its blood he did pour out at the foundation of the altar,
\v 31 and all its fat he did turn aside, as the fat had been turned aside from off the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest had made perfume on the altar, for sweet fragrance to Yahweh; and the priest had made atonement for him, and it had been forgiven him.
\v 32 And if he bring in a sheep for his offering, for a sin-offering, a female, a perfect one, he did bring in,
\v 33 and he had laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and had slaughtered it for a sin-offering in the place where he slaughtereth the burnt-offering.
\v 34 'And the priest had taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and had put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its blood he poureth out at the foundation of the altar,
\v 35 and all its fat he turneth aside, as the fat of the sheep is turned aside from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest had made them a perfume on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of Yahweh, and the priest had made atonement for him, for his sin which he had sinned, and it had been forgiven him.
\c 5
\v 1 And when a person did sin, and had heard the voice of an oath, and he is witness, or had seen, or had known — if he declare not, then he had borne his iniquity:
\v 2 'Or when a person came against any thing unclean, or against a carcase of an unclean beast, or against a carcase of unclean cattle, or against a carcase of an unclean teeming creature, and it had been hidden from him, and he unclean, and guilty;
\v 3 'Or when he came against uncleanness of man, even any of his uncleanness whereby he is unclean, and it had been hidden from him, and he had known, and had been guilty:
\v 4 Or when a person sweareth, speaking wrongfully with the lips to do evil, or to do good, even anything which man spoke wrongfully with an oath, and it had been hid from him; — when he had known then he had been guilty of one of these;
\v 5 'And it had been when he is guilty of one of these, that he had confessed concerning that which he had sinned,
\v 6 and had brought in his guilt-offering to Yahweh for his sin which he had sinned, a female out of the flock, a lamb, or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering, and the priest had made atonement for him, because of his sin.
\v 7 And if his hand reach not to the sufficiency of a lamb, then he had brought in his guilt-offering — he who had sinned — two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to Yahweh, one for a sin-offering, and one for a burnt-offering;
\v 8 and he had brought them in unto the priest, and had brought near that which is for a sin-offering first, and had wrung off its head from its neck, and did not separate it,
\v 9 and he had sprinkled of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar, and that which is left of the blood is wrung out at the foundation of the altar; it is a sin-offering.
\v 10 'And the second he made a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance, and the priest had made atonement for him, because of his sin which he had sinned, and it had been forgiven him.
\v 11 And if his hand reach not to two turtle-doves, or to two young pigeons, then he had brought in his offering — he who had sinned — a tenth of an ephah of flour for a sin-offering; he putteth no oil on it, nor did he put on it frankincense, for it is a sin-offering,
\v 12 and he had brought it in unto the priest, and the priest had taken a handful from it — the fulness of his hand — its memorial — and had made perfume on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of Yahweh; it is a sin-offering.
\v 13 And the priest had made atonement for him, for his sin which he had sinned against one of these, and it had been forgiven him, and the remnant had been to the priest, like the present.'
\v 14 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 15 When a person committeth a trespass, and had sinned through ignorance against the holy things of Yahweh, then he had brought in his guilt-offering to Yahweh, a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at your valuation in silver — shekels by the shekel of the sanctuary — for a guilt-offering.
\v 16 'And that which he had sinned against the holy thing he repayeth, and its fifth is adding to it, and had given it to the priest, and the priest made atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and it had been forgiven him.
\v 17 And when any person sinneth, and had done something against one of all the commands of Yahweh regarding things which are not to be done, and had not known, and he had been guilty, and had borne his iniquity,
\v 18 'Then he had brought in a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at your valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest; and the priest had made atonement for him, for his ignorance in which he had erred and he had not known, and it had been forgiven him;
\v 19 it is a guilt-offering; he had been certainly guilty before Yahweh.'
\c 6
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'When any person did sin, and had committed a trespass against Yahweh, and had lied to his fellow concerning a deposit, or concerning fellowship, or concerning violent robbery, or had oppressed his fellow;
\v 3 or had found a lost thing, and had lied concerning it, and had sworn to a falsehood, concerning one of all these which man did, sinning in them:
\v 4 'Then it had been, when he sinneth, and had been guilty, that he had returned the plunder which he had taken violently away, or the thing which he had got by oppression, or the deposit which had been deposited with him, or the lost thing which he had found;
\v 5 or all that concerning which he sweareth falsely, he had even repaid it in its principal, and its fifth he is adding to it; to him whose it is he gave it in the day of his guilt-offering.
\v 6 'And his guilt-offering he brought in to Yahweh, a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at your estimation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest,
\v 7 and the priest had made atonement for him before Yahweh, and it had been forgiven him, concerning one thing of all that he did, by being guilty therein.'
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is a law of the burnt-offering (it is the burnt-offering, because of the burning on the altar all the night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar is burning on it,)
\v 10 that the priest had put on his long robe of fine linen, and his fine linen trousers he did put on his flesh, and had lifted up the ashes which the fire consumeth with the burnt-offering on the altar, and had put them near the altar;
\v 11 and he had stripped off his garments, and had put on other garments, and had brought out the ashes unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place.
\v 12 And the fire on the altar is burning on it, it is not quenched, and the priest had burned on it wood morning by morning, and had arranged on it the burnt-offering, and had made perfume on it with the fat of the peace-offerings;
\v 13 fire is continually burning on the altar, it is not quenched.
\v 14 And this is a law of the present: sons of Aaron have brought it near before Yahweh unto the front of the altar,
\v 15 and one had lifted up of it with his hand from the flour of the present, and from its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the present, and had made perfume on the altar, sweet fragrance — its memorial to Yahweh.
\v 16 And the remnant of it do Aaron and his sons eat; with unleavened things it is eaten, in the holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting they do eat it.
\v 17 It is not baken with any thing fermented, their portion I have given it, out of My fire-offerings; it is most holy, like the sin-offering, and like the guilt-offering.
\v 18 Every male among the sons of Aaron did eat it — a statute age-during to your generations, out of the fire-offerings of Yahweh: all that came against them is holy.'
\v 19 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 20 This is an offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they bring near to Yahweh in the day of his being anointed; a tenth of the ephah of flour for a continual present, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening;
\v 21 on a girdel with oil it is made — fried you will bring it in; baked pieces of the present you will bring near, a sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 22 And the priest who is anointed in his stead, from among his sons, did make it, — a statute age-during of Yahweh: it is completely perfumed;
\v 23 and every present of a priest is a whole burnt-offering; it is not eaten.'
\v 24 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 25 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, This is a law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered is the sin-offering slaughtered before Yahweh; it is most holy.
\v 26 'The priest who is making atonement with it did eat it, in the holy place it is eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting;
\v 27 all that came against its flesh is holy, and when any of its blood is sprinkled on the garment, that on which it is sprinkled you will wash in the holy place;
\v 28 and an earthen vessel in which it is boiled is broken, and if in a brass vessel it is boiled, then it is scoured and rinsed with water.
\v 29 Every male among the priests did eat it — it is most holy;
\v 30 and no sin-offering, any of whose blood is brought in unto the tent of meeting to make atonement in the sanctuary is eaten; with fire it is burnt.
\c 7
\v 1 And this is a law of the guilt-offering: it is most holy;
\v 2 in the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering they do slaughter the guilt-offering, and its blood one did sprinkle on the altar round about,
\v 3 and all its fat he brought near out of it, the fat tail, and the fat which is covering the inwards,
\v 4 and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver (beside the kidneys he did turn it aside);
\v 5 and the priest had made them a perfume on the altar, a fire-offering to Yahweh; it is a guilt-offering.
\v 6 Every male among the priests did eat it; in the holy place it is eaten — it is most holy;
\v 7 as is a sin-offering, so is a guilt-offering; one law is for them; the priest who made atonement by it — it is his.
\v 8 'And the priest who is bringing near any man's burnt-offering, the skin of the burnt-offering which he had brought near, it is the priest's, his own;
\v 9 and every present which is baked in an oven, and every one done in a frying-pan, and on a girdel, is the priest's who is bringing it near; it is his;
\v 10 and every present, mixed with oil or dry, is for all the sons of Aaron — one as another.
\v 11 And this is a law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which one brought near to Yahweh:
\v 12 if for a thank-offering he bring it near, then he had brought near with the sacrifice of thank-offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and of fried flour cakes mixed with oil;
\v 13 besides the cakes, fermented bread he did bring near with his offering, besides the sacrifice of thank-offering of his peace-offerings;
\v 14 and he had brought near out of it one of the whole offering — a heave-offering to Yahweh; to the priest who is sprinkling the blood of the peace-offerings — it is his;
\v 15 as to the flesh of the sacrifice of the thank-offering of his peace-offerings, in the day of his offering it is eaten; he did not leave of it till morning.
\v 16 And if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or free-will offering, in the day of his bringing near his sacrifice it is eaten; and on the morrow also the remnant of it is eaten;
\v 17 and the remnant of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day with fire is burnt;
\v 18 and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be really eaten on the third day, it is not pleasing; for him who is bringing it near it is not reckoned; it is an abominable thing, and the person who is eating of it his iniquity did bear.
\v 19 'And the flesh which came against any unclean thing is not eaten; with fire it is burnt; as to the flesh, every clean one did eat of the flesh;
\v 20 and the person who eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which are Yahweh's, and his uncleanness upon him, even that person had been cut off from his people.
\v 21 And when a person came against any thing unclean, of the uncleanness of man, or of the uncleanness of beasts, or of any unclean teeming creature, and had eaten of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which are Yahweh's, even that person had been cut off from his people.'
\v 22 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 23 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Any fat of ox and sheep and goat ye do not eat;
\v 24 and the fat of a carcase, and the fat of a torn thing is prepared for any work, but ye do certainly not eat it;
\v 25 for whoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which one brought near a fire-offering to Yahweh, even the person who eateth had been cut off from his people.
\v 26 'And any blood ye do not eat in all your dwellings, of fowl, or of beast;
\v 27 any person who eateth any blood, even that person had been cut off from his people.'
\v 28 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 29 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, He who is bringing near the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to Yahweh did bring in his offering to Yahweh from the sacrifice of his peace-offerings;
\v 30 his own hands do bring in the fire-offerings of Yahweh, the fat beside the breast, it he did bring in with the breast, to wave it — a wave-offering before Yahweh.
\v 31 'And the priest had made perfume with the fat on the altar, and the breast had been Aaron's and his sons;
\v 32 and the right leg ye do make a heave-offering to the priest of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings;
\v 33 he of the sons of Aaron who is bringing near the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, his is the right leg for a portion.
\v 34 'For the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, I have taken from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and I give them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a statute age-during, from the sons of Israel.'
\v 35 This is the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his sons out of the fire-offerings of Yahweh, in the day he had brought them near to act as priest to Yahweh,
\v 36 which Yahweh had commanded to give to them in the day of His anointing them, from the sons of Israel — a statute age-during to their generations.
\v 37 This is the law for burnt-offering, for present, and for sin-offering, and for guilt-offering, and for consecrations, and for a sacrifice of the peace-offerings,
\v 38 which Yahweh had commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day of his commanding the sons of Israel to bring near their offerings to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.
\c 8
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened things,
\v 3 and all the company assemble you unto the opening of the tent of meeting.'
\v 4 And Moses did as Yahweh had commanded him, and the company is assembled unto the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 5 and Moses said unto the company, 'This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded to do.'
\v 6 And Moses brought near Aaron and his sons, and did bathe them with water,
\v 7 and did put on him the coat, and did gird him with the girdle, and did clothe him with the upper robe, and did put on him the ephod, and did gird him with the girdle of the ephod, and did bind it to him with it,
\v 8 and did put on him the breastplate, and did put unto the breastplate the Lights and the Perfections,
\v 9 and did put the mitre on his head, and did put on the mitre, over-against its front, the golden flower of the holy crown, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 10 And Moses taketh the anointing oil, and anointeth the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and sanctifieth them;
\v 11 and he sprinkleth of it on the altar seven times, and anointeth the altar, and all its vessels, and the laver, and its base, to sanctify them;
\v 12 and he poureth of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron, and anointeth him to sanctify him.
\v 13 And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron, and did clothe them with coats, and girdeth them with girdles, and bindeth for them turbans, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 14 And he brought nigh the bullock of the sin-offering, and Aaron laid — his sons also — their hands on the head of the bullock of the sin-offering,
\v 15 and one slaughtereth, and Moses taketh the blood, and putteth on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and cleanseth the altar, and the blood he had poured out at the foundation of the altar, and sanctifieth it, to make atonement upon it.
\v 16 And he taketh all the fat that is on the inwards, and the redundance above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made Perfume on the altar,
\v 17 and the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he had burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 18 And he brought near the ram of the burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons lay their hands on the head of the ram,
\v 19 and one slaughtereth, and Moses sprinkleth the blood on the altar round about;
\v 20 and the ram he had cut into its pieces, and Moses made perfume with the head, and the pieces, and the fat,
\v 21 and the inwards and the legs he had washed with water, and Moses made perfume with the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance; it is a fire-offering to Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 22 And he brought near the second ram, a ram of the consecrations, and Aaron and his sons lay their hands on the head of the ram,
\v 23 and one slaughtereth, and Moses taketh of its blood, and putteth on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
\v 24 and he brought near the sons of Aaron, and Moses putteth of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot. And Moses sprinkleth the blood on the altar round about,
\v 25 and taketh the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that is on the inwards, and the redundance above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right leg;
\v 26 and out of the basket of unleavened things, which is before Yahweh, he had taken one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one thin cake, and putteth them on the fat, and on the right leg;
\v 27 and putteth the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and waveth them — a wave-offering before Yahweh.
\v 28 And Moses taketh them from off their hands, and made perfume on the altar, on the burnt-offering, they are consecrations for sweet fragrance; it is a fire-offering to Yahweh;
\v 29 and Moses taketh the breast, and waveth it — a wave-offering before Yahweh; of the ram of the consecrations it had been to Moses for a portion, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 30 And Moses taketh of the anointing oil, and of the blood which is on the altar, and sprinkleth on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him, and he sanctifieth Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
\v 31 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto his sons, 'Boil ye the flesh at the opening of the tent of meeting, and there ye do eat it and the bread which is in the basket of the consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons do eat it.
\v 32 'And the remnant of the flesh and of the bread with fire ye burn;
\v 33 and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye go not out seven days, till the day of the fulness, the days of your consecration — for seven days he did consecrate your hand;
\v 34 as he had done on this day, Yahweh had commanded to do, to make atonement for you;
\v 35 and at the opening of the tent of meeting ye abide, by day and by night seven days, and ye have kept the charge of Yahweh, and die not, for so I have been commanded.'
\v 36 And Aaron did — his sons also — all the things which Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses.
\c 9
\v 1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, Moses had called for Aaron and for his sons, and for the elders of Israel,
\v 2 and he said unto Aaron, 'Take to yourself a calf, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, perfect ones, and bring near before Yahweh.
\v 3 'And unto the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf, and a lamb, sons of a year, perfect ones, for a burnt-offering,
\v 4 and a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh, and a present mixed with oil; for to-day Yahweh had appeared unto you.'
\v 5 And they take that which Moses had commanded unto the front of the tent of meeting, and all the company draw near and stand before Yahweh;
\v 6 and Moses said, 'This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded; do it, and the honour of Yahweh did appear unto you.'
\v 7 And Moses said unto Aaron, 'Draw near unto the altar, and make your sin-offering, and your burnt-offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people, and make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh had commanded.'
\v 8 And Aaron draweth near unto the altar, and slaughtereth the calf of the sin-offering, which is for himself;
\v 9 and the sons of Aaron bring the blood near unto him, and he dippeth his finger in the blood, and putteth it on the horns of the altar, and the blood he had poured out at the foundation of the altar;
\v 10 and the fat, and the kidneys, and the redundance of the liver, of the sin-offering, he had made a perfume on the altar, as Yahweh had commanded Moses;
\v 11 and the flesh and the skin he had burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp.
\v 12 And he slaughtereth the burnt-offering, and the sons of Aaron have presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about;
\v 13 and the burnt-offering they have presented unto him, by its pieces, and the head, and he made perfume on the altar;
\v 14 and he washeth the inwards and the legs, and made perfume for the burnt-offering on the altar.
\v 15 And he brought near the offering of the people, and taketh the goat of the sin-offering which is for the people, and slaughtered it, and made it a sin-offering, like the first;
\v 16 and he brought near the burnt-offering, and made it, according to the ordinance;
\v 17 and he brought near the present, and filleth his palm with it, and made perfume on the altar, apart from the burnt-offering of the morning.
\v 18 And he slaughtereth the bullock and the ram, a sacrifice of the peace-offerings, which are for the people, and sons of Aaron present the blood unto him (and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about),
\v 19 and the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the fat tail, and the covering of the inwards, and the kidneys, and the redundance above the liver,
\v 20 and they set the fat on the breasts, and he made perfume with the fat on the altar;
\v 21 and the breasts, and the right leg had Aaron waved — a wave-offering before Yahweh, as He had commanded Moses.
\v 22 And Aaron lifteth up his hand towards the people, and blessed them, and came down from making the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
\v 23 And Moses went in — Aaron also — unto the tent of meeting, and they come out, and bless the people, and the honour of Yahweh appeareth unto all the people;
\v 24 and fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumeth on the altar the burnt-offering, and the fat; and all the people see, and cry aloud, and fall on their faces.
\c 10
\v 1 And the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, take each his censer, and put in them fire, and put on it perfume, and bring near before Yahweh strange fire, which He had not commanded them;
\v 2 and fire went out from before Yahweh, and consumeth them, and they die before Yahweh.
\v 3 And Moses said unto Aaron, 'It is that which Yahweh had spoken, saying, By those drawing near to Me I am sanctified, and in the face of all the people I am honoured;' and Aaron is silent.
\v 4 And Moses called unto Mishael and unto Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, 'Come near, bear your brethren from the front of the sanctuary unto the outside of the camp;'
\v 5 and they come near, and bear them in their coats unto the outside of the camp, as Moses had spoken.
\v 6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar his sons, 'Your heads ye do not uncover, and your garments ye do not rend, that ye die not, and on all the company He be wroth; as to your brethren, the whole house of Israel, they bewail the burning which Yahweh had kindled;
\v 7 and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye do not go out, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of Yahweh is upon you;' and they do according to the word of Moses.
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke unto Aaron, saying,
\v 9 Wine and strong drink you will not drink, you, and your sons with thee, in your going in unto the tent of meeting, and ye die not — a statute age-during to your generations;
\v 10 so as to make a separation between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the pure;
\v 11 and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh had spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.'
\v 12 And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar his sons, who are left, 'Take ye the present that is left from the fire-offerings of Yahweh, and eat it unleavened near the altar, for it is most holy,
\v 13 and ye have eaten it in the holy place, for it is your portion, and the portion of your sons, from the fire-offerings of Yahweh; for so I have been commanded.
\v 14 'And the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, ye do eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with thee; for your portion and the portion of your sons they have been given, out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the sons of Israel;
\v 15 the leg of the heave-offering, and breast of the wave-offering, besides fire-offerings of the fat, they do bring in to wave a wave-offering before Yahweh, and it had been to thee, and to your sons with thee, by a statute age-during, as Yahweh had commanded.'
\v 16 And the goat of the sin-offering had Moses diligently sought, and lo, it is burnt, and he is wroth against Eleazar, and against Ithamar, sons of Aaron, who are left, saying,
\v 17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, for it is most holy — and it He had given to you to take away the iniquity of the company, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?
\v 18 lo, its blood had not been brought in unto the holy place within; eating ye do eat it in the holy place, as I have commanded.'
\v 19 And Aaron spoke unto Moses, 'Lo, to-day they have brought near their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Yahweh; and things like these meet me, yet I have eaten a sin-offering to-day; is it good in the eyes of Yahweh?'
\v 20 And Moses hearkeneth, and it is good in his eyes.
\c 11
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying unto them,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, This is the beast which ye do eat out of all the beasts which are on the earth:
\v 3 any dividing a hoof, and cleaving the cleft of the hoofs, bringing up the cud, among the beasts, it ye do eat.
\v 4 Only, this ye do not eat — of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the hoof — the camel, yough it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof not dividing — it is unclean to you;
\v 5 and the rabbit, yough it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof it divideth not — unclean it is to you;
\v 6 and the hare, yough it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof had not divided — unclean it is to you;
\v 7 and the sow, yough it is dividing the hoof, and cleaving the cleft of the hoof, yet the cud it brought not up — unclean it is to you.
\v 8 Of their flesh ye do not eat, and against their carcase ye do not come — unclean they are to you.
\v 9 This ye do eat of all which are in the waters; any one that had fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the brooks, them ye do eat;
\v 10 and any one that had not fins and scales in the seas, and in the brooks, of any teeming creature of the waters, and of any creature which lived, which is in the waters — an abomination they are to you;
\v 11 yea, an abomination they are to you; of their flesh ye do not eat, and their carcase ye abominate.
\v 12 Any one that had not fins and scales in the waters — an abomination it is to you.
\v 13 And these ye do abominate of the fowl; they are not eaten, an abomination they are: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
\v 14 and the vulture, and the kite after its kind,
\v 15 every raven after its kind,
\v 16 and the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind,
\v 17 and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
\v 18 and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
\v 19 and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
\v 20 Every teeming creature which is flying, which is going on four — an abomination it is to you.
\v 21 Only — this ye do eat of any teeming thing which is flying, which is going on four, which had legs above its feet, to move with them on the earth;
\v 22 these of them ye do eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the beetle after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind;
\v 23 and every teeming thing which is flying, which had four feet — an abomination it is to you.
\v 24 'And by these ye are made unclean, any one who is coming against their carcase is unclean till the evening;
\v 25 and anyone who is lifting up aught of their carcase did wash his garments, and had been unclean till the evening: — 
\v 26 even every beast which is dividing the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, and the cud is not bringing up — unclean they are to you; any one who is coming against them is unclean.
\v 27 And any one going on its paws, among all the beasts which are going on four — unclean they are to you; any one who is coming against their carcase is unclean until the evening;
\v 28 and he who is lifting up their carcase did wash his garments, and had been unclean until the evening — unclean they are to you.
\v 29 And this is to you the unclean among the teeming things which are teeming on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after its kind,
\v 30 and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole;
\v 31 these are the unclean to you among all which are teeming; any one who is coming against them in their death is unclean till the evening.
\v 32 'And anything on which any one of them falleth, in their death, is unclean, of any vessel of wood or garment or skin or sack, any vessel in which work is done is brought into water, and had been unclean till the evening, then it had been clean;
\v 33 and any earthen vessel, into the middle of which any one of them falleth, all that is in its middle is unclean, and it ye do break.
\v 34 Of all the food which is eaten, that on which came such water, is unclean, and all drink which is drunk in any such vessel is unclean;
\v 35 and anything on which any of their carcase falleth is unclean (oven or double pots), it is broken down, unclean they are, yea, unclean they are to you.
\v 36 Only — a fountain or pit, a collection of water, is clean, but that which is coming against their carcase is unclean;
\v 37 and when any of their carcase falleth on any sown seed which is sown — it is clean;
\v 38 and when water is put on the seed, and any of its carcase had fallen on it — unclean it is to you.
\v 39 'And when any of the beasts which are to you for food dieth, he who is coming against its carcase is unclean till the evening;
\v 40 and he who is eating of its carcase did wash his garments, and had been unclean till the evening; and he who is lifting up its carcase did wash his garments, and had been unclean till the evening.
\v 41 'And every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth is an abomination, it is not eaten;
\v 42 any thing going on the belly, and any going on four, unto every multiplier of feet, to every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth — ye do not eat them, for they are an abomination;
\v 43 ye do not make yourselves abominable with any teeming thing which is teeming, nor do ye make yourselves unclean with them, so that ye have been unclean thereby.
\v 44 For I am Yahweh your God, and ye have sanctified yourselves, and ye have been holy, for I am holy; and ye do not defile your persons with any teeming thing which is creeping on the earth;
\v 45 for I am Yahweh who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt to become your God; and ye have been holy, for I am holy.
\v 46 This is a law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature which is moving in the waters, and of every creature which is teeming on the earth,
\v 47 to make separation between the unclean and the pure, and between the beast that is eaten, and the beast that is not eaten.'
\c 12
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she gave seed, and had born a male, then she had been unclean seven days, according to the days of separation for her sickness she is unclean;
\v 3 and in the eighth day is the flesh of his foreskin circumcised;
\v 4 and thirty and three days she did abide in the blood of her cleansing; against any holy thing she did not come, and unto the sanctuary she did not go in, till the fulness of the days of her cleansing.
\v 5 'And if a female she bear, then she had been unclean two weeks, as in her separation; and sixty and six days she did abide for the blood of her cleansing.
\v 6 'And in the fulness of the days of her cleansing for son or for daughter she did bring in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, unto the priest;
\v 7 and he had brought it near before Yahweh, and had made atonement for her, and she had been cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who is bearing, in regard to a male or to a female.
\v 8 'And if her hand find not the sufficiency of a sheep, then she had taken two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, one for a burnt-offering, and one for a sin-offering, and the priest had made atonement for her, and she had been cleansed.'
\c 13
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 2 'When a man had in the skin of his flesh a rising, or scab, or bright spot, and it had become in the skin of his flesh a leprous plague, then he had been brought in unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests;
\v 3 and the priest had seen the plague in the skin of the flesh, and the hair in the plague had turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the skin of his flesh — it is a plague of leprosy, and the priest had seen him, and had pronounced him unclean.
\v 4 And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair had not turned white, then had the priest shut up him who had the plague seven days.
\v 5 'And the priest had seen him on the seventh day, and lo, the plague had stood in his eyes, the plague had not spread in the skin, and the priest had shut him up a second seven days.
\v 6 And the priest had seen him on the second seventh day, and lo, the plague is become weak, and the plague had not spread in the skin — and the priest had pronounced him clean, it is a scab, and he had washed his garments, and had been clean.
\v 7 'And if the scab spread greatly in the skin, after his being seen by the priest for his cleansing, then he had been seen a second time by the priest;
\v 8 and the priest had seen, and lo, the scab had spread in the skin, and the priest had pronounced him unclean; it is leprosy.
\v 9 'When a plague of leprosy is in a man, then he had been brought in unto the priest,
\v 10 and the priest had seen, and lo, a white rising in the skin, and it had turned the hair white, and a quickening of raw flesh is in the rising, — 
\v 11 an old leprosy it is in the skin of his flesh, and the priest had pronounced him unclean; he did not shut him up, for he is unclean.
\v 12 And if the leprosy break out greatly in the skin, and the leprosy had covered all the skin of him who had the plague, from his head even unto his feet, to all that appeareth to the eyes of the priest,
\v 13 then had the priest seen, and lo, the leprosy had covered all his flesh, and he had pronounced him who had the plague clean; it had all turned white; he is clean.
\v 14 'And in the day of raw flesh being seen in him he is unclean;
\v 15 and the priest had seen the raw flesh, and had pronounced him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.
\v 16 Or when the raw flesh turneth back, and had been turned to white, then he had come in unto the priest,
\v 17 and the priest had seen him, and lo, the plague had been turned to white, and the priest had pronounced clean him who had the plague; he is clean.
\v 18 'And when flesh had in it, in its skin, an ulcer, and it had been healed,
\v 19 and there had been in the place of the ulcer a white rising, or a bright white spot, very red, then it had been seen by the priest,
\v 20 and the priest had seen, and lo, its appearance is lower than the skin, and its hair had turned white, and the priest had pronounced him unclean; it is a plague of leprosy — in an ulcer it had broken out.
\v 21 'And if the priest see it, and lo, there is no white hair in it, and it is not lower than the skin, and is become weak, then had the priest shut him up seven days;
\v 22 and if it spread greatly in the skin, then had the priest pronounced him unclean, it is a plague;
\v 23 and if in its place the bright spot stay — it had not spread — it is an inflammation of the ulcer; and the priest had pronounced him clean.
\v 24 'Or when flesh had in its skin a fiery burning, and the quickening of the burning, the bright white spot, had been very red or white,
\v 25 and the priest had seen it, and lo, the hair had turned white in the bright spot, and its appearance is deeper than the skin; leprosy it is, in the burning it had broken out, and the priest had pronounced him unclean; it is a plague of leprosy.
\v 26 'And if the priest see it, and lo, there is no white hair on the bright spot, and it is not lower than the skin, and it is become weak, then the priest had shut him up seven days;
\v 27 and the priest had seen him on the seventh day, if it spread greatly in the skin, then the priest had pronounced him unclean; a plague of leprosy it is.
\v 28 And if the bright spot stay in its place, it had not spread in the skin, and is become weak; a rising of the burning it is, and the priest had pronounced him clean; for it is inflammation of the burning.
\v 29 'And when a man (or a woman) had in him a plague in the head or in the beard,
\v 30 then had the priest seen the plague, and lo, its appearance is deeper than the skin, and in it a thin shining hair, and the priest had pronounced him unclean; it is a scall — it is a leprosy of the head or of the beard.
\v 31 And when the priest saw the plague of the scall, and lo, its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then had the priest shut up him who had the plague of the scall seven days.
\v 32 'And the priest had seen the plague on the seventh day, and lo, the scall had not spread, and a shining hair had not been in it, and the appearance of the scall is not deeper than the skin,
\v 33 then he had shaved himself, but the scall he did not shave; and the priest had shut up him who had the scall a second seven days.
\v 34 And the priest had seen the scall on the seventh day, and lo, the scall had not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and the priest had pronounced him clean, and he had washed his garments, and had been clean.
\v 35 'And if the scall spread greatly in the skin after his cleansing,
\v 36 and the priest had seen him, and lo, the scall had spread in the skin, the priest seeketh not for the shining hair, he is unclean;
\v 37 and if in his eyes the scall had stayed, and black hair had sprung up in it, the scall had been healed — he is clean — and the priest had pronounced him clean.
\v 38 'And when a man or woman had in the skin of their flesh bright spots, white bright spots,
\v 39 and the priest had seen, and lo, in the skin of their flesh white weak bright spots, it is a freckled spot broken out in the skin; he is clean.
\v 40 And when a man's head is polished, he is bald, he is clean;
\v 41 and if from the corner of his face his head is polished, he is bald of the forehead; he is clean.
\v 42 And when there is in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead, a very red white plague, it is a leprosy breaking out in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead;
\v 43 and the priest had seen him, and lo, the rising of the very red white plague in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead, is as the appearance of leprosy, in the skin of the flesh,
\v 44 he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest did pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.
\v 45 As to the leper in whom is the plague, his garments are rent, and his head is uncovered, and he covereth over the upper lip, and 'Unclean! unclean!' he called;
\v 46 all the days that the plague is in him he is unclean; he is unclean, alone he did dwell, at the outside of the camp is his dwelling.
\v 47 And when there is in any garment a plague of leprosy, — in a garment of wool, or in a garment of linen,
\v 48 or in the warp, or in the woof, of linen or of wool, or in a skin, or in any work of skin,
\v 49 and the plague had been very green or very red in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin, it is a plague of leprosy, and it had been shewn the priest.
\v 50 And the priest had seen the plague, and had shut up that which had the plague, seven days;
\v 51 and he had seen the plague on the seventh day, and the plague had spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, of all that is made of skin for work; the plague is a fretting leprosy, it is unclean.
\v 52 And he had burnt the garment, or the warp, or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any vessel of skin in which the plague is; for it is a fretting leprosy; with fire it is burnt.
\v 53 'And if the priest see, and lo, the plague had not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin,
\v 54 then had the priest commanded, and they have washed that in which the plague is, and he had shut it up a second seven days.
\v 55 And the priest had seen that which had the plague after it had been washed, and lo, the plague had not changed its aspect, and the plague had not spread, — it is unclean; with fire you will burn it; it is a fretting in its back-part or in its front-part.
\v 56 And if the priest had seen, and lo, the plague is become weak after it had been washed, then he had rent it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof;
\v 57 and if it still be seen in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin, it is a fretting; with fire you will burn it — that in which the plague is.
\v 58 'And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any vessel of skin which you will wash when the plague had turned aside from them, then it had been washed a second time, and had been clean.
\v 59 This is the law of a plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen, or of the warp or of the woof, or of any vessel of skin, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.'
\c 14
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'This is a law of the leper, in the day of his cleansing, that he had been brought in unto the priest,
\v 3 and the priest had gone out unto the outside of the camp, and the priest had seen, and lo, the plague of leprosy had ceased from the leper,
\v 4 and the priest had commanded, and he had taken for him who is to be cleansed, two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
\v 5 'And the priest had commanded, and he had slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;
\v 6 as to the living bird, he taketh it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and had dipped them and the living bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, over the running water,
\v 7 and he had sprinkled on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and had pronounced him clean, and had sent out the living bird on the face of the field.
\v 8 'And he who is to be cleansed had washed his garments, and had shaved all his hair, and had bathed with water, and had been clean, and afterwards he did come in unto the camp, and had dwelt at the outside of his tent seven days.
\v 9 And it had been, on the seventh day — he shaveth all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair he did shave, and he had washed his garments, and had bathed his flesh with water, and had been clean.
\v 10 And on the eighth day he taketh two lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe-lamb, daughter of a year, a perfect one, and three tenth deals of flour for a present, mixed with oil, and one log of oil.
\v 11 'And the priest who is cleansing had caused the man who is to be cleansed to stand with them before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 12 and the priest had taken the one he-lamb, and had brought it near for a guilt-offering, also the log of oil, and had waved them — a wave offering before Yahweh.
\v 13 And he had slaughtered the lamb in the place where he slaughtereth the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy place; for like the sin-offering the guilt-offering is to the priest; it is most holy.
\v 14 'And the priest had taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest had put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
\v 15 and the priest had taken of the log of oil, and had poured on the left palm of the priest,
\v 16 and the priest had dipped his right finger in the oil which is on his left palm, and had sprinkled of the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh.
\v 17 And of the residue of the oil which is on his palm, the priest putteth on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt-offering;
\v 18 and the remnant of the oil which is on the palm of the priest, he putteth on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest had made atonement for him before Yahweh.
\v 19 'And the priest had made the sin-offering, and had made atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness, and afterwards he did slaughter the burnt-offering;
\v 20 and the priest had caused the burnt-offering to ascend, also the present, on the altar, and the priest had made atonement for him, and he had been clean.
\v 21 And if he is poor, and his hand is not reaching these things, then he had taken one lamb — a guilt-offering, for a wave-offering, to make atonement for him, and one-tenth deal of flour mixed with oil for a present, and a log of oil,
\v 22 and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, which his hand reacheth to, and one had been a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering;
\v 23 and he had brought them in on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh.
\v 24 And the priest had taken the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest had waved them — a wave-offering before Yahweh;
\v 25 and he had slaughtered the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest had taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and had put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
\v 26 and the priest did pour of the oil on the left palm of the priest;
\v 27 and the priest had sprinkled with his right finger of the oil which is on his left palm, seven times before Yahweh.
\v 28 And the priest had put of the oil which is on his palm, on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt-offering;
\v 29 and the remnant of the oil which is on the palm of the priest he did put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him, before Yahweh.
\v 30 'And he had made the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons (from that which his hand reacheth to,
\v 31 even that which his hand reacheth to), the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt offering, besides the present, and the priest had made atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Yahweh.
\v 32 This is a law of him in whom is a plague of leprosy, whose hand reacheth not to his cleansing.'
\v 33 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 34 When ye come in unto the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you for a possession, and I have put a plague of leprosy in a house in the land of your possession;
\v 35 then had he whose the house is come in and declared to the priest, saying, As a plague had appeared to me in the house;
\v 36 and the priest had commanded, and they have prepared the house before the priest came in to see the plague (that all which is in the house be not unclean), and afterwards did the priest come in to see the house;
\v 37 and he had seen the plague, and lo, the plague is in the walls of the house, hollow strakes, very green or very red, and their appearance is lower than the wall,
\v 38 and the priest had gone out of the house unto the opening of the house, and had shut up the house seven days.
\v 39 'And the priest had turned back on the seventh day, and had seen, and lo, the plague had spread in the walls of the house,
\v 40 and the priest had commanded, and they have drawn out the stones in which the plague is, and have cast them unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place;
\v 41 and the house he did cause to be scraped within round about, and they have poured out the clay which they have scraped off, at the outside of the city, at an unclean place;
\v 42 and they have taken other stones, and brought them in unto the place of the stones, and other clay he taketh and had daubed the house.
\v 43 'And if the plague return, and had broken out in the house, after he had drawn out the stones, and after the scraping of the house, and after the daubing;
\v 44 then had the priest come in and seen, and lo, the plague had spread in the house; it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
\v 45 And he had broken down the house, its stones, and its wood, and all the clay of the house, and he had brought them forth unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place.
\v 46 'And he who is going in unto the house all the days he had shut it up, is unclean till the evening;
\v 47 and he who is lying in the house did wash his garments; and he who is eating in the house did wash his garments.
\v 48 'And if the priest certainly come in, and had seen, and lo, the plague had not spread in the house after the daubing of the house, then had the priest pronounced the house clean, for the plague had been healed.
\v 49 'And he had taken for the cleansing of the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop;
\v 50 and he had slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;
\v 51 and he had taken the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and had dipped them in the blood of the slaughtered bird, and in the running water, and had sprinkled upon the house seven times.
\v 52 'And he had cleansed the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;
\v 53 and he had sent away the living bird unto the outside of the city unto the face of the field, and had made atonement for the house, and it had been clean.
\v 54 This is the law for every plague of the leprosy and for scall,
\v 55 and for leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
\v 56 and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot, — 
\v 57 to direct in the day of being unclean, and in the day of being clean; this is the law of the leprosy.'
\c 15
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, and ye have said unto them, When there is an issue out of the flesh of any man, for his issue he is unclean;
\v 3 and this is his uncleanness in his issue — his flesh had run with his issue, or his flesh had stopped from his issue; it is his uncleanness.
\v 4 'All the bed on which he lieth who had the issue is unclean, and all the vessel on which he sitteth is unclean;
\v 5 and any one who came against his bed did wash his garments, and had bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 6 'And he who is sitting on the vessel on which he sitteth who had the issue, did wash his garments, and had bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 7 'And he who is coming against the flesh of him who had the issue, did wash his garments, and had bathed with water, and had been unclean till the evening.
\v 8 'And when he who had the issue spitteth on him who is clean, then he had washed his garments, and had bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 9 'And all the saddle on which he rideth who had the issue is unclean;
\v 10 and any one who is coming against anything which is under him is unclean till the evening, and he who is bearing them did wash his garments, and had bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 11 'And anyone against whom he came who had the issue (and his hands had not rinsed with water) had even washed his garments, and bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 12 'And the earthen vessel which he who had the issue came against is broken; and every wooden vessel is rinsed with water.
\v 13 'And when he who had the issue is clean from his issue, then he had numbered to himself seven days for his cleansing, and had washed his garments, and had bathed his flesh with running water, and been clean.
\v 14 'And on the eighth day he taketh to himself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and had come in before Yahweh unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and had given them unto the priest;
\v 15 and the priest had made them, one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering; and the priest had made atonement for him before Yahweh, because of his issue.
\v 16 'And when a man's seed of copulation went out from him, then he had bathed with water all his flesh, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 17 'And any garment, or any skin on which there is seed of copulation, had also been washed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 18 'And a woman with whom a man lieth with seed of copulation, they also have bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 19 And when a woman had an issue — blood is her issue in her flesh — seven days she is in her separation, and any one who is coming against her is unclean till the evening.
\v 20 'And anything on which she lieth in her separation is unclean, and anything on which she sitteth is unclean;
\v 21 and any one who is coming against her bed did wash his garments, and had bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 22 'And any one who is coming against any vessel on which she sitteth did wash his garments, and had washed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 23 And if it is on the bed, or on the vessel on which she is sitting, in his coming against it, he is unclean till the evening.
\v 24 'And if a man really lie with her, and her separation is on him, then he had been unclean seven days, and all the bed on which he lieth is unclean.
\v 25 And when a woman's issue of blood floweth many days within the time of her separation, or when it floweth over her separation — all the days of the issue of her uncleanness are as the days of her separation; she is unclean.
\v 26 'All the bed on which she lieth all the days of her issue is as the bed of her separation to her, and all the vessel on which she sitteth is unclean as the uncleanness of her separation;
\v 27 and any one who is coming against them is unclean, and had washed his garments, and had bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
\v 28 'And if she had been clean from her issue, then she had numbered to herself seven days, and afterwards she is clean;
\v 29 and on the eighth day she taketh to herself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and had brought them in unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting;
\v 30 and the priest had made the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering, and the priest had made atonement for her before Yahweh, because of the issue of her uncleanness.
\v 31 And ye have separated the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, and they die not in their uncleanness, in their defiling My tabernacle which is in their middle.
\v 32 This is the law of him who had an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation went out from him, for uncleanness thereby,
\v 33 and of her who is sick in her separation, and of him who had an issue, the issue of a male or of a female, and of a man who lieth with an unclean woman.'
\c 16
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, in their drawing near before Yahweh, and they die;
\v 2 yea, Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Speak unto Aaron your brother, and he came not in at all times unto the sanctuary within the vail, unto the front of the mercy-seat, which is upon the ark, and he dieth not, for in a cloud I am seen upon the mercy-seat.
\v 3 'With this did Aaron come in unto the sanctuary; with a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering;
\v 4 a holy linen coat he putteth on, and linen trousers are on his flesh, and with a linen girdle he girdeth himself, and with a linen mitre he wrappeth himself up; they are holy garments; and he had bathed with water his flesh, and had put them on.
\v 5 'And from the company of the sons of Israel he taketh two kids of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering;
\v 6 and Aaron had brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own, and had made atonement for himself, and for his house;
\v 7 and he had taken the two goats, and had caused them to stand before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 8 'And Aaron had given lots over the two goats, one lot for Yahweh, and one lot for a goat of departure;
\v 9 and Aaron had brought near the goat on which the lot for Yahweh had gone up, and had made it a sin-offering.
\v 10 'And the goat on which the lot for a goat of departure had gone up is caused to stand living before Yahweh to make atonement by it, to send it away for a goat of departure into the wilderness.
\v 11 And Aaron had brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own, and had made atonement for himself, and for his house, and had slaughtered the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own,
\v 12 and had taken the fulness of the censer of burning coals of fire from off the altar, from before Yahweh, and the fulness of his hands of thin spice-perfume, and had brought it within the vail;
\v 13 and he had put the perfume on the fire before Yahweh, and the cloud of the perfume had covered the mercy-seat which is on the testimony, and he dieth not.
\v 14 'And he had taken of the blood of the bullock, and had sprinkled with his finger on the front of the mercy-seat eastward; even at the front of the mercy-seat he did sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger.
\v 15 And he had slaughtered the goat of the sin-offering which is the people's, and had brought in its blood unto the inside of the vail, and had done with its blood as he had done with the blood of the bullock, and had sprinkled it on the mercy-seat, and at the front of the mercy-seat,
\v 16 and he had made atonement for the sanctuary because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins; and so he did for the tent of meeting which is tabernacling with them in the middle of their uncleannesses.
\v 17 'And no man is in the tent of meeting in his going in to make atonement in the sanctuary, till his coming out; and he had made atonement for himself, and for his house, and for all the assembly of Israel.
\v 18 And he had gone out unto the altar which is before Yahweh, and had made atonement for it; and he had taken of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and had put on the horns of the altar round about;
\v 19 and he had sprinkled on it of the blood with his finger seven times, and had cleansed it, and had hallowed it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.
\v 20 And he had ceased from making atonement for the sanctuary, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, and had brought near the living goat;
\v 21 and Aaron had laid his two hands on the head of the living goat, and had confessed over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, and had put them on the head of the goat, and had sent it away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness;
\v 22 and the goat had borne on him all their iniquities unto a land of separation. 'And he had sent the goat away into the wilderness,
\v 23 and Aaron had come in unto the tent of meeting, and had stripped off the linen garments which he had put on in his going in unto the sanctuary, and had placed them there;
\v 24 and he had bathed his flesh with water in the holy place, and had put on his garments, and had come out, and had made his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and had made atonement for himself and for the people;
\v 25 and with the fat of the sin-offering he did make perfume on the altar.
\v 26 'And he who is sending away the goat for a goat of departure did wash his garments, and had bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he came in unto the camp.
\v 27 And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood had been brought in to make atonement in the sanctuary, did one bring out unto the outside of the camp, and they have burnt with fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung;
\v 28 and he who is burning them did wash his garments, and had bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he came in unto the camp.
\v 29 And it had been to you for a statute age-during, in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, ye humble yourselves, and do no work — the native, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your middle;
\v 30 for on this day he made atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before Yahweh ye are clean;
\v 31 it is to you a sabbath of rest, and ye have humbled yourselves — a statute age-during.
\v 32 'And the priest whom he did anoint, and whose hand he did consecrate to act as priest instead of his father, had made atonement, and had put on the linen garments, the holy garments;
\v 33 and he had made atonement for the holy sanctuary; and for the tent of meeting, even for the altar he did make atonement; yea, for the priests, and for all the people of the assembly he made atonement.
\v 34 'And this had been to you for a statute age-during, to make atonement for the sons of Israel, because of all their sins, once in a year;' and he did as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\c 17
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel; and you hast said unto them, This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded, saying,
\v 3 Any man of the house of Israel who slaughtereth ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who slaughtereth at the outside of the camp,
\v 4 and unto the opening of the tent of meeting had not brought it in to bring near an offering to Yahweh before the tabernacle of Yahweh, blood is reckoned to that man — blood he had shed — and that man had been cut off from the middle of his people;
\v 5 so that the sons of Israel do bring in their sacrifices which they are sacrificing on the face of the field, yea, they have brought them in to Yahweh, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and they have sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings to Yahweh with them.
\v 6 'And the priest had sprinkled the blood upon the altar of Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting, and had made perfume with the fat for sweet fragrance to Yahweh;
\v 7 and they sacrifice not any more their sacrifices to goats after which they are going a-whoring; a statute age-during is this to them, to their generations.
\v 8 'And unto them you sayest: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners, who sojourneth in your middle, who caused burnt-offering or sacrifice to ascend,
\v 9 and unto the opening of the tent of meeting did not bring it in to make it to Yahweh — that man had been cut off from his people.
\v 10 'And any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners, who is sojourning in your middle, who eateth any blood, I have even set My face against the person who is eating the blood, and have cut him off from the middle of his people;
\v 11 for the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar, to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood which made atonement for the soul.
\v 12 'Therefore I have said to the sons of Israel, No person among you did eat blood, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your middle did not eat blood;
\v 13 and any man of the sons of Israel, or of the sojourners, who is sojourning in your middle, who hunteth venison, beast or fowl, which is eaten — had even poured out its blood, and had covered it with dust;
\v 14 for it is the life of all flesh, its blood is for its life; and I say to the sons of Israel, Blood of any flesh ye do not eat, for the life of all flesh is its blood; any one eating it is cut off.
\v 15 And any person who eateth a carcase or torn thing, among natives or among sojourners — had both washed his garments, and had bathed with water, and had been unclean until the evening — then he had been clean;
\v 16 and if he wash not, and his flesh bathe not — then he had borne his iniquity.'
\c 18
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, I am Yahweh your God;
\v 3 according to the work of the land of Egypt in which ye have dwelt ye do not, and according to the work of the land of Canaan whither I am bringing you in, ye do not, and in their statutes ye walk not.
\v 4 My judgments ye do, and My statutes ye keep, to walk in them; I am Yahweh your God;
\v 5 and ye have kept My statutes and My judgments which man did and lived in them; I am Yahweh.
\v 6 None of you unto any relation of his flesh did draw near to uncover nakedness; I am Yahweh.
\v 7 The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you will not uncover, she is your mother; you will not uncover her nakedness.
\v 8 The nakedness of the wife of your father you will not uncover; it is the nakedness of your father.
\v 9 'The nakedness of your sister, daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, born at home or born wiyout; you will not uncover their nakedness.
\v 10 The nakedness of your son's daughter, or of your daughter's daughter: you will not uncover their nakedness; for theirs is your nakedness.
\v 11 The nakedness of a daughter of your father's wife, begotten of your father, she is your sister; you will not uncover her nakedness.
\v 12 The nakedness of a sister of your father you will not uncover; she is a relation of your father.
\v 13 The nakedness of your mother's sister you will not uncover; for she is your mother's relation.
\v 14 The nakedness of your father's brother you will not uncover; unto his wife you will not draw near; she is yours aunt.
\v 15 The nakedness of your daughter-in-law you will not uncover; she is your son's wife; you will not uncover her nakedness.
\v 16 The nakedness of your brother's wife you will not uncover; it is your brother's nakedness.
\v 17 The nakedness of a woman and her daughter you will not uncover; her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter you will not take to uncover her nakedness; they are her relations; it is wickedness.
\v 18 'And a woman unto another you will not take, to be an adversary, to uncover her nakedness beside her, in her life.
\v 19 'And unto a woman in the separation of her uncleanness you will not draw near to uncover her nakedness.
\v 20 'And unto the wife of your fellow you will not give your seed of copulation, for uncleanness with her.
\v 21 And of your seed you will not give to pass over to the Molech; nor will you pollute the name of your God; I am Yahweh.
\v 22 And with a male you will not lie as one lieth with a woman; abomination it is.
\v 23 And with any beast you will not give your copulation, for uncleanness with it; and a woman did not stand before a beast to lie down with it; confusion it is.
\v 24 'Ye are not defiled with all these, for with all these have the nations been defiled which I am sending away from before you;
\v 25 and the land is defiled, and I charge its iniquity upon it, and the land vomiteth out its inhabitants:
\v 26 and ye — ye have kept My statutes and My judgments, and do not any of all these abominations, the native and the sojourner who is sojourning in your middle,
\v 27 (for all these abominations have the men of the land done who are before you, and the land is defiled),
\v 28 and the land did not vomit you out in your defiling it, as it had vomited out the nation which is before you;
\v 29 for any one who did any of all these abominations — even the persons who are doing so, have been cut off from the middle of their people;
\v 30 and ye have kept My charge, so as not to do any of the abominable statutes which have been done before you, and ye do not defile yourselves with them; I am Yahweh your God.'
\c 19
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, Ye are holy, for holy am I, Yahweh, your God.
\v 3 Each his mother and his father ye do fear, and My sabbaths ye do keep; I am Yahweh your God.
\v 4 Ye do not turn unto the idols, and a molten god ye do not make to yourselves; I am Yahweh your God.
\v 5 'And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, at your pleasure ye do sacrifice it;
\v 6 in the day of your sacrificing it is eaten, and on the morrow, and that which is left unto the third day with fire is burnt,
\v 7 and if it be really eaten on the third day, it is an abomination, it is not pleasing,
\v 8 and he who is eating it his iniquity did bear, for the holy thing of Yahweh he had polluted, and that person had been cut off from his people.
\v 9 'And in your reaping the harvest of your land ye do not completely reap the corner of your field, and the gleaning of your harvest you will not gather,
\v 10 and your vineyard you will not glean, even the omitted part of your vineyard you will not gather, to the poor and to the sojourner you will leave them; I am Yahweh your God.
\v 11 'Ye do not steal, nor feign, nor lie one against his fellow.
\v 12 And ye do not swear by My name to falsehood, or you hast polluted the name of your God; I am Yahweh.
\v 13 'Thou will not oppress your neighbour, nor take plunder; the wages of the hireling did not remain with thee till morning.
\v 14 Thou will not revile the deaf; and before the blind you will not put a stumbling block; and you hast been afraid of your God; I am Yahweh.
\v 15 'Ye do not do perversity in judgment; you will not lift up the face of the poor, nor honour the face of the great; in righteousness you will judge your fellow.
\v 16 Thou will not go slandering among your people; you will not stand against the blood of your neighbour; I am Yahweh.
\v 17 'Thou will not hate your brother in your heart; you will certainly reprove your fellow, and not suffer sin on him.
\v 18 Thou will not take vengeance, nor watch the sons of your people; and you hast had love to your neighbour as yourself; I am Yahweh.
\v 19 My statutes ye do keep: your cattle you will not cause to gender with diverse kinds; your field you will not sow with diverse kinds, and a garment of diverse kinds, shaatnez, did not go up upon thee.
\v 20 And when a man lieth with a woman with seed of copulation, and she a maid-servant, betrothed to a man, and not really ransomed, or freedom had not been given to her, an investigation there is; they are not put to death, for she is not free.
\v 21 And he had brought in his guilt-offering to Yahweh, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt-offering,
\v 22 and the priest had made atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before Yahweh, for his sin which he had sinned, and it had been forgiven him because of his sin which he had sinned.
\v 23 And when ye come in unto the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then ye have reckoned as uncircumcised its fruit, three years it is to you uncircumcised, it is not eaten,
\v 24 and in the fourth year all its fruit is holy — praises for Yahweh.
\v 25 And in the fifth year ye do eat its fruit — to add to you its increase; I am Yahweh your God.
\v 26 'Ye do not eat with the blood; ye do not enchant, nor observe clouds.
\v 27 'Ye do not round the corner of your head, nor destroy the corner of your beard.
\v 28 And a cutting for the soul ye do not put in your flesh; and a writing, a cross-mark, ye do not put on you; I am Yahweh.
\v 29 'Thou will not pollute your daughter to cause her to go a-whoring, that the land go not a-whoring, and the land had been full of wickedness.
\v 30 My sabbaths ye do keep, and My sanctuary ye do reverence; I am Yahweh.
\v 31 Ye do not turn unto those having familiar spirits; and unto wizards ye do not seek, for uncleanness by them; I am Yahweh your God.
\v 32 At the presence of grey hairs you will rise up, and you hast honoured the presence of an old man, and hast been afraid of your God; I am Yahweh.
\v 33 'And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee in your land, you will not oppress him;
\v 34 as a native among you is the sojourner to you who is sojourning with you, and you hast had love to him as to yourself, for sojourners ye have been in the land of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God.
\v 35 'Ye do not do perversity in judgment, in mete-yard, in weight, or in liquid measure;
\v 36 righteous balances, righteous weights, a righteous ephah, and a righteous hin ye have; I am Yahweh your God, who had brought you out from the land of Egypt;
\v 37 and ye have observed all my statutes, and all my judgments, and have done them; I am Yahweh.'
\c 20
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'And unto the sons of Israel you will say, Any man of the sons of Israel, and of the sojourners who is sojourning in Israel, who gave of his seed to the Molech, is certainly put to death; the people of the land do stone him with stones;
\v 3 and I — I set My face against that man, and have cut him off from the middle of his people, for of his seed he had given to the Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary, and to pollute My holy name.
\v 4 'And if the people of the land really hide their eyes from that man, in his giving of his seed to the Molech, so as not to put him to death,
\v 5 then I have set My face against that man, and against his family, and have cut him off, and all who are going a-whoring after him, even going a-whoring after the Molech, from the middle of their people.
\v 6 'And the person who turneth unto those having familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to go a-whoring after them, I have even set My face against that person, and cut him off from the middle of his people.
\v 7 And ye have sanctified yourselves, and ye have been holy, for I am Yahweh your God;
\v 8 and ye have kept My statutes and have done them; I am Yahweh, sanctifying you.
\v 9 For any man who revileth his father and his mother is certainly put to death; his father and his mother he had reviled: his blood is on him.
\v 10 And a man who committeth adultery with a man's wife — who committeth adultery with the wife of his neighbour — the adulterer and the adulteress are surely put to death.
\v 11 And a man who lieth with his father's wife — the nakedness of his father he had uncovered — both of them are certainly put to death; their blood is on them.
\v 12 And a man who lieth with his daughter-in-law — both of them are certainly put to death; confusion they have made; their blood is on them.
\v 13 And a man who lieth with a male as one lieth with a woman; abomination both of them have done; they are certainly put to death; their blood is on them.
\v 14 And a man who taketh the woman and her mother — it is wickedness; with fire they burn him and them, and there is no wickedness in your middle.
\v 15 'And a man who gave his lying with a beast is certainly put to death, and the beast ye do slay.
\v 16 And a woman who draweth near unto any beast to lie with it — you hast even killed the woman and the beast; they are certainly put to death; their blood is on them.
\v 17 'And a man who taketh his sister, a daughter of his father or daughter of his mother, and he had seen her nakedness, and she saw his nakedness: it is a shame; and they have been cut off before the eyes of the sons of their people; the nakedness of his sister he had uncovered; his iniquity he beareth.
\v 18 And a man who lieth with a sick woman, and had uncovered her nakedness, her fountain he had made bare, and she had uncovered the fountain of her blood, — even both of them have been cut off from the middle of their people.
\v 19 'And the nakedness of your mother's sister, and of your father's sister, you will not uncover; because his relation he had made bare; their iniquity they bear.
\v 20 'And a man who lieth with his aunt, the nakedness of his uncle he had uncovered; their sin they bear; childless they die.
\v 21 And a man who taketh his brother's wife — it is impurity; the nakedness of his brother he had uncovered; childless they are.
\v 22 'And ye have kept all My statutes, and all My judgments, and have done them, and the land vomiteth you not out whither I am bringing you in to dwell in it;
\v 23 and ye walk not in the statutes of the nation which I am sending away from before you, for all these they have done, and I am wearied with them;
\v 24 and I say to you, Ye — ye do possess their ground, and I — I give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey; I am Yahweh your God, who had separated you from the peoples.
\v 25 And ye have made separation between the pure beasts and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the pure, and ye do not make yourselves abominable by beast or by fowl, or by anything which creepeth on the ground which I have separated to you for unclean;
\v 26 and ye have been holy to Me; for holy am I, Yahweh; and I separate you from the peoples to become Mine.
\v 27 And a man or woman — when there is in them a familiar spirit, or who are wizards — are certainly put to death; with stones they stone them; their blood is on them.'
\c 21
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Speak unto the priests, sons of Aaron, and you hast said unto them, For any person a priest is not defiled among his people,
\v 2 except for his relation who is near unto him — for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.
\v 3 and for his sister, the virgin, who is near unto him, who had not been to a man; for her he is defiled.
\v 4 A master priest did not defile himself among his people — to pollute himself;
\v 5 they do not make baldness on their head, and the corner of their beard they do not shave, and in their flesh they do not make a cutting;
\v 6 they are holy to their God, and they pollute not the name of their God, for the fire-offerings of Yahweh, bread of their God, they are bringing near, and have been holy.
\v 7 A woman, a harlot, or polluted, they do not take, and a woman cast out from her husband they do not take, for he is holy to his God;
\v 8 and you hast sanctified him, for the bread of your God he is bringing near; he is holy to thee; for holy am I, Yahweh, sanctifying you.
\v 9 And a daughter of any priest when she polluteth herself by going a-whoring — her father she is polluting; with fire she is burnt.
\v 10 'And the high priest of his brethren, on whose head is poured the anointing oil, and had consecrated his hand to put on the garments, his head did not uncover, nor rend his garments,
\v 11 nor beside any dead person did he come; for his father and for his mother he did not defile himself;
\v 12 nor from the sanctuary did he go out, nor did he pollute the sanctuary of his God, for the separation of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am Yahweh.
\v 13 'And he taketh a wife in her virginity;
\v 14 widow, or cast out, or polluted one — a harlot — these he did not take, but a virgin of his own people he did take for a wife,
\v 15 and he did not pollute his seed among his people; for I am Yahweh, sanctifying him.'
\v 16 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 17 'Speak unto Aaron, saying, No man of your seed to their generations in whom there is blemish did draw near to bring near the bread of his God,
\v 18 for no man in whom is blemish did draw near — a man blind, or lame or dwarfed, or enlarged,
\v 19 or a man in whom there is a breach in the foot, or a breach in the hand,
\v 20 or hump-backed, or a dwarf, or with a mixture in his eye, or a scurvy person, or scabbed, or broken-testicled.
\v 21 No man in whom is blemish (of the seed of Aaron the priest) did come nigh to bring near the fire-offerings of Yahweh; blemish is in him; the bread of his God he did not come nigh to bring near.
\v 22 Bread of his God — of the most holy things, and of the holy things — he did eat;
\v 23 only, unto the vail he did not enter, and unto the altar he did not draw nigh; for blemish is in him; and he did not pollute My sanctuaries; for I am Yahweh, sanctifying them.'
\v 24 And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel.
\c 22
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and they are separated from the holy things of the sons of Israel, and they pollute not My holy name in what they are hallowing to Me; I am Yahweh.
\v 3 Say unto them, To your generations, any man who draweth near, out of all your seed, unto the holy things which the sons of Israel do sanctify to Yahweh, and his uncleanness on him — even that person had been cut off from before Me; I am Yahweh.
\v 4 Any man of the seed of Aaron, and is leprous or had an issue — of the holy things he did not eat till that he is clean; and he who is coming against any uncleanness of a person, or a man whose seed of copulation went out from him,
\v 5 or a man who came against any teeming thing which is unclean to him, or against a man who is unclean to him, even any of his uncleanness — 
\v 6 the person who came against it — had even been unclean till the evening, and did not eat of the holy things, but had bathed his flesh with water,
\v 7 and the sun had gone in, and he had been clean, and afterwards he did eat of the holy things, for it is his food;
\v 8 a carcase or torn thing he did not eat, for uncleanness thereby; I am Yahweh.
\v 9 And they have kept My charge, and bear no sin for it, that they have died for it when they pollute it; I am Yahweh sanctifying them.
\v 10 'And no stranger did eat of the holy thing; a settler of a priest and an hireling did not eat of the holy thing;
\v 11 and when a priest buyeth a person, the purchase of his money, he did eat of it, also one born in his house; they do eat of his bread.
\v 12 And a priest's daughter, when she is a strange man's, — she, of the heave-offering of the holy things did not eat;
\v 13 and a priest's daughter, when she is a widow, or cast out, and had no seed, and had turned back unto the house of her father, as in her youth, of her father's bread she did eat; but no stranger did eat of it.
\v 14 And when a man did eat of a holy thing through ignorance, then he had added its fifth part to it, and had given it to the priest, with the holy thing;
\v 15 and they do not pollute the holy things of the sons of Israel — that which they lift up to Yahweh,
\v 16 nor have caused them to bear the iniquity of the guilt-offering in their eating their holy things; for I am Yahweh, sanctifying them.'
\v 17 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 18 'Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who brought near his offering, of all his vows, or of all his willing offerings which they bring near to Yahweh for a burnt-offering;
\v 19 at your pleasure a perfect one, a male of the herd, of the sheep or of the goats;
\v 20 nothing in which is blemish do ye bring near, for it is not for a pleasing thing for you.
\v 21 'And when a man brought near a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, to complete a vow, or for a willing-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it is perfect for a pleasing thing: no blemish is in it;
\v 22 blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed — ye do not bring these near to Yahweh, and a fire-offering ye do not make of them on the altar to Yahweh.
\v 23 As to an ox or a sheep enlarged or dwarfed — a willing-offering ye do make it, but for a vow it is not pleasing.
\v 24 As to a bruised, or beaten, or enlarged, or cut thing — ye do not bring it near to Yahweh; even in your land ye do not do it.
\v 25 And from the hand of a son of a stranger ye do not bring near the bread of your God, of any of these, for their corruption is in them; blemish is in them; they are not pleasing for you.'
\v 26 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 27 'When ox or lamb or goat is born, and it had been seven days under its dam, then from the eighth day and henceforth, it is pleasing for an offering, a fire-offering to Yahweh;
\v 28 but an ox or sheep — it and its young one, ye do not slaughter in one day.
\v 29 'And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, at your pleasure ye do sacrifice,
\v 30 on that day it is eaten, ye do not leave of it till morning; I am Yahweh;
\v 31 and ye have kept my commands, and have done them; I am Yahweh;
\v 32 and ye do not pollute My holy name, and I have been hallowed in the middle of the sons of Israel; I am Yahweh, sanctifying you,
\v 33 who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt, to become your God; I am Yahweh.'
\c 23
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, Appointed seasons of Yahweh, which ye proclaim, holy convocations, are these: they are My appointed seasons:
\v 3 six days is work done, and in the seventh day is a sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye do no work; it is a sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.
\v 4 These are appointed seasons of Yahweh, holy convocations, which ye proclaim in their appointed seasons:
\v 5 in the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings, is the passover to Yahweh;
\v 6 and on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast of unleavened things to Yahweh; seven days unleavened things ye do eat;
\v 7 on the first day ye have a holy convocation, ye do no servile work;
\v 8 and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Yahweh seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye do no servile work.'
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 10 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, and have reaped its harvest, and have brought in the sheaf, the beginning of your harvest unto the priest,
\v 11 then he had waved the sheaf before Yahweh for your acceptance; on the morrow of the sabbath did the priest wave it.
\v 12 'And ye have prepared in the day of your waving the sheaf a lamb, a perfect one, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering to Yahweh,
\v 13 and its present two tenth deals of flour mixed with oil, a fire-offering to Yahweh, a sweet fragrance, and its drink-offering, wine, a fourth of the hin.
\v 14 And bread and roasted corn and full ears ye do not eat until this self-same day, until your bringing in the offering of your God — a statute age-during to your generations, in all your dwellings.
\v 15 'And ye have numbered to you from the morrow of the sabbath, from the day of your bringing in the sheaf of the wave-offering: they are seven perfect sabbaths;
\v 16 unto the morrow of the seventh sabbath ye do number fifty days, and ye have brought near a new present to Yahweh;
\v 17 out of your dwellings ye bring in bread of a wave-offering, two loaves, of two tenth deals of flour they are, with yeast they are baken, first -fruits to Yahweh.
\v 18 'And ye have brought near, besides the bread, seven lambs, perfect ones, sons of a year, and one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams; they are a burnt-offering to Yahweh, with their present and their libations, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 19 'And ye have prepared one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs, sons of a year, for a sacrifice of peace-offerings,
\v 20 and the priest had waved them, besides the bread of the first -fruits — a wave-offering before Yahweh, besides the two lambs; they are holy to Yahweh for the priest;
\v 21 and ye have proclaimed on this self-same day: a holy convocation is to you, ye do no servile work — a statute age-during in all your dwellings, to your generations.
\v 22 And in your reaping the harvest of your land you will not complete the corner of your field in your reaping, and the gleaning of your harvest you will not gather, to the poor and to the sojourner you will leave them; I Yahweh am your God.'
\v 23 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 24 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first of the month, ye have a sabbath, a memorial of shouting, a holy convocation;
\v 25 ye do no servile work, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Yahweh.'
\v 26 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 27 Only — on the tenth of this seventh month is a day of atonements; ye have a holy convocation, and ye have humbled yourselves, and have brought near a fire-offering to Yahweh;
\v 28 and ye do no work in this self-same day, for it is a day of atonements, to make atonement for you, before Yahweh your God.
\v 29 'For any person who is not humbled in this self-same day had even been cut off from his people;
\v 30 and any person who did any work in this self-same day I have even destroyed that person from the middle of his people;
\v 31 ye do no work — a statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings.
\v 32 It is a sabbath of rest to you, and ye have humbled yourselves in the ninth of the month at even; from evening till evening ye do keep your sabbath.'
\v 33 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 34 Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month is a feast of booths seven days to Yahweh;
\v 35 on the first day is a holy convocation, ye do no servile work,
\v 36 seven days ye bring near a fire-offering to Yahweh, on the eighth day ye have a holy convocation, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Yahweh; it is a restraint, ye do no servile work.
\v 37 These are appointed seasons of Yahweh, which ye proclaim holy convocations, to bring near a fire-offering to Yahweh, a burnt-offering, and a present, a sacrifice, and libations, a thing of a day in its day,
\v 38 apart from the sabbaths of Yahweh, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your vows, and apart from all your willing-offerings, which ye give to Yahweh.
\v 39 Only — in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in your gathering the increase of the land, ye do keep the feast of Yahweh seven days; on the first day is a sabbath, and on the eighth day a sabbath;
\v 40 and ye have taken to yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of a brook, and have rejoiced before Yahweh your God seven days.
\v 41 And ye have kept it a feast to Yahweh, seven days in a year — a statute age-during to your generations; in the seventh month ye keep it a feast.
\v 42 'In booths ye dwell seven days; all who are natives in Israel dwell in booths,
\v 43 so that your generations do know that in booths I caused the sons of Israel to dwell; in my bringing them out of the land of Egypt; I, Yahweh, am your God.'
\v 44 And Moses spoke concerning the appointed seasons of Yahweh unto the sons of Israel.
\c 24
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure olive oil, beaten, for the lamp, to cause a light to go up continually;
\v 3 at the outside of the vail of the testimony in the tent of meeting did Aaron arrange it from evening till morning before Yahweh continually — a statute age-during to your generations;
\v 4 by the pure candlestick he did arrange the lights before Yahweh continually.
\v 5 'And you hast taken flour, and hast baked twelve cakes with it, two tenth deals are in the one cake,
\v 6 and you hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Yahweh,
\v 7 and you hast put on the rank pure frankincense, and it had been to the bread for a memorial, a fire-offering to Yahweh.
\v 8 On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Yahweh continually, from the sons of Israel — a covenant age-during;
\v 9 and it had been to Aaron, and to his sons, and they have eaten it in the holy place, for it is most holy to him, from the fire-offerings of Yahweh — a statute age-during.'
\v 10 And a son of an Israelitish woman went out (and he is son of an Egyptian man), in the middle of the sons of Israel, and strive in the camp do the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel,
\v 11 and the son of the Israelitish woman execrateth the Name, and revileth; and they bring him in unto Moses; and his mother's name is Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;
\v 12 and he caused him to rest in charge — to explain to them by the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 13 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 14 'Bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp; and all those hearing have laid their hands on his head, and all the company have stoned him.
\v 15 And unto the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, When any man revileth his God — then he had borne his sin;
\v 16 and he who is execrating the name of Yahweh is certainly put to death; all the company do certainly cast stones at him; as a sojourner so a native, in his execrating the Name, is put to death.
\v 17 'And when a man smiteth any soul of man, he is certainly put to death.
\v 18 'And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, body for body.
\v 19 'And when a man putteth a blemish in his fellow, as he had done so it is done to him;
\v 20 breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he putteth a blemish in a man so it is done in him.
\v 21 And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, and he who smiteth the life of man is put to death;
\v 22 one judgment is to you; as a sojourner so is a native; for I am Yahweh your God.'
\v 23 And Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel, and they bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the sons of Israel have done as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\c 25
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, in mount Sinai, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, then had the land kept a sabbath to Yahweh.
\v 3 'Six years you will sow your field, and six years you will prune your vineyard, and hast gathered its increase,
\v 4 and in the seventh year a sabbath of rest is to the land, a sabbath to Yahweh; your field you will not sow, and your vineyard you will not prune;
\v 5 the spontaneous growth of your harvest you will not reap, and the grapes of your separated thing you will not gather, a year of rest it is to the land.
\v 6 'And the sabbath of the land had been to you for food, to thee, and to your man-servant, and to your handmaid, and to your hireling, and to your settler, who are sojourning with thee;
\v 7 and to your cattle, and to the beast which is in your land, is all yours increase for food.
\v 8 'And you hast numbered to thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times, and the days of the seven sabbaths of years have been to thee nine and forty years,
\v 9 and you hast caused a trumpet of shouting to pass over in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month; in the day of the atonements ye do cause a trumpet to pass over through all your land;
\v 10 and ye have hallowed the year, the fiftieth year; and ye have proclaimed liberty in the land to all its inhabitants; a jubilee it is to you; and ye have turned back each unto his possession; yea, each unto his family ye do turn back.
\v 11 A jubilee it is, the fiftieth year, a year it is to you; ye sow not, nor reap its spontaneous growth, nor gather its separated things;
\v 12 for a jubilee it is, holy it is to you; out of the field ye eat its increase;
\v 13 in the year of this jubilee ye turn back each unto his possession.
\v 14 'And when you sellest anything to your fellow, or buyest from the hand of your fellow, ye do not oppress one another;
\v 15 by the number of years after the jubilee you will buy from your fellow; by the number of the years of increase he did sell to thee;
\v 16 according to the multitude of the years you will multiply its price, and according to the fewness of the years you will diminish its price; for a number of increases he is selling to thee;
\v 17 and ye do not oppress one another, and you hast been afraid of your God; for I am Yahweh your God.
\v 18 'And ye have done My statutes, and My judgments ye keep, and have done them, and ye have dwelt on the land confidently,
\v 19 and the land had given its fruit, and ye have eaten to satiety, and have dwelt confidently on it.
\v 20 'And when ye say, What do we eat in the seventh year, lo, we do not sow, nor gather our increase?
\v 21 then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it had made the increase for three years;
\v 22 and ye have sown the eighth year, and have eaten of the old increase; until the ninth year, until the coming in of its increase, ye do eat the old.
\v 23 And the land is not sold — to extinction, for the land is Mine, for sojourners and settlers are ye with Me;
\v 24 and in all the land of your possession a redemption ye do give to the land.
\v 25 'When your brother became poor, and had sold his possession, then had his redeemer who is near unto him come, and he had redeemed the sold thing of his brother;
\v 26 and when a man had no redeemer, and his own hand had attained, and he had found as sufficient for its redemption,
\v 27 then he had reckoned the years of its sale, and had given back that which is over to the man to whom he sold it, and he had returned to his possession.
\v 28 'And if his hand had not found sufficiency to give back to him, then had his sold thing been in the hand of him who buyeth it till the year of jubilee; and it had gone out in the jubilee, and he had returned to his possession.
\v 29 And when a man selleth a dwelling-house in a walled city, then had his right of redemption been until the completion of a year from its selling; days — is his right of redemption;
\v 30 and if it is not redeemed until the fulness to him of a perfect year, then had the house which is in a walled city been established to extinction to the buyer of it, to his generations; it went not out in the jubilee;
\v 31 and a house of the villages which have no wall round about, on the field of the country is reckoned; redemption is to it, and in the jubilee it went out.
\v 32 As to cities of the Levites — houses of the cities of their possession — redemption age-during is to the Levites;
\v 33 as to him who redeemeth from the Levites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession have gone out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the middle of the sons of Israel.
\v 34 And a field, a suburb of their cities, is not sold; for a possession age-during it is to them.
\v 35 'And when your brother is become poor, and his hand had failed with thee, then you hast kept hold on him, sojourner and settler, and he had lived with thee;
\v 36 you takest no usury from him, or increase; and you hast been afraid of your God; and your brother had lived with thee;
\v 37 your money you givest not to him in usury, and for increase you givest not your food;
\v 38 I am Yahweh your God, who had brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to become your God.
\v 39 'And when your brother became poor with thee, and he had been sold to thee, you will not lay on him servile service;
\v 40 as an hireling, as a settler, he is with thee, till the year of the jubilee he did serve with thee, — 
\v 41 then he had gone out from thee, he and his sons with him, and had turned back unto his family; even unto the possession of his fathers he did turn back.
\v 42 For they are My servants, whom I have brought out from the land of Egypt: they are not sold with the sale of a servant;
\v 43 you rulest not over him with rigour, and you hast been afraid of your God.
\v 44 And your man-servant and your handmaid whom you hast are of the nations who are round about you; of them ye buy man-servant and handmaid,
\v 45 and also of the sons of the settlers who are sojourning with you, of them ye buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they have been to you for a possession;
\v 46 and ye have taken them for inheritance to your sons after you, to occupy for a possession; to the age ye lay service upon them, but upon your brethren, the sons of Israel, one with another, you will not rule over him with rigour.
\v 47 And when the hand of a sojourner or settler with thee attaineth riches, and your brother with him had become poor, and he had been sold to a sojourner, a settler with thee, or to the root of the family of a sojourner,
\v 48 after he had been sold, there is a right of redemption to him; one of his brethren did redeem him,
\v 49 or his uncle, or a son of his uncle, did redeem him, or any of the relations of his flesh, of his family, did redeem him, or — his own hand had attained — then he had been redeemed.
\v 50 'And he had reckoned with his buyer from the year of his being sold to him till the year of jubilee, and the money of his sale had been by the number of years; as the days of an hireling it is with him.
\v 51 If yet many years, according to them he gave back his redemption money, from the money of his purchase.
\v 52 And if few are left of the years till the year of jubilee, then he had reckoned with him, according to his years he did give back his redemption money;
\v 53 as an hireling, year by year, he is with him, and he did not rule him with rigour before yours eyes.
\v 54 And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he had gone out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.
\v 55 For to Me are the sons of Israel servants; My servants they are, whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt; I, Yahweh, am your God.
\c 26
\v 1 Ye do not make to yourselves idols; and graven image or standing image ye do not set up to yourselves; and a stone of imagery ye do not put in your land, to bow yourselves to it; for I am Yahweh your God.
\v 2 My sabbaths ye do keep, and My sanctuary ye do reverence; I am Yahweh.
\v 3 'If in My statutes ye walk, and My commands ye keep, and have done them,
\v 4 then I have given your rains in their season, and the land had given her produce, and the tree of the field did give its fruit;
\v 5 and reached to you had the threshing, the gathering, and the gathering did reach the sowing -time; and ye have eaten your bread to satiety, and have dwelt confidently in your land.
\v 6 'And I have given peace in the land, and ye have lain down, and there is none causing trembling; and I have caused evil beasts to cease out of the land, and the sword did not pass over into your land.
\v 7 'And ye have pursued your enemies, and they have fallen before you by the sword;
\v 8 and five of you have pursued a hundred, and a hundred of you do pursue a myriad; and your enemies have fallen before you by the sword.
\v 9 'And I have turned unto you, and have made you fruitful, and have multiplied you, and have established My covenant with you;
\v 10 and ye have eaten old store, and the old because of the new ye bring out.
\v 11 'And I have given My tabernacle in your middle, and My soul did not loathe you;
\v 12 and I have walked habitually in your middle, and have become your God, and ye — ye are become My people;
\v 13 I am Yahweh your God, who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians, from being their servants; and I break the bars of your yoke, and cause you to go erect.
\v 14 'And if ye do not hearken to Me, and do not all these commands;
\v 15 and if at My statutes ye kick, and if My judgments your soul loathe, so as not to do all My commands — to your breaking My covenant — 
\v 16 I also do this to you, and I have appointed over you trouble, the consumption, and the burning fever, consuming eyes, and causing pain of soul; and your seed in vain ye have sowed, and your enemies have eaten it;
\v 17 and I have set My face against you, and ye have been smitten before your enemies; and those hating you have ruled over you, and ye have fled, and there is none pursuing you.
\v 18 And if unto these ye hearken not to Me, — then I have added to chastise you seven times for your sins;
\v 19 and I have broken the pride of your strength, and have made your heavens as iron, and your earth as brass;
\v 20 and consumed had been your strength in vain, and your land did not give her produce, and the tree of the land did not give its fruit.
\v 21 And if ye walk with Me in opposition, and are not willing to hearken to Me, then I have added to you a plague seven times, according to your sins,
\v 22 and sent against you the beast of the field, and it had bereaved you; and I have cut off your cattle, and have made you few, and your ways have been desolate.
\v 23 And if by these ye are not instructed by Me, and have walked with Me in opposition,
\v 24 then I have walked — I also — with you in opposition, and have smitten you, even I, seven times for your sins;
\v 25 and I have brought in on you a sword, executing the vengeance of a covenant; and ye have been gathered unto your cities, and I have sent pestilence into your middle, and ye have been given into the hand of an enemy.
\v 26 'In My breaking to you the staff of bread, then ten women have baked your bread in one oven, and have given back your bread by weight; and ye have eaten, and are not satisfied.
\v 27 'And if for this ye hearken not to Me, and have walked with Me in opposition,
\v 28 then I have walked with you in the fury of opposition, and have chastised you, even I, seven times for your sins.
\v 29 'And ye have eaten the flesh of your sons; even flesh of your daughters ye do eat.
\v 30 And I have destroyed your high places, and cut down your images, and have put your carcases on the carcases of your idols, and My soul had loathed you;
\v 31 and I have made your cities a waste, and have made desolate your sanctuaries, and I smell not at your sweet fragrances;
\v 32 and I have made desolate the land, and your enemies, who are dwelling in it, have been astonished at it.
\v 33 And you I scatter among nations, and have drawn out after you a sword, and your land had been a desolation, and your cities are a waste.
\v 34 Then did the land enjoy its sabbaths — all the days of the desolation, and ye in the land of your enemies — then did the land rest, and had enjoyed its sabbaths;
\v 35 all the days of the desolation it rested that which it had not rested in your sabbaths in your dwelling on it.
\v 36 And those who are left of you — I have also brought a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a leaf driven away had pursued them, and they have fled — flight from a sword — and they have fallen, and there is none pursuing.
\v 37 And they have stumbled one on another, as from the face of a sword, and there is none pursuing, and ye have no standing before your enemies,
\v 38 and ye have perished among the nations, and the land of your enemies had consumed you.
\v 39 And those who are left of you — they consume away in their iniquity, in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers, with them they consume away.
\v 40 And — they have confessed their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they have trespassed against Me, and also, that they have walked with Me, in opposition,
\v 41 also I walk to them in opposition, and have brought them into the land of their enemies — or then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity, — 
\v 42 then I have remembered My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham I remember, and the land I remember.
\v 43 And — the land is left of them, and did enjoy its sabbaths, in the desolation wiyout them, and they accept the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because, against My judgments they have kicked, and My statutes had their soul loathed,
\v 44 and also even this, in their being in the land of their enemies, I have not rejected them, nor have I loathed them, to consume them, to break My covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God; — 
\v 45 then I have remembered for them the covenant of the ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to become their God; I am Yahweh.'
\v 46 These are the statutes, and the judgments, and the laws, which Yahweh had given between Him and the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
\c 27
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When a man made a wonderful vow, by your valuation the persons are Yahweh's.
\v 3 When your valuation had been of the male from a son of twenty years even unto a son of sixty years, then had been your valuation fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary.
\v 4 And if it is a female — then had your valuation been thirty shekels;
\v 5 and if from a son of five years even unto a son of twenty years — then had your valuation been of the male twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels;
\v 6 and if from a son of a month even unto a son of five years — then had your valuation been of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation is three shekels of silver;
\v 7 and if from a son of sixty years and above — if a male, then had your valuation been fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
\v 8 'And if he is poorer than your valuation, then he had presented himself before the priest, and the priest had valued him; according to that which the hand of him who is vowing did reach did the priest value him.
\v 9 And if it is a beast of which they bring near an offering to Yahweh, all that one gave of it to Yahweh is holy;
\v 10 he did not change it nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he really change beast for beast, — then it had been — it and its exchange is holy.
\v 11 And if it is any unclean beast of which they do not bring near an offering to Yahweh, then he had presented the beast before the priest,
\v 12 and the priest had valued it; whether good or bad, according to your valuation, O priest, so it is;
\v 13 and if he really redeem it, then he had added its fifth to your valuation.
\v 14 'And when a man sanctifieth his house, a holy thing to Yahweh, then had the priest valued it, whether good or bad; as the priest did value it so it standeth;
\v 15 and if he who is sanctifying did redeem his house, then he had added a fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it had become his.
\v 16 'And if of the field of his possession a man sanctify to Yahweh, then had your valuation been according to its seed; a homer of barley-seed at fifty shekels of silver;
\v 17 if from the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to your valuation it standeth;
\v 18 and if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then had the priest reckoned to him the money according to the years which are left, unto the year of the jubilee, and it had been abated from your valuation.
\v 19 And if he really redeem the field — he who is sanctifying it — then he had added a fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it had been established to him;
\v 20 and if he do not redeem the field, or if he had sold the field to another man, it is not redeemed any more;
\v 21 and the field had been, in its going out in the jubilee, holy to Yahweh as a field which is devoted; to the priest is its possession.
\v 22 And if the field of his purchase (which is not of the fields of his possession) one sanctify to Yahweh — 
\v 23 then had the priest reckoned to him the amount of your valuation unto the year of jubilee, and he had given your valuation in that day — a holy thing to Yahweh;
\v 24 in the year of the jubilee the field returneth to him from whom he bought it, to him whose is the possession of the land.
\v 25 And all your valuation is by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs is the shekel.
\v 26 Only, a firstling which is Yahweh's firstling among beasts — no man did sanctify it, whether ox or sheep; it is Yahweh's.
\v 27 And if among the unclean beasts, then he had ransomed it at your valuation, and he had added its fifth to it; and if it is not redeemed, then it had been sold at your valuation.
\v 28 'Only, no devoted thing which a man devoteth to Yahweh, of all that he had, of man, and beast, and of the field of his possession, is sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.
\v 29 'No devoted thing, which is devoted of man, is ransomed, it is surely put to death.
\v 30 And all tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh's — holy to Yahweh.
\v 31 And if a man really redeem any of his tithe, its fifth he addeth to it.
\v 32 And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock — all that passeth by under the rod — the tenth is holy to Yahweh;
\v 33 he enquireth not between good and bad, nor did he change it; and if he really change it — then it had been — it and its exchange is holy; it is not redeemed.'
\v 34 These are the commands which Yahweh had commanded Moses for the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai.
