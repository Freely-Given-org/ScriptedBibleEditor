\v 1 And strengthen himself did Solomon son of David over his kingdom, and Yahweh his God is with him, and made him exceedingly great.
\v 2 And Solomon said to all Israel, to heads of the yousands, and of the hundreds, and to judges, and to every honourable one of all Israel, heads of the fathers,
\v 3 and they go — Solomon, and all the assembly with him — to the high place that is in Gibeon, for there had been God's tent of meeting, that Moses, servant of Yahweh, made in the wilderness,
\v 4 but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim, when David prepared for it, for he stretched out for it a tent in Jerusalem;
\v 5 and the altar of brass that Bezaleel son of Uri, son of Hur made, he put before the tabernacle of Yahweh; and Solomon and the assembly seek to it.
\v 6 And Solomon went up thither, on the altar of brass, before Yahweh, that is at the tent of meeting, and caused to ascend upon it a yousand burnt-offerings.
\v 7 In that night had God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, 'Ask — what do I give to thee?'
\v 8 And Solomon said to God, 'Thou hast done with David my father great kindness, and hast caused me to reign in his stead.
\v 9 Now, O Yahweh God, is Your word with David my father stedfast, for Thou hast caused me to reign over a people numerous as the dust of the earth;
\v 10 now, wisdom and knowledge give to me, and I go out before this people, and I come in, for who did judge this Your great people?'
\v 11 And God said to Solomon, 'Because that this had been with your heart, and you hast not asked riches, wealth, and honour, and the life of those hating thee, and also many days hast not asked, and will ask for yourself wisdom and knowledge, so that you will judge My people over which I have caused thee to reign — 
\v 12 the wisdom and the knowledge is given to thee, and riches and wealth and honour I give to thee, that there had not been so to the kings who are before thee, and after thee it is not so.'
\v 13 And Solomon came in from the high place that is in Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigneth over Israel,
\v 14 and Solomon gathereth chariots and horsemen, and he had a yousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve yousand horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.
\v 15 And the king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he made as sycamores that are in the low country, for abundance.
\v 16 And the source of the horses that are to Solomon is from Egypt and from Keva; merchants of the king from Keva take at a price,
\v 17 and they come up, and bring out from Egypt a chariot for six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred, and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram — by their hand they bring out.
\c 2
\v 1 And Solomon said to build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom,
\v 2 and Solomon numbereth seventy yousand men bearing burden, and eighty yousand men hewing in the mountain, and overseers over them — three yousand and six hundred.
\v 3 And Solomon sent unto Huram king of Tyre, saying, 'When you hast dealt with David my father, then you will send to him cedars to build for him a house to dwell in;
\v 4 lo, I am building a house to the name of Yahweh my God, to sanctify it to Him, to make perfume before Him, perfume of spices, and a continual arrangement, and burnt-offerings at morning and at evening, at sabbaths, and at new moons, and at appointed seasons of Yahweh our God; to the age this is on Israel.
\v 5 And the house that I am building is great, for greater is our God than all gods;
\v 6 and who did retain strength to build to Him a house, for the heavens, even the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Him? and who am I that I do build to Him a house, except to make perfume before Him?
\v 7 And now, send to me a wise man to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and knowing to grave gravings with the wise men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father prepared;
\v 8 and send to me cedar-trees, firs, and algums from Lebanon, for I have known that your servants know to cut down trees of Lebanon, and lo, my servants are with your servants,
\v 9 even to prepare for me trees in abundance, for the house that I am building is great and wonderful.
\v 10 'And lo, to hewers, to those cutting the trees, I have given beaten wheat to your servants, cors twenty yousand, and barley, cors twenty yousand, and wine, baths twenty yousand, and oil, baths twenty yousand.'
\v 11 And Huram king of Tyre said in writing, and sent unto Solomon: 'In the love of Yahweh to His people He had given thee king over them.'
\v 12 And Huram said, 'Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, who had given to David the king a wise son, knowing wisdom and understanding, who did build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.
\v 13 'And now, I have sent a wise man having understanding, of Huram my father,
\v 14 (son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre), knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stones, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, and to grave any graving, and to devise any device that is given to him, with your wise men, and the wise men of my lord David your father.
\v 15 'And, now, the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, as my lord said, let him send to his servants,
\v 16 and we — we cut trees out of Lebanon, according to all your need, and bring them in to thee — floats by sea, to Joppa, and you will take them up to Jerusalem.'
\v 17 And Solomon numbereth all the men, the sojourners who are in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them, and they are found a hundred and fifty yousand, and three yousand, and six hundred;
\v 18 and he made of them seventy yousand burden-bearers, and eighty yousand hewers in the mountain, and three yousand and six hundred overseers, to cause the people to work.
\c 3
\v 1 And Solomon beginneth to build the house of Yahweh, in Jerusalem, in the mount of Moriah, where He appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
\v 2 and he beginneth to build in the second day, in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
\v 3 And in these had Solomon been instructed to build the house of God: The length in cubits by the former measure is sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\v 4 As to the porch that is on the front, the length is by the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty, and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
\v 5 And the large house he had covered with fir-trees, and he did cover it with good gold, and caused to ascend on it palms and chains,
\v 6 and he overlaid the house with precious stone for beauty, and the gold is gold of Parvaim,
\v 7 and he covereth the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold, and had graved cherubs on the walls.
\v 8 And he made the most holy house: its length is by the front of the breadth of the house twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and he covereth it with good gold, to six hundred talents;
\v 9 and the weight of the nails is fifty shekels of gold, and the upper chambers he had covered with gold.
\v 10 And he made in the most holy house two cherubs, image work, and he overlaid them with gold;
\v 11 as to the wings of the cherubs, their length is twenty cubits, the wing of the one is five cubits, touching the wall of the house, and the other wing is five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.
\v 12 And the wing of the other cherub is five cubits touching the wall of the house, and the other wing is five cubits, adhering to the wing of the other cherub.
\v 13 The wings of these cherubs are spreading forth twenty cubits, and they are standing on their feet and their faces are inward.
\v 14 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and caused cherubs to go up on it.
\v 15 And he made at the front of the house two pillars, thirty and five cubits in length, and the ornament that is on their heads five cubits.
\v 16 And he made chains in the oracle, and putteth on the heads of the pillars, and made a hundred pomegranates, and putteth on the chains.
\v 17 And he raiseth up the pillars on the front of the temple, one on the right, and one on the left, and called the name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
\c 4
\v 1 And he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.
\v 2 And he made the molten sea; ten by the cubit, from its edge unto its edge, round in compass, and five by the cubit its height, and a line of thirty by the cubit did compass it, round about.
\v 3 And the likeness of oxen is under it, all round about encompassing it, ten in the cubit, compassing the sea round about; two rows of oxen are cast in its being cast.
\v 4 It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east, and the sea is upon them above, and all their hinder parts are within.
\v 5 And its thickness is a handbreadth, and its lip as the work of the lip of a cup flowered with lilies; taking hold — baths three yousand it containeth.
\v 6 And he made ten lavers, and putteth five on the right, and five on the left, to wash with them; the work of the burnt-offering they purge with them; and the sea is for priests to wash with.
\v 7 And he made the ten candlesticks of gold, according to their ordinance, and placeth in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.
\v 8 And he made ten tables, and placeth in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left; and he made bowls of gold a hundred.
\v 9 And he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and their doors he had overlaid with brass.
\v 10 And the sea he had placed on the right shoulder eastward, over-against the south.
\v 11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls, and Huram finisheth to make the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God;
\v 12 two pillars, and the bowls, and the crowns on the heads of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of the crowns that are on the heads of the pillars;
\v 13 and the pomegranates four hundred to the two wreaths, two rows of pomegranates to the one wreath, to cover the two bowls of the crowns that are on the front of the pillars.
\v 14 And the bases he had made; and the lavers he had made on the bases;
\v 15 the one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,
\v 16 and the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their vessels, had Huram his father made for king Solomon, for the house of Yahweh, of brass purified.
\v 17 In the circuit of the Jordan had the king cast them, in the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.
\v 18 And Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, that the weight of the brass had not been searched out.
\v 19 And Solomon made all the vessels that are for the house of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables, and on them is bread of the presence;
\v 20 and the candlesticks, and their lamps, for their burning according to the ordinance, before the oracle, of gold refined;
\v 21 and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold — it is the perfection of gold;
\v 22 and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the censers, of gold refined, and the opening of the house, its innermost doors to the holy of holies, and the doors of the house to the temple, of gold.
\c 5
\v 1 And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Yahweh is finished, and Solomon brought in the sanctified things of David his father, and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he had put among the treasures of the house of God.
\v 2 Then did Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David — it is Zion.
\v 3 And assembled unto the king are all the men of Israel in the feast — it is the seventh month;
\v 4 and all the elders of Israel come in, and the Levites lift up the ark,
\v 5 and they bring up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the vessels of the sanctuary that are in the tent; brought them up have the priests, the Levites;
\v 6 and king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are convened unto him before the ark are sacrificing sheep and oxen, that are not counted nor numbered from multitude.
\v 7 And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;
\v 8 and the cherubs are spreading out wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its staves, from above;
\v 9 and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves are seen out of the ark on the front of the oracle, and they are not seen wiyout; and it is there unto this day.
\v 10 There is nothing in the ark but the two tables that Moses gave in Horeb, where Yahweh covenanted with the sons of Israel, in their going out from Egypt.
\v 11 And it came to pass, in the going out of the priests from the sanctuary — for all the priests who are present have sanctified themselves, there is none to watch by courses,
\v 12 and the Levites, the singers, to all of them, to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brethren, clothed in white linen, with cymbals, and with psalteries, and harps, are standing on the east of the altar, and with them priests, to a hundred and twenty, blowing with trumpets — 
\v 13 yea, it came to pass, as one are trumpeters and singers, to sound — one voice — to praise and to give thanks to Yahweh, and at the lifting up of the sound with trumpets, and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and at giving praise to Yahweh, for good, for to the age is His kindness, that the house is filled with a cloud — the house of Yahweh,
\v 14 and the priests have not been able to stand to minister from the presence of the cloud, for the honour of Yahweh had filled the house of God.
\c 6
\v 1 Then said Solomon, 'Yahweh said — to dwell in thick darkness,
\v 2 and I — I have built a house of habitation for Thee, and a fixed place for Your dwelling to the ages.'
\v 3 And the king turneth round his face, and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, and the whole assembly of Israel is standing,
\v 4 and he said, 'Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, who had spoken with His mouth with David my father, and with His hands had fulfilled it, saying:
\v 5 'From the day that I brought out My people from the land of Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of any of the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name being there, and I have not fixed on a man to be leader over My people Israel;
\v 6 and I fix on Jerusalem for My name being there, and I fix on David to be over My people Israel.
\v 7 'And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh God of Israel,
\v 8 and Yahweh said unto David my father, Because that it had been with your heart to build a house for My name, you hast done well that it had been with your heart,
\v 9 but you will not build the house, for your son who came forth out from your loins, he did build the house for My name.
\v 10 'And Yahweh did establish His word that He spake, and I rise up in the stead of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh spake, and I build the house for the name of Yahweh, God of Israel,
\v 11 and I place there the ark, where is the covenant of Yahweh that He made with the sons of Israel.'
\v 12 And he standeth before the altar of Yahweh, over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth out his hand, — 
\v 13 for Solomon had made a scaffold of brass, and putteth it in the middle of the court, five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height, and he standeth upon it, and kneeleth on his knees over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth forth his hands towards the heavens — 
\v 14 and said, 'O Yahweh God of Israel, there is not like Thee a god in the heavens and in the earth, keeping the covenant and the kindness for Your servants who are walking before Thee with all their heart;
\v 15 who hast kept for Your servant David my father that which Thou did speak to him; yea, Thou will speak with Your mouth, and with Your hand hast fulfilled it, as at this day.
\v 16 'And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father that which Thou did speak to him, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel, only, if your sons watch their way to walk in My law, as you hast walked before Me.
\v 17 'And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, is Your word stedfast that Thou hast spoken to Your servant, to David,
\v 18 (for is it true? — God dwelleth with man on the earth! Lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Thee, how much less this house that I have built?)
\v 19 'And Thou hast turned unto the prayer of Your servant, and unto his supplication, O Yahweh my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer that Your servant is praying before Thee,
\v 20 for Thine eyes being open towards this house by day and by night, towards the place that Thou hast said to put Your name there, to hearken unto the prayer that Your servant prayeth towards this place.
\v 21 'And Thou hast hearkened unto the supplications of Your servant, and of Your people Israel, that they pray towards this place, and Thou will hear from the place of Your dwelling, from the heavens, and hast hearkened, and forgiven.
\v 22 If a man did sin against his neighbour, and he had lifted up on him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath had come in before Thine altar in this house — 
\v 23 then Thou will hear from the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Your servants, to give back to the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness.
\v 24 And if Your people Israel is smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back and confessed Your name, and prayed and made supplication before Thee in this house — 
\v 25 then Thou will hear from the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Your people Israel, and caused them to turn back unto the ground that Thou hast given to them, and to their fathers.
\v 26 In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Your name — from their sin they turn back because Thou will afflict them — 
\v 27 then Thou will hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Your servants, and of Your people Israel, because Thou directest them unto the good way in which they walk, and hast given rain on Your land that Thou hast given to Your people for an inheritance.
\v 28 Famine, when it is in the land, pestilence, when it is, blasting, and mildew, locust, and caterpillar, when they are, when its enemies have distressed it in the land — its gates, any plague and any sickness;
\v 29 any prayer, any supplication that is for any man, and for all Your people Israel, when they know each his own plague, and his own pain, and he had spread out his hands towards this house:
\v 30 then Thou will hear from the heavens, the settled place of Your dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast given to each according to all his ways (because Thou knowest his heart, for Thou — Thou only — hast known the heart of the sons of men),
\v 31 so that they fear Thee, to walk in Your ways, all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers.
\v 32 'And also, unto the stranger who is not of Your people Israel, and he had come from a land afar off for the sake of Your great name, and Your strong hand, and Your stretched-out arm, and they have come in and prayed towards this house:
\v 33 then Thou will hear from the heavens, from the settled place of Your dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger called unto Thee for: so that all the peoples of the earth do know Your name, so as to fear Thee, as Your people Israel, and to know that Your name is called on this house that I have built.
\v 34 'When Your people did go out to battle against its enemies in the way that Thou will send them, and they have prayed unto Thee the way of this city that Thou hast fixed on, and the house that I have built for Your name:
\v 35 then Thou hast heard from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause.
\v 36 When they sin against Thee — for there is not a man who sinneth not — and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them before an enemy, and taken them captive have their captors, unto a land far off or near;
\v 37 and they have turned it back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have done wickedly;
\v 38 yea, they have turned back unto Thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, whither they have taken them captive, and they have prayed the way of their land that Thou hast given to their fathers, and of the city that Thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built for Your name:
\v 39 then Thou hast heard from the heavens, from the settled place of Your dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and hast maintained their cause, and forgiven Your people who have sinned against Thee.
\v 40 'Now, my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and Thine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place:
\v 41 and now, rise, O Yahweh God, to Your rest, Thou, and the ark of Your strength; Your priests, O Yahweh God, are clothed with salvation, and Your saints rejoice in the goodness,
\v 42 O Yahweh God, turn not back the face of Thine anointed, be mindful of the kind acts of David Your servant.'
\c 7
\v 1 And at Solomon's finishing to pray, then the fire had come down from the heavens, and consumeth the burnt-offering and the sacrifices, and the honour of Yahweh had filled the house,
\v 2 and the priests have not been able to go in unto the house of Yahweh, because the honour of Yahweh had filled the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 And all the sons of Israel are looking on the descending of the fire, and the honour of Yahweh on the house, and they bow — faces to the earth — on the pavement, and do obeisance, and give thanks to Yahweh, for good, for to the age is His kindness.
\v 4 And the king and all the people are sacrificing a sacrifice before Yahweh,
\v 5 and king Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of the herd, twenty and two yousand, and of the flock, a hundred and twenty yousand, and the king and all the people dedicate the house of God.
\v 6 And the priests over their charges are standing, and the Levites with instruments of the song of Yahweh — that David the king made, to give thanks to Yahweh, for to the age is His kindness, in David's praising by their hand — and the priests are blowing trumpets over-against them, and all Israel are standing.
\v 7 And Solomon sanctifieth the middle of the court that is before the house of Yahweh, for he had made there the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: for the altar of brass that Solomon made had not been able to contain the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat.
\v 8 And solomon made the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him — a very great assembly — from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.
\v 9 And they make on the eighth day a restraint, because the dedication of the altar they have made seven days, and the feast seven days.
\v 10 And on the twenty and third day of the seventh month he had sent the people to their tents, rejoicing, and glad in heart, for the goodness that Yahweh had done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel His people.
\v 11 And Solomon finisheth the house of Yahweh, and the house of the king; and all that had come on the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Yahweh, and in his own house, he had caused to prosper.
\v 12 And Yahweh appeareth unto Solomon by night, and said to him, 'I have heard your prayer, and have fixed on this place to Me for a house of sacrifice.
\v 13 If I restrain the heavens and there is no rain, and if I lay charge on the locust to consume the land, and if I send pestilence among My people — 
\v 14 and My people on whom My name is called be humbled, and pray, and seek My face, and turn back from their evil ways, then I — I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin, and heal their land.
\v 15 'Now, Mine eyes are open, and Mine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place;
\v 16 and now, I have chosen and sanctified this house for My name being there unto the age; yea, Mine eyes and My heart have been there all the days.
\v 17 And you, if you will walk before Me as David your father walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and My statutes and My judgments will keep — 
\v 18 then I have established the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, There is not cut off a man to thee — a ruler in Israel;
\v 19 and if ye turn back — ye — and have forsaken My statutes, and My commands, that I have placed before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them — then I have plucked them from off My ground that I have given to them,
\v 20 and this house that I have sanctified for My name, I cast from before My face, and make it for a proverb, and for a byword, among all the peoples.
\v 21 'And this house that had been high, to every one passing by it, is an astonishment, and he had said, Wherefore had Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
\v 22 and they have said, Because that they have forsaken Yahweh, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and lay hold on other gods, and bow themselves to them, and serve them, therefore He had brought upon them all this evil.'
\c 8
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the end of twenty years, that Solomon had built the house of Yahweh, and his own house.
\v 2 As to the cities that Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon had built them, and there he caused the sons of Israel to dwell.
\v 3 And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah, and laid hold upon it;
\v 4 and he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the cities of store that he had built in Hamath.
\v 5 And he built Beth-Horon the upper, and Beth-Horon the lower — cities of defence, with walls, two-leaved doors, and bar — 
\v 6 and Baalath, and all the cities of store that Solomon had, and all the cities of the chariot, and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\v 7 All the people who are left of the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are not of Israel — 
\v 8 of their sons who have been left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel consumed not — did Solomon lift up a tribute unto this day.
\v 9 And none of the sons of Israel had Solomon made servants for his work, but they are men of war, and heads of his captains, and heads of his charioteers, and of his horsemen;
\v 10 and these are heads of the officers whom king Solomon had, two hundred and fifty who are rulers among the people.
\v 11 And the daughter of Pharaoh had Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house that he built for her, for he said, 'My wife did not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for they are holy unto whom had come the ark of Yahweh.'
\v 12 Then had Solomon caused to ascend burnt-offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh that he built before the porch,
\v 13 even by the matter of a day in its day, to cause to ascend according to the command of Moses, on sabbaths, and on new moons, and on appointed seasons, three times in a year — in the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths.
\v 14 And he establisheth, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests over their service, and of the Levites over their charges, to praise and to minister over-against the priests, according to the matter of a day in its day, and the gatekeepers in their courses at gate and gate, for so is the command of David the man of God.
\v 15 And they have not turned aside from the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites, in reference to any matter, and to the treasures.
\v 16 And all the work of Solomon is prepared till the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and till its completion; perfect is the house of Yahweh.
\v 17 Then had Solomon gone to Ezion-Geber, and unto Elath, on the border of the sea, in the land of Edom;
\v 18 and Huram sent to him, by the hand of his servants, ships and servants knowing the sea, and they go with servants of Solomon to Ophir, and take there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and bring in unto king Solomon.
\c 9
\v 1 And the queen of Sheba had heard of the fame of Solomon, and came in to try Solomon with acute sayings, to Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels bearing spices and gold in abundance, and precious stone; and she came in unto Solomon, and spoke with him all that had been with her heart,
\v 2 and Solomon declareth to her all her matters, and there had not been hid a thing from Solomon that he had not declared to her.
\v 3 And the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\v 4 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his stewards, and their clothing, an his burnt-offering that he offered up in the house of Yahweh, and there had not been any more spirit in her.
\v 5 And she said unto the king, 'True is the word that I heard in my land concerning your matters and concerning your wisdom,
\v 6 and I have given no credence to their words, till that I have come, and mine eyes see, and lo, there had not been declared to me the half of the abundance of your wisdom — you hast added unto the report that I heard.
\v 7 O the happiness of your men, and the happiness of your servants — these — who are standing before thee continually, and hearing your wisdom.
\v 8 Let Yahweh your God be blessed who had delighted in thee, to put thee on His throne for king for Yahweh your God; in the love of your God to Israel, to establish it to the age, He had put thee over them for king, to do judgment and righteousness.'
\v 9 And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stone; and there had not been any such spice as the queen of Sheba had given to king Solomon.
\v 10 And also, servants of Huram, and servants of Solomon, who brought in gold from Ophir, have brought in algum-trees and precious stone.
\v 11 And the king made the algum-trees staircases for the house of Yahweh, and for the house of the king, and harps and psalteries for singers; and there have been none seen like these before in the land of Judah.
\v 12 And king Solomon had given to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, apart from that which she had brought unto the king, and she turneth and went to her land, she and her servants.
\v 13 And the weight of the gold that is coming to Solomon in one year is six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold,
\v 14 apart from what the tourists, and the merchants, are bringing in; and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land, are bringing in gold and silver to Solomon.
\v 15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of alloyed gold, six hundred shekels of alloyed gold he caused to go up on the one target;
\v 16 and three hundred shields of alloyed gold, three hundred shekels of gold he caused to go up on the one shield, and the king putteth them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\v 17 And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold;
\v 18 and six steps are to the throne, and a footstool of gold, to the throne they are fastened, and hands are on this side and on that on the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near the hands,
\v 19 and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps on this side, and on that: it had not been made so for any kingdom.
\v 20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon are of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon are of refined gold — silver is not reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything;
\v 21 for ships of the king are going to Tarshish, with servants of Huram: once in three years come do the ships of Tarshish bearing gold, and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
\v 22 And king Solomon became greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom;
\v 23 and all the kings of the earth are seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart,
\v 24 and they are bringing in each his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\v 25 And there are to Solomon four yousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve yousand horsemen, and he placed them in cities of the chariot, and with the king in Jerusalem.
\v 26 And he is ruling over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt.
\v 27 And the king made the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he had made as sycamores, that are in the low country, for abundance,
\v 28 and they are bringing out horses from Egypt to Solomon, and from all the lands.
\v 29 And the rest of the matters of Solomon, the first and the last, are they not written beside the matters of Nathan the prophet, and beside the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and with the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
\v 30 And Solomon reigneth in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years,
\v 31 and Solomon lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David his father, and reign did Rehoboam his son in his stead.
\c 10
\v 1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for to Shechem have all Israel come to cause him to reign.
\v 2 And it came to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat's — who is in Egypt because he had fled from the face of Solomon the king — hearing, that Jeroboam turneth back out of Egypt;
\v 3 and they send and call for him, and Jeroboam came in, and all Israel, and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,
\v 4 Your father made our yoke sharp, and now, make light somewhat of the sharp service of your father, and of his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.'
\v 5 And he said unto them, 'Yet three days — then return ye unto me;' and the people go.
\v 6 And king Rehoboam consulteth with the aged men who have been standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, 'How are ye counselling to answer this people?'
\v 7 And they speak unto him, saying, 'If you will become good to this people, and hast been pleased with them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.'
\v 8 And he forsaketh the counsel of the aged men that they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, those standing before him,
\v 9 and he said unto them, 'What are ye counselling, and we answer this people that have spoken unto me, saying, Make light somewhat of the yoke that your father put upon us?'
\v 10 And the lads who have grown up with him, speak with him, saying, 'Thus will you say to the people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and you, make light somewhat of our yoke; thus will you say unto them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father;
\v 11 and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I — I add unto your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I — with scorpions.'
\v 12 And Jeroboam came in, and all the people, unto Rehoboam on the third day, as the king spake, saying, 'Return unto me on the third day.'
\v 13 And the king answereth them sharply, and king Rehoboam forsaketh the counsel of the aged men,
\v 14 and spoke unto them according to the counsel of the lads, saying, 'My father made your yoke heavy, and I — I add unto it; my father chastised you with whips, and I — with scorpions.'
\v 15 And the king had not hearkened unto the people, for the revolution had been from God, for the sake of Yahweh's establishing His word that He spake by the hand of Abijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat.
\v 16 And all Israel have seen that the king had not hearkened to them, and the people send back to the king, saying, 'What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in a son of Jesse; each to your tents, O Israel; now, see your house — David,' and all Israel go to their tents.
\v 17 As to the sons of Israel who are dwelling in the cities of Judah — Rehoboam reigneth over them.
\v 18 And king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who is over the tribute, and the sons of Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam had strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;
\v 19 and Israel transgress against the house of David unto this day.
\c 11
\v 1 And Rehoboam came in to Jerusalem, and assembleth the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty yousand chosen warriors, to fight with Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam.
\v 2 And a word of Yahweh is unto Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
\v 3 'Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\v 4 Thus said Yahweh, Ye do not go up nor fight with your brethren, turn back each to his house, for from Me had this thing been;' and they hear the words of Yahweh, and turn back from going against Jeroboam.
\v 5 And Rehoboam dwelleth in Jerusalem, and built cities for a bulwark in Judah,
\v 6 yea, he built Beth-Lehem and Etam, and Tekoa,
\v 7 and Beth-Zur, and Shocho, and Adullam,
\v 8 and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
\v 9 and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
\v 10 and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, that are in Judah and in Benjamin, cities of bulwarks.
\v 11 And he strengtheneth the bulwarks, and putteth in them leaders, and treasures of food, and oil, and wine,
\v 12 and in every city and city targets and spears, and strengtheneth them very greatly; and he had Judah and Benjamin.
\v 13 And the priests, and the Levites, that are in all Israel, have stationed themselves by him, out of all their border,
\v 14 for the Levites have left their suburbs and their possession, and they come to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons have cast them off from acting as priests to Yahweh,
\v 15 and he establisheth to him priests for high places, and for goats, and for calves, that he made — 
\v 16 and after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those giving their heart to seek Yahweh, God of Israel, have come in to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, God of their father.
\v 17 And they strengthen the kingdom of Judah, and strengthen Rehoboam son of Solomon, for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
\v 18 And Rehoboam taketh to him a wife, Mahalath, child of Jerimoth son of David, and Abigail daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.
\v 19 And she beareth to him sons, Jeush, and Shamaria, and Zaham.
\v 20 And after her he had taken Maachah daughter of Absalom, and she beareth to him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\v 21 And Rehoboam loveth Maachah daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines — for eighteen wives he had taken, and sixty concubines — and he begetteth twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.
\v 22 And Rehoboam appointeth for head Abijah son of Maachah, for leader among his brethren, for to cause him to reign.
\v 23 And he had understanding, and spreadeth out of all his sons to all lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all cities of the bulwarks, and gave to them provision in abundance; and he asketh a multitude of wives.
\c 12
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the establishing of the kingdom of Rehoboam, and at his strengthening himself, he had forsaken the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him.
\v 2 And it came to pass, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, come up had Shishak king of Egypt against Jerusalem — because they trespassed against Yahweh — 
\v 3 with a yousand and two hundred chariots, and with sixty yousand horsemen, and there is no number to the people who have come with him out of Egypt — Lubim, Sukkiim, and Cushim — 
\v 4 and he captureth the cities of the bulwarks that are to Judah, and came in unto Jerusalem.
\v 5 And Shemaiah the prophet had come in unto Rehoboam and the heads of Judah who have been gathered unto Jerusalem from the presence of Shishak, and said to them, 'Thus said Yahweh, Ye have forsaken Me, and also, I have left you in the hand of Shishak;'
\v 6 and the heads of Israel are humbled, and the king, and they say, 'Righteous is Yahweh.'
\v 7 And when Yahweh saw that they have been humbled, a word of Yahweh had been unto Shemaiah, saying, 'They have been humbled; I do not destroy them, and I have given to them as a little thing for an escape, and I pour not out My fury in Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak;
\v 8 but they become servants to him, and they know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.'
\v 9 And Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and taketh the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the house of the king — the whole he had taken — and he taketh the shields of gold that Solomon had made;
\v 10 and king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and had given them a charge on the hand of the heads of the runners who are keeping the opening of the house of the king;
\v 11 and it came to pass, from the time of the going in of the king to the house of Yahweh, the runners have come in and lifted them up, and brought them back unto the chamber of the runners.
\v 12 And in his being humbled, turned back from him had the wrath of Yahweh, so as not to destroy to completion; and also, in Judah there have been good things.
\v 13 And king Rehoboam strengtheneth himself in Jerusalem, and reigneth; for a son of forty and two years is Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he had reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Yahweh had chosen to put His name there, out of all the tribes of Israel, and the name of his mother is Naamah the Ammonitess,
\v 14 and he did the evil thing, for he had not prepared his heart to seek Yahweh.
\v 15 And the matters of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written among the matters of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogy? And the wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam are all the days;
\v 16 and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David, and reign did Abijah his son in his stead.
\c 13
\v 1 In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam — Abijah reigneth over Judah;
\v 2 three years he had reigned in Jerusalem, (and the name of his mother is Michaiah daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah,) and war had been between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\v 3 And Abijah directeth the war with a force of mighty men of war, four hundred yousand chosen men, and Jeroboam had set in array with him battle, with eight hundred yousand chosen men, mighty of valour.
\v 4 And Abijah riseth up on the hill of Zemaraim that is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, 'Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
\v 5 Is it not for you to know that Yahweh, God of Israel, had given the kingdom to David over Israel to the age, to him and to his sons — a covenant of salt?
\v 6 and rise up did Jeroboam, son of Nebat, servant of Solomon son of David, and rebelleth against his lord!
\v 7 'And there are gathered unto him vain men, sons of worthlessness, and they strengthen themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon, and Rehoboam was a youth, and tender of heart, and had not strengthened himself against them.
\v 8 And now, ye are saying to strengthen yourselves before the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David, and ye are a numerous multitude, and with you calves of gold that Jeroboam had made to you for gods.
\v 9 'Have ye not cast out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to you priests like the peoples of the lands? every one who had come to fill his hand with a bullock, a son of the herd, and seven rams, even he had been a priest to No-gods!
\v 10 As for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken Him, and priests are ministering to Yahweh, sons of Aaron and the Levites, in the work,
\v 11 and are making perfume to Yahweh, burnt-offerings morning by morning, and evening by evening, and perfume of spices, and the arrangement of bread is on the pure table, and the candlestick of gold, and its lamps, to burn evening by evening, for we are keeping the charge of Yahweh our God, and ye — ye have forsaken Him.
\v 12 And lo, with us — at our head — is God, and His priests and trumpets of shouting to shout against you; O sons of Israel, do not fight with Yahweh, God of your fathers, for ye do not prosper.'
\v 13 And Jeroboam had brought round the ambush to come in from behind them, and they are before Judah, and the ambush is behind them.
\v 14 And Judah turneth, and lo, against them is the battle, before and behind, and they cry to Yahweh, and the priests are blowing with trumpets,
\v 15 and the men of Judah shout — and it came to pass, at the shouting of the men of Judah, that God had smitten Jeroboam, and all Israel, before Abijah and Judah.
\v 16 And the sons of Israel flee from the face of Judah, and God gave them into their hand,
\v 17 and Abijah and his people smite among them a great smiting, and there fall wounded of Israel five hundred yousand chosen men.
\v 18 And the sons of Israel are humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah are strong, for they have leant on Yahweh, God of their fathers.
\v 19 And Abijah pursueth after Jeroboam, and captureth from him cities, Beth-El and its small towns, and Jeshanah and its small towns, and Ephraim and its small towns.
\v 20 And Jeroboam had not retained power any more in the days of Abijah, and Yahweh smiteth him, and he dieth.
\v 21 And Abijah strengtheneth himself, and taketh to him fourteen wives, and begetteth twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters,
\v 22 and the rest of the matters of Abijah, and his ways, and his words, are written in the 'Inquiry' of the prophet Iddo.
\c 14
\v 1 And Abijah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign did Asa his son in his stead: in his days was the land quiet ten years.
\v 2 And Asa did that which is good, and that which is right, in the eyes of Yahweh his God,
\v 3 and turneth aside the altars of the stranger, and the high places, and breaketh the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the shrines,
\v 4 and said to Judah to seek Yahweh, God of their fathers, and to do the law and the command;
\v 5 and he turneth aside out of all cities of Judah the high places and the images, and the kingdom is quiet before him.
\v 6 And he built cities of bulwarks in Judah, for the land had quiet, and there is no war with him in these years, because Yahweh had given rest to him.
\v 7 And he said to Judah, 'Let us build these cities, and compass them with wall, and towers, two-leaved doors, and bars, while the land is before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God, we have sought, and He gave rest to us round about;' and they build and prosper.
\v 8 And there is to Asa a force bearing target and spear, out of Judah three hundred yousand, and out of Benjamin, bearing shield and treading bow, two hundred and eighty yousand: all these are mighty of valour.
\v 9 And come out unto them did Zerah the Cushite with a force of a yousand yousand, and chariots three hundred, and he came in unto Mareshah,
\v 10 and Asa went out before him, and they set battle in array in the valley of Zephadah at Mareshah.
\v 11 And Asa called unto Yahweh his God, and said, 'Yahweh! it is nothing with Thee to help, between the mighty and those who have no power; help us, O Yahweh, our God, for on Thee we have leant, and in Your name we have come against this multitude; O Yahweh, our God you art; let him not prevail with Thee — mortal man!
\v 12 And Yahweh smiteth the Cushim before Asa, and before Judah, and the Cushim flee,
\v 13 and Asa and the people who are with him pursue them even to Gerar, and there fall of the Cushim, for they have no preserving, because they have been broken before Yahweh, and before His camp; and they bear away very much spoil,
\v 14 and smite all the cities round about Gerar, for a fear of Yahweh had been upon them, and they spoil all the cities, for abundant spoil had been in them;
\v 15 and also tents of cattle they have smitten, and they capture sheep in abundance, and camels, and turn back to Jerusalem.
\c 15
\v 1 And upon Azariah son of Oded had been the Spirit of God,
\v 2 and he went out before Asa, and said to him, 'Hear, me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; Yahweh is with you — in your being with Him, and if ye seek Him, He is found of you, and if ye forsake Him, He forsaketh you;
\v 3 and many days are to Israel wiyout a true God, and wiyout a teaching priest, and wiyout law,
\v 4 and it turneth back in its distress unto Yahweh, God of Israel, and they seek Him, and He is found of them,
\v 5 and in those times there is no peace to him who is going out, and to him who is coming in, for many troubles are on all the inhabitants of the lands,
\v 6 and they have been beaten down, nation by nation, and city by city, for God had troubled them with every adversity;
\v 7 and ye, be ye strong, and let not your hands be feeble, for there is a reward for your work.'
\v 8 And at Asa's hearing these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he had strengthened himself, and did cause the abominations to pass away out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that he had captured from the hill-country of Ephraim, and reneweth the altar of Yahweh that is before the porch of Yahweh,
\v 9 and gathereth all Judah and Benjamin, and the sojourners with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and out of Simeon — for they have fallen unto him from Israel in abundance, in their seeing that Yahweh his God is with him.
\v 10 And they are gathered to Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,
\v 11 and sacrifice to Yahweh on that day from the spoil they have brought in — oxen seven hundred, and sheep seven yousand,
\v 12 and they enter into a covenant to seek Yahweh, God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul,
\v 13 and every one who did not seek for Yahweh, God of Israel, is put to death, from small unto great, from man unto woman.
\v 14 And they swear to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets,
\v 15 and rejoice do all Judah concerning the oath, for with all their heart they have sworn, and with all their good-will they have sought Him, and He is found of them, and Yahweh gave rest to them round about.
\v 16 And also Maachah, mother of Asa the king — he had removed her from being mistress, in that she had made for a shrine a horrible thing, and Asa cutteth down her horrible thing, and beateth it small, and burneth it by the brook Kidron:
\v 17 yet the high places have not turned aside from Israel; only, the heart of Asa had been perfect all his days.
\v 18 And he brought in the sanctified things of his father, and his own sanctified things, to the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\v 19 And war had not been till the thirty and fifth year of the reign of Asa.
\c 16
\v 1 In the thirty and sixth year of the reign of Asa, come up had Baasha king of Israel, against Judah, and built Ramah, so as not to permit any going out and coming in to Asa king of Judah.
\v 2 And Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and of the house of the king, and sent unto Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who is dwelling in Damascus, saying,
\v 3 A covenant is between me and thee, and between my father and your father, lo, I have sent to thee silver and gold; go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he did go up from off me.'
\v 4 And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa, and sent the heads of the forces that he had unto cities of Israel, and they smite Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Maim, and all the stores, cities of Naphtali.
\v 5 And it came to pass, at Baasha's hearing, that he ceaseth from building Ramah, and letteth his work rest;
\v 6 and Asa the king had taken all Judah, and they bear away the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha had built, and he built with them Geba and Mizpah.
\v 7 And at that time had Hanani the seer come in unto Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, 'Because of your leaning on the king of Aram, and you hast not leaned on Yahweh your God, therefore had the force of the king of Aram escaped from your hand.
\v 8 Did not the Cushim and the Lubim become a very great force for multitude, for chariot, and for horsemen? and in your leaning on Yahweh He gave them into your hand,
\v 9 for Yahweh — His eyes go to and fro in all the earth, to show Himself strong for a people whose heart is perfect towards Him; you hast been foolish concerning this, because — henceforth there are with thee wars.'
\v 10 And Asa is angry at the seer, and gave him to the house of torture, for he is in a rage with him for this; and Asa oppresseth some of the people at that time.
\v 11 And lo, the matters of Asa, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\v 12 And Asa is diseased — in the thirty and ninth year of his reign — in his feet, till his disease is excessive, and also in his disease he had not sought Yahweh, but among physicians.
\v 13 And Asa lieth with his fathers, and dieth in the forty and first year of his reign,
\v 14 and they bury him in one of his graves, that he had prepared for himself in the city of David, and they cause him to lie on a bed that one had filled with spices, and divers kinds of mixtures, with perfumed work; and they burn for him a burning — very great.
\c 17
\v 1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead, and he strengtheneth himself against Israel,
\v 2 and putteth a force in all the fenced cities of Judah, and putteth garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.
\v 3 And Yahweh is with Jehoshaphat, for he had walked in the first ways of David his father, and had not sought to Baalim,
\v 4 for to the God of his father he had sought, and in His commands he had walked, and not according to the work of Israel.
\v 5 And Yahweh did establish the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah give a present to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honour in abundance,
\v 6 and his heart is high in the ways of Yahweh, and again he had turned aside the high places and the shrines out of Judah.
\v 7 And in the third year of his reign he had sent for his heads, for Ben-Hail, and for Obadiah, and for Zechariah, and for Nethaneel, and for Michaiah, to teach in cities of Judah,
\v 8 and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijath, and Tob-Adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
\v 9 And they teach in Judah, and with them is the Book of the Law of Yahweh, and they go round about into all cities of Judah, and teach among the people.
\v 10 And here is a fear of Yahweh on all kingdoms of the lands that are round about Judah, and they have not fought with Jehoshaphat;
\v 11 and of the Philistines they are bringing in to Jehoshaphat a present, and tribute silver; also, the Arabians are bringing to him a flock, rams seven yousand an seven hundred, and he-goats seven yousand and seven hundred.
\v 12 And Jehoshaphat is going on and becoming very great, and he built in Judah palaces and cities of store,
\v 13 and he had much work in cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty of valour, are in Jerusalem.
\v 14 And these are their numbers, for the house of their fathers: Of Judah, heads of yousands, Adnah the head, and with him mighty ones of valour, three hundred chiefs.
\v 15 And at his hand is Jehohanan the head, and with him two hundred and eighty chiefs.
\v 16 And at his hand is Amasiah son of Zichri, who is willingly offering himself to Yahweh, and with him two hundred chiefs, mighty of valour.
\v 17 And of Benjamin: mighty of valour, Eliada, and with him, armed with bow and shield, two hundred chiefs.
\v 18 And at his hand is Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty chiefs, armed ones of the host.
\v 19 These are those serving the king, apart from those whom the king put in the cities of fortress, in all Judah.
\c 18
\v 1 And Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joineth affinity to Ahab,
\v 2 and went down at the end of certain years unto Ahab to Samaria, and Ahab sacrificeth for him sheep and oxen in abundance, and for the people who are with him, and persuadeth him to go up unto Ramoth-Gilead.
\v 3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, 'Dost you go with me to Ramoth-Gilead?' And he said to him, 'As I — so you, and as your people — my people, even with thee in battle.'
\v 4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, 'Seek, I pray thee, this day, the word of Yahweh.'
\v 5 And the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, four hundred men, and said unto them, 'Do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' And they say, 'Go up, and God did give it into the hand of the king.'
\v 6 And Jehoshaphat said, 'Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh still, and we seek from him?'
\v 7 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, 'Still — one man to seek Yahweh from him, and I — I have hated him, for he is not prophesying concerning me of good, but all his days of evil, he is Micaiah son of Imlah;' and Jehoshaphat said, 'Let not the king say so.'
\v 8 And the king of Israel called unto a certain officer, and said, 'Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.'
\v 9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, and they are sitting in a threshing-floor at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets are prophesying before them.
\v 10 And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and said, 'Thus said Yahweh,
\v 11 With these you will push Aram till you hast consumed them.' And all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, 'Go up to Ramath-Gilead and prosper, and Yahweh had given it into the hand of the king.'
\v 12 And the messenger who had gone to call for Micaiah had spoken unto him, saying, 'Lo, the words of the prophets — one mouth — are good towards the king, and let, I pray thee, your word be like one of theirs: and you hast spoken good.'
\v 13 And Micaiah said 'Yahweh lived, surely that which my God said, it I speak.'
\v 14 And he came in unto the king, and the king said unto him, 'Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' And he said, 'Go ye up, and prosper, and they are given into your hand.'
\v 15 And the king said unto him, 'How many times am I adjuring thee, that you speak unto me only truth in the name of Yahweh?'
\v 16 And he said, 'I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd, and Yahweh said, There are no masters to these, they turn back each to his house in peace.'
\v 17 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, 'Did I not say unto thee, He did not prophesy concerning me good, but rather of evil?'
\v 18 And he said, 'Therefore, hear ye a word of Yahweh: I have seen Yahweh sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right and His left;
\v 19 and Yahweh said, Who did entice Ahab king of Israel, and he did go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? And this speaker said thus, and that speaker thus.
\v 20 And go out did the spirit, and stand before Yahweh, and said, I do entice him; and Yahweh said unto him, With what?
\v 21 and he said, I go out, and have become a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said, Thou will entice, and also, you art able; go out and do so.
\v 22 And, now, lo, Yahweh had put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of these your prophets, and Yahweh had spoken concerning thee — evil.'
\v 23 And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came nigh, and smiteth Micaiah on the cheek, and said, 'Where is this — the way the Spirit of Yahweh passed over from me to speak with thee?'
\v 24 And Micaiah said, 'Lo, you will see in that day, that you will enter into the innermost chamber to be hidden.'
\v 25 And the king of Israel said, 'Take ye Micaiah, and turn him back unto Amon head of the city, and unto Joash son of the king,
\v 26 and ye have said, Thus said the king, Put ye this one in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat bread of oppression, and water of oppression, till my return in peace.'
\v 27 And Micaiah said, 'If you will certainly return in peace, Yahweh had not spoken by me;' and he said, 'Hear ye, O peoples, all of them!'
\v 28 And the king of Israel went up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, unto Ramoth-Gilead;
\v 29 and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat to disguise himself, and to go into battle, 'And you, put on your garments.' And the king of Israel disguiseth himself, and they go into battle.
\v 30 And the king of Aram had commanded the heads of the charioteers whom he had, saying, 'Ye do not fight with small or with great, except with the king of Israel by himself.'
\v 31 And it came to pass at the heads of the charioteers seeing Jehoshaphat, that they have said, 'The king of Israel he is,' and they turn round against him to fight, and Jehoshaphat crieth out, and Yahweh had helped him, and God enticeth them from him,
\v 32 yea, it came to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing that it had not been the king of Israel — they turn back from after him.
\v 33 And a man had drawn with a bow, in his simplicity, and smiteth the king of Israel between the joinings and the coat of mail, and he said to the charioteer, 'Turn your hand, and you hast brought me out of the camp, for I have become sick.'
\v 34 And the battle increaseth on that day, and the king of Israel had been stayed up in the chariot over-against Aram till the evening, and he dieth at the time of the going in of the sun.
\c 19
\v 1 And Jehoshaphat king of Judah turneth back unto his house in peace to Jerusalem,
\v 2 and go out unto his presence did Jehu son of Hanani, the seer, and said unto king Jehoshaphat, 'To give help to the wicked, and to those hating Yahweh, will you love? and for this against thee is wrath from before Yahweh,
\v 3 but good things have been found with thee, for you hast put away the shrines out of the land, and hast prepared your heart to seek God.'
\v 4 And Jehoshaphat dwelleth in Jerusalem, and he turneth back and went out among the people from Beer-Sheba unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Yahweh, God of their fathers.
\v 5 And he establisheth judges in the land, in all the fenced cities of Judah, for every city,
\v 6 and said unto the judges, 'See what ye are doing — for not for man do ye judge, but for Yahweh, who is with you in the matter of judgment;
\v 7 and now, let fear of Yahweh be upon you, observe and do, for there is not with Yahweh our God perverseness, and acceptance of faces, and taking of a bribe.'
\v 8 And also in Jerusalem had Jehoshaphat appointed of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for strife; and they turn back to Jerusalem,
\v 9 and he laid a charge upon them, saying, 'Thus do ye do in the fear of Yahweh, in faithfulness, and with a perfect heart,
\v 10 and any strife that came in unto you of your brethren who are dwelling in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and command, statutes, and judgments, then ye have warned them and they become not guilty before Yahweh, and wrath had not been on you and on your brethren; thus do ye do, and ye are not guilty.
\v 11 And, lo, Amariah the head priest is over you for every matter of Yahweh, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the house of Judah, is for every matter of the king, and officers the Levites are before you; be strong and do, and Yahweh is with the good.'
\c 20
\v 1 And it came to pass after this, the sons of Moab have come in, and the sons of Ammon, and with them of the peoples, against Jehoshaphat to battle.
\v 2 And they come in and declare to Jehoshaphat, saying, 'Come against thee had a great multitude from beyond the sea, from Aram, and lo, they are in Hazezon-Tamar — it is En-Gedi.'
\v 3 And Jehoshaphat feareth, and setteth his face to seek to Yahweh, and proclaimeth a fast over all Judah;
\v 4 and Judah is gathered to inquire of Yahweh; also, from all the cities of Judah they have come in to seek Yahweh.
\v 5 And Jehoshaphat standeth in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Yahweh, at the front of the new court,
\v 6 and said, 'O Yahweh, God of our fathers, art not Thou — God in the heavens? yea, Thou art ruling over all kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is power and might, and there is none with Thee to station himself.
\v 7 'Art not Thou our God? Thou hast dispossessed the inhabitants of this land from before Your people Israel, and will give it to the seed of Abraham Your friend to the age,
\v 8 and they dwell in it, and build to Thee in it a sanctuary for Your name, saying,
\v 9 If evil did come upon us — sword, judgment, and pestilence, and famine — we stand before this house, and before Thee, for Your name is in this house, and cry unto Thee out of our distress, and Thou will hear and save.
\v 10 'And now, lo, sons of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom Thou did not grant to Israel to go in against in their coming out of the land of Egypt, for they turned aside from off them and destroyed them not,
\v 11 and lo, they are recompensing to us — to come in to drive us out of Your possession, that Thou hast caused us to possess.
\v 12 O our God, will Thou not execute judgment upon them? for there is no power in us before this great multitude that had come against us, and we know not what we do, but on Thee are our eyes.'
\v 13 And all Judah are standing before Yahweh, also their infants, their wives, and their sons.
\v 14 And upon Jahaziel, son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, had the Spirit of Yahweh been, in the middle of the assembly,
\v 15 and he said, 'Attend, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and O king Jehoshaphat, Thus said Yahweh to you, Ye fear not, nor are afraid of the face of this great multitude, for not for you is the battle, but for God.
\v 16 To-morrow, go ye down against them, lo, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and ye have found them in the end of the valley, the front of the wilderness of Jeruel.
\v 17 Not for you to fight in this; station yourselves, stand, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem — be not afraid nor fear ye — to-morrow go out before them, and Yahweh is with you.'
\v 18 And Jehoshaphat boweth — face to the earth — and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have fallen before Yahweh, to bow themselves to Yahweh.
\v 19 And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohadites, and of the sons of the Korhites, rise to give praise to Yahweh, God of Israel, with a loud voice on high.
\v 20 And they rise early in the morning, and go out to the wilderness of Tekoa, and in their going out Jehoshaphat had stood and said, 'Hear me, O Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, remain stedfast in Yahweh your God, and be stedfast; remain stedfast in His prophets, and prosper.'
\v 21 And he taketh counsel with the people, and appointeth singers to Yahweh, and those giving praise to the honour of holiness, in the going out before the armed men, and saying, 'Give ye thanks to Yahweh, for to the age is His kindness.'
\v 22 And at the time they have begun with singing and praise, Yahweh had put ambushments against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who are coming in to Judah, and they are smitten,
\v 23 and the sons of Ammon stand up, and Moab, against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to devote and to destroy, and at their finishing with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped, a man against his neighbour, to destroy.
\v 24 And Judah had come in unto the watch-tower, to the wilderness, and they look unto the multitude, and lo, they are carcases fallen to the earth, and there is none escaped,
\v 25 and Jehoshaphat came in, and his people, to seize their spoil, and they find among them, in abundance, both goods and carcases, and desirable vessels, and they take spoil to themselves wiyout prohibition, and they are three days seizing the spoil, for it is abundant.
\v 26 And on the fourth day they have been assembled at the valley of Blessing, for there they blessed Yahweh: therefore they have called the name of that place, 'Valley of Blessing,' unto this day.
\v 27 And they turn back, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to go back unto Jerusalem with joy, for Yahweh had made them rejoice over their enemies.
\v 28 And they come in to Jerusalem with psalteries, and with harps, and with trumpets, unto the house of Yahweh.
\v 29 And there is a fear of God on all kingdoms of the lands in their hearing that Yahweh had fought with the enemies of Israel,
\v 30 and the kingdom of Jehoshaphat is quiet, and his God gave rest to him round about.
\v 31 And Jehoshaphat reigneth over Judah, a son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
\v 32 And he walketh in the way of his father Asa, and had not turned aside from it, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 33 Only, the high places have not turned aside, and still the people have not prepared their heart for the God of their fathers.
\v 34 And the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, lo, they are written among the matters of Jehu son of Hanani, who had been mentioned on the book of the kings of Israel.
\v 35 And after this had Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, (he did wickedly in so doing),
\v 36 and he joineth him with himself to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they make ships in Ezion-Geber,
\v 37 and prophesy did Eliezer son of Dodavah, of Mareshah, against Jehoshaphat, saying, 'For your joining yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh had broken up your works;' and the ships are broken, and have not retained power to go unto Tarshish.
\c 21
\v 1 And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 2 And he had brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these are sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel,
\v 3 and their father gave to them many gifts of silver and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, and the kingdom he had given to Jehoram, for He is the first-born.
\v 4 And Jehoram riseth up over the kingdom of his father, and strengtheneth himself, and slaid all his brethren with the sword, and also — of the heads of Israel.
\v 5 A son of thirty and two years is Jehoram in his reigning, and eight years he had reigned in Jerusalem,
\v 6 and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab had been to him for a wife, and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh,
\v 7 and Yahweh had not been willing to destroy the house of David, for the sake of the covenant that He made with David, and as He had said to give to him a lamp, and to his sons — all the days.
\v 8 In his days had Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and cause a king to reign over them;
\v 9 and Jehoram passeth over with his heads, and all the chariots with him, and it came to pass, he had risen by night and smiteth the Edomites who are coming round against him, and the princes of the chariots,
\v 10 and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah unto this day; then did Libnah revolt at that time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, God of his fathers,
\v 11 also, he had made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom, and compelleth Judah.
\v 12 And there came in unto him a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of David your father, Because that you hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
\v 13 and you will walk in the way of the kings of Israel, and will cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom like the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also your brethren, the house of your father, who are better than yourself, you hast killed;
\v 14 lo, Yahweh is smiting — a great smiting — among your people, and among your sons, and among your wives, and among all your goods — 
\v 15 and you, with many sicknesses, with disease of your bowels, till your bowels come out, by the sickness, day by day.'
\v 16 And Yahweh waketh up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who are beside the Cushim,
\v 17 and they come up into Judah, and rend it, and take captive all the substance that is found at the house of the king, and also his sons, and his wives, and there had not been left to him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.
\v 18 And after all this had Yahweh plagued him in his bowels by a disease for which there is no healing,
\v 19 and it came to pass, from days to days, and at the time of the going out of the end of two years, his bowels have gone out with his sickness, and he dieth of sore diseases, and his people have not made for him a burning like the burning of his fathers.
\v 20 A son of thirty and two years was he in his reigning, and eight years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and he went wiyout desire, and they bury him in the city of David, and not in the graves of the kings.
\c 22
\v 1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem cause Ahaziah his youngest son to reign in his stead, (for all the elder had the troop killed that came in with the Arabians to the camp,) and Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah reigneth.
\v 2 A son of twenty and two years is Ahaziah in his reigning, and one year he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Athaliah daughter of Omri;
\v 3 he also had walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother had been his counsellor to do wickedly.
\v 4 And he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, like the house of Ahab, for they have been his counsellors, after the death of his father, for destruction to him.
\v 5 Also, in their counsel he had walked, and went with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel to battle against Hazael king of Aram, in Ramoth-Gilead, and they of Ramah smite Joram;
\v 6 and he turneth back to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds with which they had smitten him in Ramah, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah son of Jehoram king of Judah had gone down to see Jehoram son of Ahab, in Jezreel, for he is sick;
\v 7 and from God had been the destruction of Ahaziah, to come unto Joram: and in his coming he had gone out with Jehoram unto Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\v 8 And it came to pass, in Jehu's executing judgment with the house of Ahab, that he findeth the heads of Judah and sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministers of Ahaziah, and slaid them.
\v 9 And he seeketh Ahaziah, and they capture him, (and he is hiding himself in Samaria), and bring him in unto Jehu, and put him to death, and bury him, for they said, 'He is son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart;' and there is none to the house of Ahaziah to retain power for the kingdom.
\v 10 And Athaliah mother of Ahaziah had seen that her son is dead, and she riseth and destroyeth the whole seed of the kingdom of the house of Judah.
\v 11 And Jehoshabeath daughter of the king taketh Joash son of Ahaziah, and stealeth him from the middle of the sons of the king who are put to death, and putteth him and his nurse into the inner part of the bed-chambers, and Jehoshabeath daughter of king Jehoram, wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she had been sister of Ahaziah, hideth him from the face of Athaliah, and she had not put him to death.
\v 12 And he is with them in the house of God hiding himself six years, and Athaliah is reigning over the land.
\c 23
\v 1 And in the seventh year had Jehoiada strengthened himself, and taketh the heads of the hundreds, even Azariah son of Jeroham, and Ishmael son of Jehohanan, and Azariah son of Obed, and Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri, with him into covenant.
\v 2 And they go round about in Judah, and gather the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and heads of the fathers of Israel, and come in unto Jerusalem,
\v 3 and all the assembly make a covenant in the house of God with the king, and he said to them, 'Lo, the son of the king did reign, as Yahweh spake concerning the sons of David.
\v 4 This is the thing that ye do: The third of you, going in on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, are for gatekeepers of the thresholds,
\v 5 and the third are at the house of the king, and the third at the gate of the foundation, and all the people are in the courts of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 And none did enter the house of Yahweh except the priests, and those ministering of the Levites (they go in for they are holy), and all the people keep the watch of Yahweh:
\v 7 and the Levites have compassed the king round about, each with his weapon in his hand, and he who had gone in unto the house is put to death; and be ye with the king in his coming in and in his going out.'
\v 8 And the Levites and all Judah do according to all that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and take each his men going in on the sabbath, with those going out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest had not let away the courses.
\v 9 And Jehoiada the priest gave to the heads of the hundreds the spears, and the shields, and the bucklers that are king David's, that are in the house of God;
\v 10 and he stationeth the whole of the people, and each his dart in his hand, from the right shoulder of the house unto the left shoulder of the house, at the altar, and at the house, by the king, round about.
\v 11 And they bring out the son of the king, and put upon him the crown, and the testimony, and cause him to reign; and Jehoiada and his sons anoint him, and say, 'Let the king live!'
\v 12 And Athaliah heareth the voice of the people who are running, and who are praising the king, and she came in unto the people in the house of Yahweh,
\v 13 and saw, and lo, the king is standing by his pillar in the entrance, and the heads, and the trumpets are by the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and shouting with trumpets, and the singers with instruments of song, and the teachers, to praise, and Athaliah rendeth her garments, and said, 'Conspiracy, conspiracy.'
\v 14 And Jehoiada the priest brought out the heads of the hundreds, inspectors of the force, and said unto them, 'Take her out from within the rows, and he who had gone after her is put to death by the sword;' for the priest said, 'Put her not to death in the house of Yahweh.'
\v 15 And they make for her sides, and she came in unto the entrance of the gate of the horses at the house of the king, and they put her to death there.
\v 16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, to be for a people to Yahweh;
\v 17 and all the people enter the house of Baal, and break it down, yea, his altars and his images they have broken, and Mattan priest of Baal they have killed before the altars.
\v 18 And Jehoiada putteth the offices of the house of Yahweh into the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had apportioned over the house of Yahweh, to cause to ascend the burnt-offerings of Yahweh, as written in the law of Moses, with joy, and with singing, by the hands of David;
\v 19 and he stationeth the gatekeepers over the gates of the house of Yahweh, and the unclean in anything did not go in.
\v 20 And he taketh the heads of the hundreds, and the honourable ones, and the rulers among the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Yahweh, and they come in through the high gate to the house of the king, and cause the king to sit on the throne of the kingdom.
\v 21 And all the people of the land rejoice, and the city had been quiet, and Athaliah they have put to death by the sword.
\c 24
\v 1 A son of seven years is Joash in his reigning, and forty years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Zibiah of Beer-Sheba.
\v 2 And Joash did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\v 3 And Jehoiada taketh for him two wives, and he begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 4 And it came to pass after this, it had been with the heart of Joash to renew the house of Yahweh,
\v 5 and he gathereth the priests and the Levites, and said to them, 'Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to strengthen the house of your God sufficiently year by year, and ye, ye do haste to the matter;' and the Levites have not hasted.
\v 6 And the king called for Jehoiada the head, and said to him, 'Wherefore hast you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses, servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
\v 7 for sons of Athaliah, the wicked one, have broken up the house of God, and also, all the holy things of the house of Yahweh they have prepared for Baalim.'
\v 8 And the king spoke, and they make one chest, and put it at the gate of the house of Yahweh wiyout,
\v 9 and give an intimation in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring in to Yahweh the tribute of Moses, servant of God, laid on Israel in the wilderness.
\v 10 And all the heads, and all the people rejoice, and they bring in, and cast into the chest, unto completion.
\v 11 And it came to pass, at the time one brought in the chest for the inspection of the king by the hand of the Levites, and at their seeing that the money is abundant, that a scribe of the king had come in, and an officer of the head-priest, and they empty the chest, and take it up and turn it back unto its place; thus they have done day by day, and gather money in abundance.
\v 12 And the king and Jehoiada give it unto the doers of the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and they are hiring hewers and artificers to renew the house of Yahweh, and also — to artificers in iron and brass to strengthen the house of Yahweh.
\v 13 And those doing the business work, and there went up lengthening to the work by their hand, and they establish the house of God, by its proper measure, and strengthen it.
\v 14 And at their completing it, they have brought in before the king and Jehoiada the rest of the money, and they make it vessels for the house of Yahweh, vessels of serving, and of offering up, and spoons, even vessels of gold and silver; and they are causing burnt-offerings to ascend in the house of Yahweh continually, all the days of Jehoiada.
\v 15 And Jehoiada is aged and satisfied with days, and dieth — a son of a hundred and thirty years in his death,
\v 16 and they bury him in the city of David, with the kings, for he had done good in Israel, and with God, and his house.
\v 17 And after the death of Jehoiada come in have heads of Judah, and bow themselves to the king; then had the king hearkened unto them,
\v 18 and they forsake the house of Yahweh, God of their fathers, and serve the shrines and the idols, and there is wrath upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt.
\v 19 And He sent among them prophets, to bring them back unto Yahweh, and they testify against them, and they have not given ear;
\v 20 and the Spirit of God had clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and he standeth over-against the people, and said to them, 'Thus said God, Why are ye transgressing the commands of Yahweh, and prosper not? because ye have forsaken Yahweh — He did forsake you.'
\v 21 And they conspire against him, and stone him with stones by the command of the king, in the court of the house of Yahweh,
\v 22 and Joash the king had not remembered the kindness that Jehoiada his father did with him, and slaid his son, and in his death he said, 'Yahweh did see, and require.'
\v 23 And it came to pass, at the turn of the year, come up had the force of Aram against him, and they come in unto Judah and Jerusalem, and destroy all the heads of the people from the people, and all their spoil they have sent to the king of Damascus,
\v 24 for with few men have the force of Aram come in, and Yahweh had given into their hand a mighty force for multitude, because they have forsaken Yahweh, God of their fathers; and with Joash they have executed judgments.
\v 25 And in their going from him — for they left him with many diseases — his servants themselves have conspired against him, for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slay him on his bed, and he dieth; and they bury him in the city of David, and have not buried him in the graves of the kings.
\v 26 And these are those conspiring against him, Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
\v 27 As to his sons, and the greatness of the burden upon him, and the foundation of the house of God, lo, they are written on the 'Inquiry' of the book of the Kings; and reign did Amaziah his son in his stead.
\c 25
\v 1 A son of twenty and five years had Amaziah reigned, and twenty and nine years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jehoaddan of Jerusalem,
\v 2 and he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh — only, not with a perfect heart.
\v 3 And it came to pass, when the kingdom had been strong upon him, that he slaid his servants, those smiting the king his father,
\v 4 and their sons he had not put to death, but did as is written in the law, in the book of Moses, whom Yahweh commanded, saying, 'Fathers do not die for sons, and sons die not for fathers, but each for his own sin they die.'
\v 5 And Amaziah gathereth Judah, and appointeth them, according to the house of the fathers, for heads of the yousands, and for heads of the hundreds, for all Judah and Benjamin; and he inspecteth them from a son of twenty years and upward, and findeth them three hundred yousand chosen ones, going forth to the host, holding spear and target.
\v 6 And he hireth out of Israel a hundred yousand mighty ones of valour, with a hundred talents of silver;
\v 7 and a man of God had come in unto him, saying, 'O king, the host of Israel did not go with thee; for Yahweh is not with Israel — all the sons of Ephraim;
\v 8 but if you art going — do it, be strong for battle, God did cause thee to stumble before an enemy, for there is power in God to help, and to cause to stumble.'
\v 9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, 'And what — to do for the hundred talents that I have given to the troop of Israel?' And the man of God said, 'Yahweh had more to give to thee than this.'
\v 10 And Amaziah separated them — for the troop that had come in unto him from Ephraim to go to their own place, and their anger did burn mightily against Judah, and they turn back to their place in the heat of anger.
\v 11 And Amaziah had strengthened himself, and leadeth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smiteth the sons of Seir — ten yousand.
\v 12 And ten yousand alive have the sons of Judah taken captive, and they bring them to the top of the rock, and cast them from the top of the rock, and all of them have been broken.
\v 13 And the sons of the troop that Amaziah had sent back from going with him to battle — they rush against cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-Horon, and smite of them three yousand, and seize much prey.
\v 14 And it came to pass, after the coming in of Amaziah from smiting the Edomites, that he brought in the gods of the sons of Seir, and establisheth them to him for gods, and before them did bow himself, and to them he made perfume.
\v 15 And the anger of Yahweh burneth against Amaziah, and He sent unto him a prophet, and he said unto him, 'Why hast you sought the gods of the people that have not delivered their people out of your hand?'
\v 16 And it came to pass, in his speaking unto him, that he said to him, 'For a counsellor to the king have we appointed thee? cease for thee; why do they smite thee?' And the prophet ceaseth, and said, 'I have known that God had counselled to destroy thee, because you hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.'
\v 17 And Amaziah king of Judah taketh counsel, and sent unto Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
\v 18 Come, we look one another in the face.' And Joash king of Israel sent unto Amaziah king of Judah, saying, 'The thorn that is in Lebanon had sent unto the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son for a wife; and pass by did a beast of the field that is in Lebanon, and treadeth down the thorn.
\v 19 Thou hast said, Lo, I have smitten Edom; and your heart had lifted thee up to boast; now, abide in your house, why will you stir yourself up in evil, that you hast fallen, you, and Judah with thee?'
\v 20 And Amaziah had not hearkened, for from God it is in order to give them into hand, because they have sought the gods of Edom;
\v 21 and go up did Joash king of Israel, and they look one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in Beth-Shemesh, that is Judah's,
\v 22 and Judah is smitten before Israel, and they flee — each to his tents.
\v 23 And Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, had Joash king of Israel caught in Beth-Shemesh, and brought him in to Jerusalem, and breaketh down in the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits,
\v 24 and taketh all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that are found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the house of the king, and the sons of the pledges, and turneth back to Samaria.
\v 25 And Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years;
\v 26 and the rest of the matters of Amaziah, the first and the last, lo, are they not written on the books of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\v 27 And from the time that Amaziah had turned aside from after Yahweh — they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fleeth to Lachish, and they send after him to Lachish, and put him to death there,
\v 28 and lift him up on the horses, and bury him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
\c 26
\v 1 And all the people of Judah take Uzziah (and he is a son of sixteen years), and cause him to reign instead of his father Amaziah.
\v 2 He had built Eloth, and restoreth it to Judah after the king's lying with his fathers.
\v 3 A son of sixteen years is Uzziah in his reigning, and fifty and two years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
\v 4 And he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father did,
\v 5 and he is as one seeking God in the days of Zechariah who had understanding in visions of God: and in the days of his seeking Yahweh, God had caused him to prosper.
\v 6 And he went forth, and fighteth with the Philistines, and breaketh down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\v 7 And God helpeth him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who are dwelling in Gur-Baal and the Mehunim.
\v 8 And the Ammonites give a present to Uzziah, and his name went unto the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened himself greatly.
\v 9 And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, by the gate of the corner, and by the gate of the valley, and by the angle, and strengtheneth them;
\v 10 and he built towers in the wilderness, and diggeth many wells, for he had much cattle, both in the low country and in the plain, husbandmen and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel; for he was a lover of the ground.
\v 11 And Uzziah had a force, making war, going forth to the host, by troops, in the number of their reckoning by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Masseiah the officer, by the hand of Hananiah one of the heads of the king.
\v 12 The whole number of heads of the fathers of the mighty ones of valour is two yousand and six hundred;
\v 13 and by their hand is the force of the host, three hundred yousand, and seven yousand, and five hundred warriors, with mighty power to give help to the king against the enemy.
\v 14 And Uzziah prepared for them, for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, even to stones of the slings.
\v 15 And he made in Jerusalem inventions — a device of an inventor — to be on the towers, and on the corners, to shoot with arrows and with great stones, and his name went out unto a distance, for he had been wonderfully helped till that he had been strong.
\v 16 And at his being strong his heart had been high unto destruction, and he trespasseth against Yahweh his God, and went in unto the temple of Yahweh to make perfume upon the altar of perfume.
\v 17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him priests of Yahweh eighty, sons of valour,
\v 18 and they stand up against Uzziah the king, and say to him, 'Not for thee, O Uzziah, to make perfume to Yahweh, but for priests, sons of Aaron, who are sanctified to make perfume; go forth from the sanctuary, for you hast trespassed, and it is not to thee for honour from Yahweh God.'
\v 19 And Uzziah is wroth, and in his hand is a censer to make perfume, and in his being wroth with the priests — the leprosy had risen in his forehead, before the priests, in the house of Yahweh, from beside the altar of perfume.
\v 20 And Azariah the head priest looketh unto him, and all the priests, and lo, he is leprous in his forehead, and they hasten him there, and also he himself had hastened to go out, for Yahweh had plagued him.
\v 21 And Uzziah the king is a leper unto the day of his death, and inhabiteth a separate house — a leper, for he had been cut off from the house of Yahweh, and Jotham his son is over the house of the king, judging the people of the land.
\v 22 And the rest of the matters of Uzziah, the first and the last, had Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet written;
\v 23 and Uzziah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him with his fathers, in the field of the burying-place that the kings have, for they said, 'He is a leper;' and reign did Jotham his son in his stead.
\c 27
\v 1 A son of twenty and five years is Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
\v 2 And he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Uzziah his father did; only, he had not come in unto the temple of Yahweh; and again are the people doing corruptly.
\v 3 He had built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and in the wall of Ophel he had built abundantly;
\v 4 and cities he had built in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he had built palaces and towers.
\v 5 And he had fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevaileth over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten yousand cors of wheat, and of barley ten yousand; this have the sons of Ammon returned to him both in the second year, and in the third.
\v 6 And Jotham did strengthen himself, for he had prepared his ways before Yahweh his God.
\v 7 And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
\v 8 A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years he had reigned in Jerusalem;
\v 9 and Jotham lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign did Ahaz his son in his stead.
\c 28
\v 1 A son of twenty years is Ahaz in his reigning, and sixteen years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and he had not done that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, as David his father,
\v 2 and walketh in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also, molten images had made for Baalim,
\v 3 and himself had made perfume in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burneth his sons with fire according to the abominations of the nations that Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,
\v 4 and sacrificeth and made perfume in high places, and on the heights, and under every green tree.
\v 5 And Yahweh his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram, and they smite him, and take captive from him a great captivity, and bring them in to Damascus, and also into the hand of the king of Israel he had been given, and he smiteth him — a great smiting.
\v 6 And Pekah son of Remaliah slaid in Judah a hundred and twenty yousand in one day (the whole are sons of valour), because of their forsaking Yahweh, God of their fathers.
\v 7 And Zichri, a mighty one of Ephraim, slaid Maaseiah son of the king, and Azrikam leader of the house, and Elkanah second to the king.
\v 8 And the sons of Israel take captive of their brethren, two hundred yousand, wives, sons and daughters, and also much spoil they have seized from them, and they bring in the spoil to Samaria.
\v 9 And there had been there a prophet of Yahweh (Oded is his name), and he went out before the host that had come in to Samaria, and said to them, 'Lo, in the fury of Yahweh God of your fathers against Judah, He had given them into your hand, and ye slay among them in rage — unto the heavens it had come;
\v 10 and now, sons of Judah and Jerusalem ye are saying to subdue for men-servants and for maid-servants to you; but are there not with you causes of guilt before Yahweh your God?
\v 11 and now, hear me, and send back the captives whom ye have taken captive of your brethren, for the heat of the anger of Yahweh is upon you.'
\v 12 And certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim (Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai), rise up against those coming in from the host,
\v 13 and say to them, 'Ye do not bring in the captives hither, for, to guilt against Yahweh on us, ye are saying to add unto our sin and unto our guilt? for abundant is the guilt we have, and the fierceness of anger on Israel.'
\v 14 And the armed men leave the captives and the prey before the heads and all the assembly;
\v 15 and the men who have been expressed by name rise and take hold on the captives, and all their naked ones they have clothed from the spoil, yea, they clothe them, and shoe them, and cause them to eat and drink, and anoint them, and lead them on asses, even every feeble one, and bring them in to Jericho, the city of palms, near their brethren, and turn back to Samaria.
\v 16 At that time had king Ahaz sent unto the king of Asshur to give help to him;
\v 17 and again the Edomites have come, and smite in Judah, and take captive a captivity.
\v 18 And the Philistines have rushed against the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and capture Beth-Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho and its villages, and Timnah and its villages, and Gimzo and its villages, and dwell there,
\v 19 for Yahweh had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he made free with Judah, even to commit a trespass against Yahweh.
\v 20 And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur came in unto him, and did distress him, and had not strengthened him,
\v 21 yough Ahaz had taken a portion out of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave to the king of Asshur, yet it is no help to him.
\v 22 And in the time of his distress — he addeth to trespass against Yahweh, (this king Ahaz),
\v 23 and he sacrificeth to the gods of Damascus — those smiting him, and said, 'Because the gods of the kings of Aram are helping them, to them I sacrifice, and they help me,' and they have been to him to cause him to stumble, and to all Israel.
\v 24 And Ahaz gathereth the vessels of the house of God, and cutteth in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shutteth the doors of the house of Yahweh, and made to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem.
\v 25 And in every city and city of Judah he had made high places to make perfume to other gods, and provoketh Yahweh, God of his fathers.
\v 26 And the rest of his matters, and all his ways, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\v 27 And Ahaz lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city, in Jerusalem, but have not brought him in to the graves of the kings of Israel, and reign did Hezekiah his son in his stead.
\c 29
\v 1 Hezekiah had reigned — a son of twenty and five years, and twenty and nine years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Abijah daughter of Zechariah;
\v 2 and he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father did.
\v 3 He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, had opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, and strengtheneth them,
\v 4 and brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathereth them to the broad place to the east.
\v 5 And he said to them, 'Hear me, O Levites, now, sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, God of your fathers, and bring out the impurity from the sanctuary,
\v 6 for our fathers have trespassed, and done that which is evil in the eyes of Yahweh our God, and forsake him, and turn round their faces from the tabernacle of Yahweh, and give the neck.
\v 7 Also — they have shut the doors of the porch, and quench the lamps, and perfume they have not made, and burnt-offering have not caused to ascend in the sanctuary to the God of Israel,
\v 8 and the wrath of Yahweh is on Judah and Jerusalem, and He gave them for a trembling, for an astonishment, and for a hissing, as ye are seeing with your eyes.
\v 9 And lo, fallen have our fathers by the sword, and our sons, and our daughters, and our wives are in captivity for this.
\v 10 Now — with my heart — to make a covenant before Yahweh, God of Israel, and the fierceness of His anger did turn back from us.
\v 11 My sons, be not now at rest, for on you had Yahweh fixed to stand before Him, to serve Him, and to be to Him ministering and making perfume.'
\v 12 And the Levites rise — Mahad son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohadite; and of the sons of Merari: Kish son of Abdi, and Azariah son of Jehalelel; and of the Gershonite: Joah son of Zimmah, and Eden son of Joah;
\v 13 and of the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri, and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;
\v 14 and of the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel — 
\v 15 and they gather their brethren, and sanctify themselves, and come in, according to the command of the king in the matters of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh,
\v 16 and the priests come in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh to cleanse it, and bring out all the uncleanness that they have found in the temple of Yahweh to the court of the house of Yahweh, and the Levites receive it, to take it out to the brook Kidron wiyout.
\v 17 And they begin on the first of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they have come to the porch of Yahweh, and they sanctify the house of Yahweh in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they have finished.
\v 18 And they come in within unto Hezekiah the king, and say, 'We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh, and the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and the table of the arrangement, and all its vessels,
\v 19 and all the vessels that king Ahaz cast away in his reign — in his trespass — we have prepared and sanctified, and lo, they are before the altar of Yahweh.'
\v 20 And Hezekiah the king riseth early, and gathereth the heads of the city, and went up to the house of Yahweh;
\v 21 and they bring in seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven young he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah; and he said to sons of Aaron, the priests, to cause them to ascend on the altar of Yahweh.
\v 22 And they slaughter the oxen, and the priests receive the blood, and sprinkle on the altar; and they slaughter the rams, and sprinkle the blood on the altar; and they slaughter the lambs, and sprinkle the blood on the altar;
\v 23 and they bring nigh the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the assembly, and they lay their hands upon them;
\v 24 and the priests slaughter them, and make a sin-offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel, for 'For all Israel,' said the king, 'is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.'
\v 25 And he appointeth the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, by the command of David, and of Gad, seer of the king, and of Nathan the prophet, for by the hand of Yahweh is the command, by the hand of His prophets;
\v 26 and the Levites stand with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\v 27 And Hezekiah said to cause the burnt-offering to ascend on the altar; and at the time the burnt-offering began — began the song of Yahweh, and the trumpets, even by the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel.
\v 28 And all the assembly are doing obeisance, and the singers singing, and the trumpeters blowing; the whole is till the completion of the burnt-offering.
\v 29 And at the completion of the offering up bowed have the king and all those found with him, and do obeisance.
\v 30 And Hezekiah the king said, and the princes, to the Levites to give praise to Yahweh in the words of David, and of Asaph the seer, and they praise — unto joy, and they bow, and do obeisance.
\v 31 And Hezekiah answereth and said, 'Now ye have filled your hand to Yahweh, come nigh, and bring in sacrifices and thank-offerings to the house of Yahweh;' and the assembly bring in sacrifices and thank-offerings, and every willing-hearted one — burnt-offerings.
\v 32 And the number of the burnt-offerings that the assembly have brought in, is seventy oxen, a hundred rams, lambs two hundred; for a burnt-offering to Yahweh are all these.
\v 33 And the sanctified things are oxen six hundred, and sheep three yousand.
\v 34 Only, the priests have become few, and have not been able to strip the whole of the burnt-offerings, and their brethren the Levites strengthen them till the completion of the work, and till the priests sanctify themselves, for the Levites are more upright of heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\v 35 And also, burnt-offerings are in abundance, with fat of the peace-offerings, and with oblations for the burnt-offering; and the service of the house of Yahweh is established,
\v 36 and rejoice did Hezekiah and all the people, because of God's giving preparation to the people, for the thing had been suddenly.
\c 30
\v 1 And Hezekiah sent unto all Israel and Judah, and also letters he had written unto Ephraim and Manasseh, to come in to the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, to make a passover to Yahweh, God of Israel.
\v 2 And the king taketh counsel, and his heads, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to make the passover in the second month,
\v 3 for they have not been able to make it at that time, for the priests have not sanctified themselves sufficiently, and the people have not been gathered to Jerusalem.
\v 4 And the thing is right in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of all the assembly,
\v 5 and they establish the thing, to cause to pass over an intimation into all Israel, from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, to come in to make a passover to Yahweh, God of Israel, in Jerusalem, for not for a long time had they done as it is written.
\v 6 And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king and his heads, into all Israel and Judah, even according to the command of the king, saying, 'O sons of Israel, turn back unto Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He did turn back unto the escaped part that is left of you from the hand of the kings of Asshur;
\v 7 and do not be like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Yahweh, God of their fathers, and He gave them to desolation, as ye do see.
\v 8 'Now, harden not your neck like your fathers, give a hand to Yahweh, and come in to His sanctuary, that He had sanctified to the age, and serve Yahweh your God, and the fierceness of His anger did turn back from you;
\v 9 for in your turning back unto Yahweh, your brethren and your sons have mercies before their captors, even to return to this land, for gracious and merciful is Yahweh your God, and He did not turn aside the face from you, if ye turn back unto Him.'
\v 10 And the runners are passing over from city to city, in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: and they are laughing at them, and mocking at them,
\v 11 only, certain from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun, have been humbled, and come in to Jerusalem.
\v 12 Also, in Judah had the hand of God been to give to them one heart to do the command of the king and of the heads, in the matter of Yahweh;
\v 13 and much people are gathered to Jerusalem, to make the feast of unleavened things in the second month — a mighty assembly for multitude.
\v 14 And they arise and turn aside the altars that are in Jerusalem, and all the perfume altars they have turned aside, and cast them to the brook Kidron;
\v 15 and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the second month, and the priests and the Levites have been ashamed, and sanctify themselves, and bring in burnt-offerings to the house of Yahweh.
\v 16 And they stand on their station according to their ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the Levites,
\v 17 for many are in the assembly who have not sanctified themselves, and the Levites are over the slaughtering of the passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify him to Yahweh:
\v 18 for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, 'Yahweh, who is good, did receive atonement for every one
\v 19 who had prepared his heart to seek God — Yahweh, God of his fathers — yet not according to the cleansing of the sanctuary;'
\v 20 and Yahweh hearkeneth unto Hezekiah, and healeth the people.
\v 21 And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, make the feast of unleavened things seven days with great joy; and giving praise to Yahweh day by day are the Levites and the priests, with instruments of praise before Yahweh.
\v 22 And Hezekiah spoke unto the heart of all the Levites, those giving good understanding concerning Yahweh, and they eat the appointed thing seven days; sacrificing sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, God of their fathers.
\v 23 And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven days, and they keep seven days with joy;
\v 24 for Hezekiah king of Judah had presented to the assembly a yousand bullocks, and seven yousand sheep; and the heads have presented to the assembly bullocks a yousand, and sheep ten yousand; and priests sanctify themselves in abundance.
\v 25 And all the assembly of Judah rejoice, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the assembly, those coming in from Israel, and the sojourners, those coming in from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah,
\v 26 and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in Jerusalem,
\v 27 and the priests, the Levites, rise and bless the people, and their voice is heard, and their prayer came in to His holy habitation, to the heavens.
\c 31
\v 1 And at the completion of all this, gone out have all Israel who are found present to the cities of Judah, and break the standing-pillars, and cut down the shrines, and break down the high places and the altars, out of all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, even to completion, and all the sons of Israel turn back, each to his Possession, to their cities.
\v 2 And Hezekiah appointeth the courses of the priests, and of the Levites, by their courses, each according to his service, of the priests and of the Levites, for burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to give praise in the gates of the camps of Yahweh.
\v 3 And a portion of the king, from his substance, is for burnt-offerings, for burnt-offerings of the morning, and of the evening, and the burnt-offerings of sabbaths, and of new moons, and of appointed seasons, as it is written in the law of Yahweh.
\v 4 And he said to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests, and of the Levites, so that they are strengthened in the law of Yahweh;
\v 5 and at the spreading forth of the thing have the sons of Israel multiplied the first-fruit of corn, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field, and the tithe of the whole in abundance they have brought in.
\v 6 And the sons of Israel and Judah, those dwelling in cities of Judah, they also a tithe of herd and flock, and a tithe of the holy things that are sanctified to Yahweh their God, have brought in, and they give — heaps, heaps;
\v 7 in the third month they have begun to lay the foundation of the heaps, and in the seventh month they have finished.
\v 8 And Hezekiah and the heads come in and see the heaps, and bless Yahweh and His people Israel,
\v 9 and Hezekiah inquireth at the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps,
\v 10 and Azariah the head priest, of the house of Zadok, spoke unto him, and said, 'From the beginning of the bringing of the heave-offering to the house of Yahweh, there is to eat, and to be satisfied, and to leave abundantly, for Yahweh had blessed His people, and that left is this store.'
\v 11 And Hezekiah said to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh, and they prepare,
\v 12 and they bring in the heave-offering, and the tithe, and the holy things faithfully; and over them is a leader, Conaniah the Levite, and Shimei his brother is second;
\v 13 and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahad, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahad, and Benaiah, are inspectors under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah leader of the house of God.
\v 14 And Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east, is over the willing-offerings of God, to give the heave-offering of Yahweh, and the most holy things.
\v 15 And by his hand are Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shechaniah, in cities of the priests, faithfully to give to their brethren in courses, as the great so the small,
\v 16 apart from their genealogy, to males from a son of three years and upward, to every one who had gone in to the house of Yahweh, by the matter of a day in its day, for their service in their charges, according to their courses;
\v 17 and the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and of the Levites, from a son of twenty years and upward, in their charges, in their courses;
\v 18 and to the genealogy among all their infants, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters to all the congregation, for in their faithfulness they sanctify themselves in holiness.
\v 19 And to sons of Aaron, the priests, in the fields of the suburb of their cities, in every city and city, are men who have been defined by name, to give portions to every male among the priests, and to every one who reckoned himself by genealogy among the Levites.
\v 20 And Hezekiah did thus in all Judah, and did that which is good, and that which is right, and that which is true, before Yahweh his God;
\v 21 and in every work that he had begun for the service of the house of God, and for the law, and for the command, to seek to his God, with all his heart he had wrought and prospered.
\c 32
\v 1 After these things and this truth, come had Sennacherib king of Asshur, yea, he came in to Judah, and encampeth against the cities of the bulwarks, and said to rend them unto himself.
\v 2 And Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and his face is to the battle against Jerusalem,
\v 3 and he taketh counsel with his heads and his mighty ones, to stop the waters of the fountains that are at the outside of the city — and they help him,
\v 4 and much people are gathered, and they stop all the fountains and the brook that is rushing into the middle of the land, saying, 'Why do the kings of Asshur come, and have found much water?'
\v 5 And he strengtheneth himself, and built the whole of the wall that is broken, and caused it to ascend unto the towers, and at the outside of the wall another, and strengtheneth Millo, in the city of David, and made darts in abundance, and shields.
\v 6 And he putteth heads of war over the people, and gathereth them unto him, unto the broad place of a gate of the city, and spoke unto their heart, saying,
\v 7 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid, nor be cast down from the face of the king of Asshur, and from the face of all the multitude that is with him, for with us are more than with him.
\v 8 With him is an arm of flesh, and with us is Yahweh our God, to help us, and to fight our battles;' and the people are supported by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\v 9 After this had Sennacherib king of Asshur sent his servants to Jerusalem — and he is by Lachish, and all his power with him — against Hezekiah king of Judah, and against all Judah, who are in Jerusalem, saying,
\v 10 'Thus said Sennacherib king of Asshur, On what are ye trusting and abiding in the bulwark, in Jerusalem?
\v 11 'Is not Hezekiah persuading you, to give you up to die by famine, and by thirst, saying, Yahweh our God did deliver us from the hand of the king of Asshur?
\v 12 Hath not Hezekiah himself turned aside His high places, and His altars, and spoke to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar ye bow yourselves, and on it ye make perfume?
\v 13 Do ye not know what I have done — I and my fathers — to all peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?
\v 14 Who among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers have devoted to destruction is he who had been able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God is able to deliver you out of my hand?
\v 15 'And, now, let not Hezekiah lift you up, nor persuade you thus, nor give credence to him, for no god of any nation and kingdom is able to deliver his people from my hand, and from the hand of my fathers: also, surely your God did not deliver you from my hand!'
\v 16 And again have his servants spoken against Yahweh God, and against Hezekiah His servant,
\v 17 and letters he had written to give reproach to Yahweh, God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, 'As the gods of the nations of the lands that have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah did not deliver His people from my hand.'
\v 18 And they call with a great voice in Jewish, against the people of Jerusalem who are on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them, that they may capture the city,
\v 19 and they speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land — work of the hands of man.
\v 20 And Hezekiah the king prayeth, and Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, concerning this, and they cry to the heavens,
\v 21 and Yahweh sent a messenger, and cutteth off every mighty one of valour — both leader and head — in the camp of the king of Asshur, and he turneth back with shame of face to his land, and entereth the house of his god, and those coming out of his bowels have caused him to fall there by the sword.
\v 22 And Yahweh saveth Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur, and from the hand of all, and He leadeth them round about;
\v 23 and many are bringing in an offering to Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, and he is lifted up before the eyes of all the nations after this.
\v 24 In those days had Hezekiah been sick even unto death, and he prayeth unto Yahweh, and He spoke to him, and a wonder had appointed for him;
\v 25 and Hezekiah had not returned according to the deed done unto him, for his heart had been lofty, and there is wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem;
\v 26 and Hezekiah is humbled for the loftiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Yahweh had not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\v 27 And Hezekiah had riches and honour very much, and treasures he had made to himself of silver, and of gold, and of precious stone, and of spices, and of shields, and of all kinds of desirable vessels,
\v 28 and storehouses for the increase of corn, and new wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and herds for stalls;
\v 29 and cities he had made for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given to him very much substance.
\v 30 And Hezekiah himself had stopped the upper source of the waters of Gihon, and directeth them beneath to the west of the city of David, and Hezekiah prospereth in all his work;
\v 31 and so with the ambassadors of the heads of Babylon, those sending unto him to inquire of the wonder that had been in the land, God had left him to try him, to know all in his heart,
\v 32 And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and his kind acts, lo, they are written in the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\v 33 And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the uppermost of the graves of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have done honour to him at his death, and reign did Manasseh his son in his stead.
\c 33
\v 1 A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he had reigned in Jerusalem;
\v 2 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, like the abominations of the nations that Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,
\v 3 and he turneth and built the high places that Hezekiah his father had broken down, and raiseth altars for Baalim, and made shrines, and boweth himself to all the host of the heavens, and serveth them.
\v 4 And he had built altars in the house of Yahweh of which Yahweh had said, 'In Jerusalem is My name to the age.'
\v 5 And he built altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 And he had caused his sons to pass over through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and observed clouds and used enchantments and witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and a wizard; he had multiplied to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.
\v 7 And he placeth the graven image of the idol that he made in the house of God, of which God said unto David, and unto Solomon his son, 'In this house, and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name to the age,
\v 8 and I add not to turn aside the foot of Israel from off the ground that I appointed to your fathers, only, if they watch to do all that I have commanded them — to all the law, and the statutes, and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.'
\v 9 And Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, to do evil above the nations that Yahweh destroyed from the presence of the sons of Israel.
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke unto Manasseh and unto his people, and they have not attended,
\v 11 and Yahweh brought in against them the heads of the host that the king of Asshur had, and they capture Manasseh among the thickets, and bind him with brazen fetters, and cause him to go to Babylon.
\v 12 And when he is in distress he had appeased the face of Yahweh his God, and is humbled exceedingly before the God of his fathers,
\v 13 and prayeth unto Him, and He is entreated of him, and heareth his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom, and Manasseh knoweth that Yahweh — He is God.
\v 14 And after this he had built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entering in at the fish-gate, and it had gone round to the tower, and he made it exceeding high, and he putteth heads of the force in all the cities of the bulwarks in Judah.
\v 15 And he turneth aside the gods of the stranger, and the idol, out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Yahweh and in Jerusalem, and threw them to the outside of the city.
\v 16 And he built the altar of Yahweh, and sacrificeth upon it sacrifices of peace-offerings and thank-offering, and said to Judah to serve Yahweh, God of Israel;
\v 17 but still the people are sacrificing in high places, only — to Yahweh their God.
\v 18 And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the matters of the seers, those speaking unto him in the name of Yahweh, God of Israel, lo, they are on the book of the matters of the kings of Israel;
\v 19 and his prayer, and his entreaty, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he had built high places, and established the shrines and the graven images before his being humbled, lo, they are written beside the matters of Hozai.
\v 20 And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in his own house, and reign did Amon his son in his stead.
\v 21 A son of twenty and two years is Amon in his reigning, and two years he had reigned in Jerusalem,
\v 22 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father, and to all the graven images that Manasseh his father had made had Amon sacrificed, and serveth them,
\v 23 and had not been humbled before Yahweh, like the humbling of Manasseh his father, for Amon himself had multiplied guilt.
\v 24 And his servants conspire against him, and put him to death in his own house,
\v 25 and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his son to reign in his stead.
\c 34
\v 1 A son of eight years is Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he had reigned in Jerusalem,
\v 2 and he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walketh in the ways of David his father, and had not turned aside — right or left.
\v 3 And in the eighth year of his reign (and he yet a youth), he had begun to seek to the God of David his father, and in the twelfth year he had begun to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images.
\v 4 And they break down before him the altars of the Baalim, and the images that are on high above them he had cut down, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images, he had broken and beaten small, and streweth on the surface of the graves of those sacrificing to them,
\v 5 and the bones of the priests he had burnt on their altars, and cleanseth Judah and Jerusalem,
\v 6 and in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their tools, round about.
\v 7 And he breaketh down the altars and the shrines, and the graven images he had beaten down very small, and all the images he had cut down in all the land of Israel, and turneth back to Jerusalem.
\v 8 And in the eighteenth year of his reign, to purify the land and the house he had sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah head of the city, and Joah son of Johaz the remembrancer, to strengthen the house of Yahweh his God.
\v 9 And they come in unto Hilkiah the high priest, and they give the money that is brought in to the house of God, that the Levites, keeping the threshold, have gathered from the hand of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
\v 10 and they give it into the hand of the workmen, those appointed over the house of Yahweh, and they give it to the workmen who are working in the house of Yahweh, to repair and to strengthen the house;
\v 11 and they give it to artificers, and to builders, to buy hewn stones, and wood for couplings and for beams to the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\v 12 And the men are working faithfully in the business, and over them are appointed Jahad and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohadite, to overlook; and of the Levites, every one understanding about instruments of song,
\v 13 and over the burden-bearers, and overseers of every one doing work for service and service; and of the Levites are scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers.
\v 14 And in their bringing out the money that is brought in to the house of Yahweh, had Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Yahweh by the hand of Moses,
\v 15 and Hilkiah answereth and said unto Shaphan the scribe, 'A book of the law I have found in the house of Yahweh;' and Hilkiah gave the book unto Shaphan,
\v 16 and Shaphan brought in the book unto the king, and brought the king back word again, saying, 'All that had been given into the hand of your servants they are doing,
\v 17 and they pour out the money that is found in the house of Yahweh, and give it into the hand of those appointed, and into the hands of those doing the work.'
\v 18 And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, 'A book had Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth in it before the king.
\v 19 And it came to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the law, that he rendeth his garments,
\v 20 and the king commandeth Hilkiah, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, servant of the king, saying,
\v 21 Go, seek Yahweh for me, and for him who is left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found, for great is the fury of Yahweh that is poured on us, because that our fathers kept not the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written on this book.'
\v 22 And Hilkiah went, and they of the king, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the garments, and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the Second, and they speak unto her thus.
\v 23 And she said to them, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Say to the man who had sent you unto me,
\v 24 Thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am bringing in evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, all the execrations that are written on the book that they read before the king of Judah;
\v 25 because that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, so as to provoke Me with all the works of their hands, and poured out is My fury upon this place, and it is not quenched.
\v 26 'And unto the king of Judah, who is sending you to inquire of Yahweh, thus do ye say unto him: Thus said Yahweh God of Israel, whose words you hast heard:
\v 27 Because your heart is tender, and you art humbled before God in your hearing His words concerning this place, and concerning its inhabitants, and art humbled before Me, and will rend your garments, and weep before Me: even I also have heard — the affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 28 Lo, I am gathering thee unto your fathers, and you hast been gathered unto your graves in peace, and yours eyes do not look on all the evil that I am bringing upon this place, and upon its inhabitants;' and they bring the king back word.
\v 29 And the king sent and gathereth all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem,
\v 30 and the king went up to the house of Yahweh, and every man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, even all the people, from great even unto small, and he readeth in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that is found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 31 And the king standeth on his station, and made the covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep His commands, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that are written on this book.
\v 32 And he presenteth every one who is found in Jerusalem and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem do according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\v 33 And Josiah turneth aside all the abominations out of all the lands that the sons of Israel have, and caused every one who is found in Israel to serve, to serve Yahweh their God; all his days they turned not aside from after Yahweh, God of their fathers.
\c 35
\v 1 And Josiah made in Jerusalem a passover to Yahweh, and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the first month,
\v 2 and he stationeth the priests over their charges, and strengtheneth them for the service of the house of Yahweh,
\v 3 and said to the Levites — who are teaching all Israel — who are sanctified to Yahweh, 'Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon son of David king of Israel built; it is not to you a burden on the shoulder. 'Now, serve Yahweh your God, and His people Israel,
\v 4 and prepare, by the house of your fathers, according to your courses, by the writing of David king of Israel, and by the writing of Solomon his son,
\v 5 and stand in the sanctuary, by the divisions of the house of the fathers of your brethren, sons of the people, and the portion of the house of a father of the Levites,
\v 6 and slaughter the passover-offering and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.'
\v 7 And Josiah lifteth up to the sons of the people a flock of lambs and young goats, the whole for passover-offerings, for every one who is found, to the number of thirty yousand, and oxen three yousand: these are from the substance of the king.
\v 8 And his heads, for a willing-offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites, have lifted up; Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, leaders in the house of God, to the priests have given for passover-offerings two yousand and six hundred, and oxen three hundred;
\v 9 and Conaniah, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, have lifted up to the Levites, for passover-offerings, five yousand, and oxen five hundred.
\v 10 And the service is prepared, and the priests stand on their station, and the Levites on their courses, according to the command of the king,
\v 11 and they slaughter the passover-offering, and the priests sprinkle out of their hand, and the Levites are striping;
\v 12 and they turn aside the burnt-offering, to put them by the divisions of the house of the fathers of the sons of the people, to bring near to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses — and so to the oxen.
\v 13 And they cook the passover with fire, according to the ordinance, and the sanctified things they have cooked in pots, and in kettles, and in pans — for all the sons of the people.
\v 14 And afterward they have prepared for themselves, and for the priests: for the priests, sons of Aaron, are in the offering up of the burnt-offering and of the fat till night; and the Levites have prepared for themselves, and for the priests, sons of Aaron.
\v 15 And the singers, sons of Asaph, are on their station, according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun seer of the king, and the gate keepers are at gate and gate; it is not for them to turn aside from off their service, for their brethren the Levites have prepared for them.
\v 16 And all the service of Yahweh is prepared on that day, to keep the passover, and to cause to ascend burnt-offering upon the altar of Yahweh, according to the command of king Josiah.
\v 17 And the sons of Israel who are found make the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened things, seven days.
\v 18 And there had not been made a passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, and none of the kings of Israel made such a passover as Josiah had made, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who are found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah had this passover been made.
\v 20 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, come up had Necho king of Egypt, to fight against Carchemish by Phrat, and Josiah went forth to meet him;
\v 21 and he sent unto him messengers, saying, 'What — to me and to thee, O king of Judah? not against thee do I come to-day, but unto the house with which I have war, and God said to haste me; cease for thee from God who is with me, and He did not destroy thee.'
\v 22 And Josiah had not turned round his face from him, but to fight against him had disguised himself, and had not hearkened unto the words of Necho, from the mouth of God, and came in to fight in the valley of Megiddo;
\v 23 and the archers shoot at king Josiah, and the king said to his servants, 'Remove me, for I have become very sick.'
\v 24 And his servants remove him from the chariot, and cause him to ride on the second chariot that he had, and cause him to go to Jerusalem, and he dieth, and is buried in the graves of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem are mourning for Josiah,
\v 25 and Jeremiah lamenteth for Josiah, and all the singers and the songstresses speak in their lamentations of Josiah unto this day, and set them for a statute on Israel, and lo, they are written beside the lamentations.
\v 26 And the rest of the matters of Josiah, and his kind acts, according as it is written in the law of Yahweh,
\v 27 even his matters, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
\c 36
\v 1 And the people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and cause him to reign instead of his father in Jerusalem.
\v 2 A son of three and twenty years is Jehoahaz in his reigning, and three months he had reigned in Jerusalem,
\v 3 and turn him aside did the king of Egypt in Jerusalem, and fineth the land a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold;
\v 4 and the king of Egypt caused Eliakim his brother to reign over Judah and Jerusalem, and turneth his name to Jehoiakim; and Jehoahaz his brother had Necho taken, and brought him in to Egypt.
\v 5 A son of twenty and five years is Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh his God;
\v 6 against him had Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up, and bindeth him in brazen fetters to take him away to Babylon.
\v 7 And of the vessels of the house of Yahweh had Nebuchadnezzar brought in to Babylon, and putteth them in his temple in Babylon.
\v 8 And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim, and his abominations that he had done, and that which is found against him, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, and reign did Jehoiachin his son in his stead.
\v 9 A son of eight years is Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months and ten days he had reigned in Jerusalem, and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh;
\v 10 and at the turn of the year had king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him in to Babylon, with the desirable vessels of the house of Yahweh, and caused Zedekiah his brother to reign over Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 11 A son of twenty and one years is Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he had reigned in Jerusalem;
\v 12 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh his God, he had not been humbled before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh;
\v 13 and also, against king Nebuchadnezzar he had rebelled, who had caused him to swear by God, and he hardeneth his neck, and strengtheneth his heart, against turning back unto Yahweh, God of Israel.
\v 14 Also, all the heads of the priests, and the people, having multiplied to commit a trespass according to all the abominations of the nations, and they defile the house of Yahweh that He had sanctified in Jerusalem.
\v 15 And Yahweh, God of their fathers, sent unto them by the hand of His messengers — rising early and sending — for He had had pity on His people, and on His habitation,
\v 16 and they are mocking at the messengers of God, and despising His words, and acting deceitfully with His prophets, till the going up of the fury of Yahweh against His people — till there is no healing.
\v 17 And He caused to go up against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he slaid their chosen ones by the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had had no pity on young man and virgin, old man and very aged — the whole He had given into his hand.
\v 18 And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king and of his princes — the whole he had brought in to Babylon.
\v 19 And they burn the house of God, and break down the wall of Jerusalem, and all its palaces they have burnt with fire, and all its desirable vessels — to destruction.
\v 20 And he removeth those left of the sword unto Babylon, and they are to him and to his sons for servants, till the reigning of the kingdom of Persia,
\v 21 to fulfil the word of Yahweh in the mouth of Jeremiah, till the land had enjoyed its sabbaths; all the days of the desolation it kept sabbath — to the fulness of seventy years.
\v 22 And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, at the completion of the word of Yahweh in the mouth of Jeremiah, had Yahweh waked up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he caused an intimation to pass over into all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,
\v 23 Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All kingdoms of the earth had Yahweh, God of the heavens, given to me, and He had laid a charge on me to build to Him a house in Jerusalem, that is in Judah; who is among you of all His people? Yahweh his God is with him, and he did go up.'
