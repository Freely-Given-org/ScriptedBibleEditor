\c 1
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth of the month, and I am in the middle of the Removed by the river Chebar, the heavens have been opened, and I see visions of God.
\v 2 In the fifth of the month — it is the fifth year of the removal of the king Jehoiachin — 
\v 3 had the word of Yahweh certainly been unto Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar, and there is on him there a hand of Yahweh.
\v 4 And I look, and behold, a tempestuous wind is coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire catching itself, and brightness to it round about, and out of its middle as the colour of copper, out of the middle of the fire.
\v 5 And out of its middle is a likeness of four living creatures, and this is their appearance; a likeness of man is to them,
\v 6 and four faces are to each, and four wings are to each of them,
\v 7 and their feet are straight feet, and the sole of their feet is as a sole of a calf's foot, and they are sparkling as the colour of bright brass;
\v 8 and hands of man under their wings — on their four sides, and their faces and their wings — are to them four;
\v 9 joining one unto another are their wings, they turn not round in their going, each straight forward they go.
\v 10 As to the likeness of their faces, the face of a man, and the face of a lion, toward the right are to them four, and the face of an ox on the left are to them four, and the face of an eagle are to them four.
\v 11 And their faces and their wings are separate from above, to each are two joining together, and two are covering their bodies.
\v 12 And each straight forward they go, where the spirit is to go, they go, they turn not round in their going.
\v 13 As to the likeness of the living creatures, their appearances are as coals of fire — burning as the appearance of lamps; it is going up and down between the living creatures, and brightness is to the fire, and out of the fire is going forth lightning.
\v 14 And the living creatures are running, and turning back, as the appearance of the flash.
\v 15 And I see the living creatures, and behold, one wheel is in the earth, near the living creatures, at its four faces.
\v 16 The appearance of the wheels and their works is as the colour of beryl, and one likeness is to them four, and their appearances and their works are as it were the wheel in the middle of the wheel.
\v 17 On their four sides, in their going they go, they turn not round in their going.
\v 18 As to their rings, they are both high and fearful, and their rings are full of eyes round about them four.
\v 19 And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels go beside them, and in the living creatures being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are the wheels.
\v 20 Whither the spirit is to go, they go, thither the spirit is to go, and the wheels are lifted up over-against them, for a living spirit is in the wheels.
\v 21 In their going, they go; and in their standing, they stand; and in their being lifted up from off the earth, lifted up are the wheels over-against them; for a living spirit is in the wheels.
\v 22 And a likeness is over the heads of the living creatures of an expanse, as the colour of the fearful ice, stretched out over their heads from above.
\v 23 And under the expanse their wings are straight, one toward the other, to each are two covering on this side, and to each are two covering on that side — their bodies.
\v 24 And I hear the noise of their wings, as the noise of many waters, as the noise of the Mighty One, in their going — the noise of tumult, as the noise of a camp, in their standing they let fall their wings.
\v 25 And there is a voice from above the expanse, that is above their head: in their standing they let fall their wings.
\v 26 And above the expanse that is over their head, as an appearance of a sapphire stone, is the likeness of a throne, and on the likeness of the throne a likeness, as the appearance of man upon it from above.
\v 27 And I see as the colour of copper, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I have seen as the appearance of fire, and brightness is to it round about.
\v 28 As the appearance of the bow that is in a cloud in a day of rain, so is the appearance of the brightness round about.
\c 2
\v 1 It is the appearance of the likeness of the honour of Yahweh, and I see, and fall on my face, and I hear a voice speaking, and He said unto me, 'Son of man, stand on your feet, and I speak with you.'
\v 2 And there did come into me a spirit, when He had spoken unto me, and it caused me to stand on my feet, and I hear Him who is speaking unto me.
\v 3 And He said unto Me, 'Son of man, I am sending you unto the sons of Israel, unto nations who are rebels, who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, unto this self-same day.
\v 4 And the sons are brazen-faced and hard-hearted to whom I am sending you, and you hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh:
\v 5 and they — whether they hear, or whether they forbear, for a rebellious house they are — have known that a prophet had been in their middle.
\v 6 And you, son of man, you are not afraid of them, yea, of their words you are not afraid, for briers and thorns are with you, and near scorpions you are dwelling, of their words you are not afraid, and of their faces you are not frightened, for they are a rebellious house,
\v 7 And you hast spoken My words unto them, whether they hear or whether they forbear, for they are rebellious.
\v 8 'And you, son of man, hear that which I am speaking unto you: You are not rebellious like the rebellious house, open your mouth, and eat that which I am giving unto you.'
\v 9 And I look, and behold, a hand is sent forth unto me, and behold, in it a roll of a book,
\v 10 and He spreadeth it before me, and it is written in front and behind, and written on it are lamentations, and mourning, and woe!
\c 3
\v 1 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, that which you findest eat, eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.'
\v 2 And I open my mouth, and He caused me to eat this roll.
\v 3 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, your belly you will feed, and your bowels you will fill with this roll that I am giving unto you;' and I eat it, and it is in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
\v 4 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, go, enter in unto the house of Israel, and you hast spoken with My words unto them.
\v 5 For, not unto a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue are you sent — unto the house of Israel;
\v 6 not unto many peoples, deep of lip and heavy of tongue, whose words you will not understand. If I had not sent you unto them — they, they do hearken unto you,
\v 7 but the house of Israel are not willing to hearken unto you, for they are not willing to hearken unto Me, for all the house of Israel are brazen-faced and strong-hearted.
\v 8 'Lo, I have made your face strong against their face, and your forehead strong against their forehead.
\v 9 As an adamant harder than a rock I have made your forehead; you will not fear them, nor are you frightened before them, for a rebellious house are they.'
\v 10 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, all My words, that I speak unto you, receive with your heart, and with yours ears hear;
\v 11 and go, enter in unto the Removed, unto the sons of your people, and you hast spoken unto them, and hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: whether they hear, or whether they forbear.'
\v 12 And lift me up did a spirit, and I hear behind me a noise, a great rushing — 'Blessed is the honour of Yahweh from His place!' — 
\v 13 even a noise of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and a noise of the wheels over-against them, even a noise of a great rushing.
\v 14 And a spirit had lifted me up, and did take me away, and I go bitterly, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Yahweh on me is strong.
\v 15 And I come in unto the Removed, at Tel-Ahib, who are dwelling at the river Chebar, and where they are dwelling I also dwell seven days, causing astonishment in their middle.
\v 16 And it came to pass, at the end of seven days,
\v 17 that there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying, 'Son of man, a watchman I have given you to the house of Israel, and you hast heard from My mouth a word, and hast warned them from Me.
\v 18 In My saying to the wicked: You will surely die; and you hast not warned him, nor hast spoken to warn the wicked from his wicked way, so that he did live; he — the wicked — in his iniquity dieth, and his blood from your hand I require.
\v 19 And you, because you hast warned the wicked, and he had not turned back from his wickedness, and from his wicked way, he in his iniquity dieth, and you your soul hast delivered.
\v 20 'And in the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness, and he had done perversity, and I have put a stumbling-block before him, he dieth; because you hast not warned him, in his sin he dieth, and not remembered is his righteousness that he had done, and his blood from your hand I require.
\v 21 And you, because you hast warned him — the righteous — that the righteous sin not, and he had not sinned, he surely lived, because he had been warned; and you your soul hast delivered.'
\v 22 And there is on me there a hand of Yahweh, and He said to me, 'Rise, go forth to the valley, and there I do speak with you.'
\v 23 And I rise and go forth unto the valley, and behold, there the honour of Yahweh is standing as the honour that I had seen by the river Chebar, and I fall on my face.
\v 24 And come into me did a spirit, and caused me to stand on my feet, and He spoke with me, and said unto me, 'Go in, be shut up in the middle of your house.
\v 25 'And you, son of man, behold, they have put on you thick bands, and have bound you with them, and you goest not forth in their middle;
\v 26 and your tongue I cause to cleave unto your palate, and you hast been dumb, and are not to them for a reprover, for a rebellious house are they.
\v 27 And in My speaking with you, I do open your mouth, and you hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh; the hearer did hear, and the forbearer did forbear; for a rebellious house are they.
\c 4
\v 1 And you, son of man, take to you a brick, and you hast put it before you, and hast graven on it a city — Jerusalem,
\v 2 and hast placed against it a siege, and builded against it a fortification, and poured out against it a mount, and placed against it camps, yea, set you against it battering-rams round about.
\v 3 And you, take to you an iron pan, and you hast made it a wall of iron between you and the city; and you hast prepared your face against it, and it had been in a siege, yea, you hast laid siege against it. A sign it is to the house of Israel.
\v 4 'And you, lie on your left side, and you hast placed the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; the number of the days that you liest on it, you bearest their iniquity.
\v 5 And I — I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, the number of days, three hundred and ninety days; and you hast borne the iniquity of the house of Israel.
\v 6 And you hast completed these, and hast lain on your right side, a second time, and hast borne the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days — a day for a year — a day for a year I have appointed to you.
\v 7 And unto the siege of Jerusalem you will prepare your face, and yours arm is uncovered, and you hast prophesied concerning it.
\v 8 And behold, I have put on you thick bands, and you will not turn from side to side till your completing the days of your siege.
\v 9 And you, take to you wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and you hast put them in one vessel, and made them to you for bread; the number of the days that you are lying on your side — three hundred and ninety days — you will eat it.
\v 10 And your food that you will eat is by weight, twenty shekels daily; from time to time you will eat it.
\v 11 And water by measure you will drink, a sixth part of the hin; from time to time you will drink it.
\v 12 A barley-cake you will eat it, and it with dung — the filth of man — you will bake before their eyes.
\v 13 And Yahweh said, 'Thus do the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations where I drive them.'
\v 14 And I say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, behold, my soul is not defiled, and carcase, and torn thing, I have not eaten from my youth, even till now; nor come into my mouth had abominable flesh.'
\v 15 And He said unto me, 'See, I have given to you bullock's dung instead of man's dung, and you hast made your bread by it.'
\v 16 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, behold, I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they have eaten bread by weight and with fear; and water by measure and with astonishment, they do drink;
\v 17 so that they lack bread and water, and have been astonished one with another, and been consumed in their iniquity.
\c 5
\v 1 And you, son of man, take to you a sharp weapon, the barber's razor you will take to you, and you hast caused it to pass over your head, and over your beard, and you hast taken to you weighing scales, and apportioned them.
\v 2 A third part with fire you will burn in the middle of the city, at the fulness of the days of the siege; and you hast taken the third part, you will smite with a weapon round about it; and the third part you will scatter to the wind, and a weapon I draw out after them.
\v 3 And you hast taken there a few in number — and hast bound them in your skirts;
\v 4 and of them you will take again, and hast cast them unto the middle of the fire, and hast burned them in the fire — out of it came forth a fire unto all the house of Israel.
\v 5 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: this is Jerusalem, In the middle of the nations I have set her, And round about her are the lands.
\v 6 And she changeth My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, And My statutes more than the lands that are round about her, For against My judgments they have kicked, And My statutes — they have not walked in them.
\v 7 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your multiplying above the nations that are around you, In My statutes you have not walked, And My judgments you have not done, According to the judgments of the nations That are round about you you have not done.
\v 8 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, even I, And I have done in your middle judgments, Before the eyes of the nations.
\v 9 And I have done in you that which I have not done, And that which I do not its like again, Because of all yours abominations.
\v 10 Therefore fathers do eat sons in your middle, And sons eat their fathers, And I have done in you judgments, And have scattered all your remnant to every wind.
\v 11 Therefore, I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh: Because My sanctuary you hast defiled, With all your detestable things, And with all yours abominations, Mine eye pitieth not, and I also spare not. Do not even I also diminish?
\v 12 Your third part — by pestilence they die, And by famine are consumed in your middle, And the third part, by sword they fall round about you, And the third part, to every wind I scatter, And a sword I draw out after them.
\v 13 And completed had been Mine anger, And I have caused My fury to rest on them, And I have been comforted, And they have known that I, Yahweh, have spoken in My zeal, In My completing My fury on them.
\v 14 And I give you for a waste, And for a reproach among nations that are round about you, Before the eyes of every passer by.
\v 15 And it had been a reproach and a reviling, An instruction and an astonishment, To nations that are round about you, In My doing in you judgments, In anger and fury, and in furious reproofs, I, Yahweh, have spoken.
\v 16 In My sending the evil arrows of famine among them, That have been for destruction, That I send to destroy you, And famine I am adding upon you, And I have broken to you the staff of bread.
\v 17 And I have sent on you famine and evil beasts, And they have bereaved you, And pestilence and blood pass over on you, And a sword I do bring in against you, I, Yahweh, have spoken!'
\c 6
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 'Son of man, set your face unto mountains of Israel, and prophesy concerning them:
\v 3 And you hast said: Mountains of Israel, Hear you a word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus said the Lord Yahweh To the mountains, and to the hills, To the streams, and to the valleys, Lo, I, I am bringing in against you a sword, And I have destroyed your high places.
\v 4 And desolated have been your altars, And broken your images, And I have caused your wounded to fall before your idols,
\v 5 And put the carcases of the sons of Israel before their idols, And scattered your bones round about your altars.
\v 6 In all your dwellings the cities are laid waste, And the high places are desolate, So that waste and desolate are your altars, And broken and ceased have your idols, And cut down have been your images, And blotted out have been your works.
\v 7 And fallen had the wounded in your middle, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 8 And I have caused some to remain, In their being to you the escaped of the sword among nations, In your being scattered through lands.
\v 9 And remembered Me have your escaped among nations, Whither they have been taken captive, Because I have been broken with their heart that is going a-whoring, That had turned aside from off Me, And with their eyes they are going a-whoring after their idols, And they have been loathsome in their own faces, For the evils that they have done — all their abominations.
\v 10 And they have known that I am Yahweh, Not for nought have I spoken to do to them this evil.
\v 11 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: 'Smite with your palm, and stamp with your foot, And say: Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, Who by sword, by famine, and by pestilence do fall.
\v 12 The far-off by pestilence dieth, And the near by sword falleth, And the left and the besieged by famine dieth, And I have completed my fury upon them.
\v 13 And you have known that I am Yahweh, In their wounded being in the middle of their idols, Round about their altars, On every high hill, on all tops of mountains, And under every green tree, and under every thick oak, The place where they gave sweet fragrance to all their idols.
\v 14 And I have stretched out my hand against them, And have made the land a desolation, Even a desolation from the wilderness to Diblath, In all their dwellings, And they have known that I am Yahweh!'
\c 7
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying, 'And you, son of man, Thus said the Lord Yahweh to the ground of Israel:
\v 2 An end, come had the end on the four corners of the land.
\v 3 Now is the end unto you, And I have sent Mine anger upon you, And judged you according to your ways, And set against you all yours abominations.
\v 4 And no pity on you had Mine eye, nor do I spare, For your ways against you I do set, And yours abominations are in your middle, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 5 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Evil, a single evil, behold, it had come.
\v 6 An end had come, come had the end, It had waked for you, behold, it had come.
\v 7 Come had the morning unto you, O inhabitant of the land! Come had the time, near is a day of trouble, And not the shouting of mountains.
\v 8 Now, shortly I pour out My fury on you, And have completed Mine anger against you, And judged you according to your ways, And set against you all yours abominations.
\v 9 And not pity did Mine eye, nor do I spare, According to your ways unto you I give, And yours abominations are in your middle, And you have known that I am Yahweh the smiter.
\v 10 Lo, the day, behold, it had come, Gone forth had the morning, Blossomed had the rod, flourished the pride.
\v 11 The violence had risen to a rod of wickedness, There is none of them, nor of their multitude, Nor of their noise, nor is there wailing for them.
\v 12 Come had the time, arrived had the day, The buyer did not rejoice, And the seller did not become a mourner, For wrath is unto all its multitude.
\v 13 For the seller to the sold thing turneth not, And yet among the living is their life, For the vision is unto all its multitude, It did not turn back, And none by his iniquity did strengthen his life.
\v 14 They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole, And none is going to battle, For My wrath is unto all its multitude.
\v 15 The sword is without, And the pestilence and the famine within, He who is in a field by sword dieth, And he who is in a city, Famine and pestilence devour him.
\v 16 And escaped away have their fugitives, And they have been on the mountains As doves of the valleys, All of them make a noising — each for his iniquity.
\v 17 All the hands are feeble, and all knees go — waters.
\v 18 And they have girded on sackcloth, And covered them had trembling, And unto all faces is shame, And on all their heads — baldness.
\v 19 Their silver into out-places they cast, And their gold impurity became. Their silver and their gold is not able to deliver them, In a day of the wrath of Yahweh, Their soul they do not satisfy, And their bowels they do not fill, For the stumbling-block of their iniquity it had been.
\v 20 As to the beauty of his ornament, For excellency He set it, And the images of their abominations, Their detestable things — they made in it, Therefore I have given it to them for impurity,
\v 21 And I have given it into the hand of the strangers for a prey, And to the wicked of the land for a spoil, And they have polluted it.
\v 22 And I have turned My face from them, And they have polluted My hidden place, Yea, come into it have destroyers, and polluted it.
\v 23 Make the chain; for the land Hath been full of bloody judgments, And the city had been full of violence.
\v 24 And I have brought in the wicked of the nations, And they have possessed their houses, And I have caused to cease the excellency of the strong, And polluted have been those sanctifying them.
\v 25 Destruction had come, And they have sought peace, and there is none.
\v 26 Mischief on mischief came, and report is on report, And they have sought a vision from a prophet, And law did perish from the priest, And counsel from the elders,
\v 27 The king did become a mourner, And a prince putteth on desolation, And the hands of the people of the land are troubled, From their own way I deal with them, And with their own judgments I judge them, And they have known that I am Yahweh!'
\c 8
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth of the month, I am sitting in my house, and elders of Judah are sitting before me, and fall on me there did a hand of the Lord Yahweh,
\v 2 and I look, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire, from the appearance of His loins and downward — fire, and from His loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of copper.
\v 3 And He putteth forth a form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head, and lift me up did a spirit between the earth and the heavens, and it brought me in to Jerusalem in visions of God, unto the opening of the inner gate that is facing the north, where is the seat of the figure of jealousy that is making jealous,
\v 4 and behold, there the honour of the God of Israel, as the appearance that I saw in the valley.
\v 5 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, lift up, I pray you, yours eyes the way of the north.' And I lift up mine eyes the way of the north, and behold, on the north of the gate of the altar this figure of jealousy, at the entrance.
\v 6 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, are you seeing what they are doing? the great abominations that the house of Israel are doing here, to keep far off from My sanctuary; and again you will turn, you will see great abominations.'
\v 7 And He brought me in unto an opening of the court, and I look, and behold, a hole in the wall;
\v 8 and He said unto me, 'Son of man, dig, I pray you, through the wall;' and I dig through the wall, and behold, an opening.
\v 9 And He said to me, 'Go in, and see the evil abominations that they are doing here.'
\v 10 And I go in, and look, and behold, every form of creeping thing, and detestable beast — and all the Idols of the house of Israel — graved on the wall, all round about,
\v 11 and seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel — and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in their middle — are standing before them, and each his censer in his hand, and the abundance of the cloud of perfume is going up.
\v 12 And He said unto me, 'Hast you seen, son of man, that which elders of the house of Israel are doing in darkness, each in the inner chambers of his imagery, for they are saying, Yahweh is not seeing us, Yahweh had forsaken the land?'
\v 13 And He said unto me, 'Again you will turn, you will see great abominations that they are doing.'
\v 14 And He brought me in unto the opening of the gate of the house of Yahweh that is at the north, and behold, there the women are sitting weeping for Tammuz.
\v 15 And He said unto me, 'Hast you seen, son of man? again you will turn, you will see greater abominations than these.'
\v 16 And He brought me in unto the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and behold, at the opening of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, about twenty-five men, their backs toward the temple of Yahweh, and their faces eastward, and they are bowing themselves eastward to the sun.
\v 17 And He said unto me, 'Hast you seen, son of man? had it been a light thing to the house of Judah to do the abomination that they have done here, that they have filled the land with violence, and turn back to provoke Me to anger? and behold, they are putting forth the branch unto their nose!
\v 18 And I also deal in fury, Mine eye did not pity, nor do I spare, and they have cried in Mine ears — a loud voice — and I do not hear them.'
\c 9
\v 1 And He crieth in mine ears — a loud voice — saying, 'Drawn near have inspectors of the city, and each his destroying weapon in his hand.'
\v 2 And behold, six men are coming from the way of the upper gate, that is facing the north, and each his slaughter-weapon in his hand, and one man in their middle is clothed with linen, and a scribe's inkhorn at his loins, and they come in, and stand near the brazen altar.
\v 3 And the honour of the God of Israel had gone up from off the cherub, on which it had been, unto the threshold of the house.
\v 4 And He called unto the man who is clothed with linen, who had the scribe's inkhorn at his loins, and Yahweh said unto him, 'Pass on into the middle of the city, into the middle of Jerusalem, and you hast made a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and who are groaning for all the abominations that are done in its middle.'
\v 5 And to the others he said in mine ears, 'Pass on into the city after him, and smite; your eye did not pity, nor do you spare;
\v 6 aged, young man, and virgin, and infant, and women, you do slay — to destruction; and against any man on whom is the mark you do not go nigh, and from My sanctuary you begin.'
\v 7 And they begin among the aged men who are before the house, and He said unto them, 'Defile the house, and fill the courts with the wounded, go forth.' And they have gone forth and have smitten in the city.
\v 8 And it came to pass, as they are smiting, and I — I am left — that I fall on my face, and cry, and say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, are You destroying all the remnant of Israel, in Your pouring out Your wrath on Jerusalem?'
\v 9 And He said unto me, 'The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very very great, and the land is full of blood, and the city had been full of perverseness, for they have said: Yahweh had forsaken the land, and Yahweh is not seeing.
\v 10 And I also, Mine eye did not pity, nor do I spare; their way on their own head I have put.'
\v 11 And behold, the man clothed with linen, at whose loins is the inkhorn, is bringing back word, saying, 'I have done as You hast commanded me.'
\c 10
\v 1 And I look, and behold, on the expanse that is above the head of the cherubs, as a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne, He had been seen over them.
\v 2 And He spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said, 'Go in unto the middle of the wheel, unto the place of the cherub, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter over the city.' And he went in before mine eyes.
\v 3 And the cherubs are standing on the right side of the house, at the going in of the man, and the cloud had filled the inner court,
\v 4 and become high did the honour of Yahweh above the cherub, over the threshold of the house, and the house is filled with the cloud, and the court had been filled with the brightness of the honour of Yahweh.
\v 5 And a noise of the wings of the cherubs had been heard unto the outer court, as the voice of God — the Mighty One — in His speaking.
\v 6 And it came to pass, in His commanding the man clothed with linen, saying, 'Take fire from between the wheel, from between the cherubs,' and he went in and standeth near the wheel,
\v 7 that the one cherub putteth forth his hand from between the cherubs unto the fire that is between the cherubs, and lifteth up, and gave into the hands of him who is clothed with linen, and he receiveth, and came forth.
\v 8 And there appeareth in the cherubs the form of a hand of man under their wings,
\v 9 and I look, and behold, four wheels near the cherubs, one wheel near the one cherub, and another wheel near the other cherub, and the appearance of the wheels is as the colour of a beryl stone.
\v 10 As to their appearances, one likeness is to them four, as it were the wheel in the middle of the wheel.
\v 11 In their going, on their four sides they go; they turn not round in their going, for to the place where the head turneth, after it they go, they turn not round in their going.
\v 12 And all their flesh, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, are full of eyes round about; to them four are their wheels.
\v 13 To the wheels — to them is one calling in mine ears, 'O wheel!'
\v 14 And four faces are to each; the face of the one is the face of the cherub, and the face of the second the face of man, and of the third the face of a lion, and of the fourth the face of an eagle.
\v 15 And the cherubs are lifted up, it is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
\v 16 And in the going of the cherubs, the wheels go beside them; and in the cherubs lifting up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels turn not round, even they, from being beside them.
\v 17 In their standing they stand, and in their exaltation they are exalted with them: for the living spirit is in them.
\v 18 And go forth did the honour of Yahweh from off the threshold of the house, and standeth over the cherubs,
\v 19 and the cherubs lift up their wings, and are lifted up from the earth before mine eyes; in their going forth, the wheels also are over-against them, and he standeth at the opening of the east gate of the house of Yahweh, and the honour of the God of Israel is over them from above.
\v 20 It is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I know that they are cherubs.
\v 21 Four faces are to each, and four wings to each, and the likeness of the hands of man is under their wings.
\v 22 As to the likeness of their faces, they are the faces that I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; each straight forward they go.
\c 11
\v 1 And lift me up did a spirit, and it brought me in unto the east gate of the house of Yahweh, that is facing the east, and behold, at the opening of the gate twenty and five men, and I see in their middle Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, heads of the people.
\v 2 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, these are the men who are devising iniquity, and who are giving evil counsel in this city;
\v 3 who are saying, It is not near — to build houses, it is the pot, and we the flesh.
\v 4 Therefore prophesy concerning them, prophesy, son of man.'
\v 5 And fall upon me did the Spirit of Yahweh, and He said unto me, 'Say: Thus said Yahweh: Rightly you have said, O house of Israel, And the steps of your spirit I have known.
\v 6 Ye multiplied your wounded in this city, And filled its out-places with the wounded.
\v 7 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Your wounded whom you placed in its middle, They are the flesh, and it is the pot, And you he had brought out from its middle.
\v 8 A sword you have feared, And a sword I bring in against you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 9 And I have brought you out of its middle, And given you into the hand of strangers, And I have done among you judgments.
\v 10 By the sword you do fall, On the border of Israel I do judge you, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 11 It is not to you for a pot, Nor are you in its middle for flesh, At the border of Israel I do judge you.
\v 12 And you have known that I am Yahweh, For in My statutes you have not walked, And My Judgments you have not done, And according to the judgments of the nations Who are round about you — you have done!'
\v 13 And it came to pass, at my prophesying, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah is dying, and I fall on my face, and cry — a loud voice — and say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, an end You are making of the remnant of Israel.'
\v 14 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 15 Son of man, your brethren, your brethren, men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel — all of it, are they to whom inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Keep far off from Yahweh;
\v 16 it is ours, the land had been given for an inheritance; therefore say: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because I put them afar off among nations, And because I scattered them through lands, I also am to them for a little sanctuary, In lands where they have gone in.
\v 17 Therefore say: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: And I have assembled you from the peoples, And I have gathered you from the lands, Into which you have been scattered, And I have given to you the ground of Israel.
\v 18 And they have gone in thither. And turned aside all its detestable things, And all its abominations — out of it.
\v 19 And I have given to them one heart, And a new spirit I do give in your middle, And I have turned the heart of stone out of their flesh, And I have given to them a heart of flesh.
\v 20 So that in My statutes they walk, And My judgments they keep, and have done them, And they have been to me for a people, And I am to them for God.
\v 21 As to those whose heart is going unto the heart Of their detestable and their abominable things, Their way on their head I have put, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 22 And the cherubs lift up their wings, and the wheels are over-against them, and the honour of the God of Israel is over them above.
\v 23 And the honour of Yahweh went up from off the middle of the city, and standeth on the mountain, that is on the east of the city.
\v 24 And a spirit had lifted me up, and brought me in to Chaldea, unto the Removed, in a vision, by the Spirit of God, and go up from off me did the vision that I have seen;
\v 25 and I speak unto the Removed all the matters of Yahweh that He had showed me.
\c 12
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, in the middle of the rebellious house you are dwelling, that have eyes to see, and they have not seen; ears they have to hear, and they have not heard; for a rebellious house are they.
\v 3 And you, son of man, make to you vessels of removal, and remove by day before their eyes, and you hast removed from your place unto another place before their eyes, it may be they consider, for a rebellious house they are.
\v 4 And you hast brought forth your vessels as vessels of removal by day before their eyes, and you, you will go forth at even before their eyes, as the goings forth of a removal.
\v 5 Before their eyes dig for you through the wall, and you hast brought forth by it.
\v 6 Before their eyes on the shoulder you will bear, in the darkness you will bring forth, your face you will cover, and you will not see the earth, for a type I have given you to the house of Israel.'
\v 7 And I do so, as I have been commanded; my vessels I have brought forth as vessels of removal by day, and at even I have dug for me through the wall with the hand; in the darkness I have brought forth, on the shoulder I have borne away, before their eyes.
\v 8 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, in the morning, saying,
\v 9 Son of man, have they not said unto you — the house of Israel — the rebellious house — What are you doing?
\v 10 say unto them, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: 'The prince is this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel who are in their middle.
\v 11 Say: I am your type; as I have done so it is done to them, into a removal, into a captivity, they do go.
\v 12 As to the prince who is in their middle, on the shoulder he beareth in the darkness, and he went forth, through the wall they dig to bring forth by it, his face he covereth, that he may not look on the very surface of the land.
\v 13 And I have spread My net for him, and he had been caught in My snare, and I have brought him in to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, and it he did not see — and there did he die.
\v 14 'And all who are round about him to help him, and all his bands, I do scatter to every wind, and a sword I draw out after them.
\v 15 And they have known that I am Yahweh, in My scattering them among nations, and I have spread them through lands;
\v 16 and I have left of them, a few in number, from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, so that they recount all their abominations among the nations where they have come, and they have known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 17 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 18 'Son of man, your bread in haste you will eat, and your water with trembling and with fear you will drink;
\v 19 and you hast said unto the people of the land, Thus said the Lord Yahweh concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, concerning the land of Israel: Their bread with fear they do eat, and their water with astonishment drink, because its land is desolate, because of its fulness, because of the violence of all who are dwelling in it.
\v 20 And the cities that are inhabited are laid waste, and the land is a desolation, and you have known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 21 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 22 Son of man, what is this simile to you, concerning the land of Israel, saying, Prolonged are the days, and perished had every vision?
\v 23 therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: I have caused this simile to cease, And they use it not as a simile again in Israel, But speak to them: Drawn near have the days, And spoken had every vision.
\v 24 For there is no more any vain vision, and flattering divination, In the middle of the house of Israel.
\v 25 For I am Yahweh, I speak, The word that I speak — it is done, It is not prolonged any more, For, in your days, O rebellious house, I speak a word, and I have done it, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 26 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 27 Son of man, behold, the house of Israel are saying, The vision that he is seeing is for many days, and of times far off he is prophesying,
\v 28 therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: None of my words are prolonged any more, When I speak a word — it is done, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 13
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'Son of man, prophesy concerning the prophets of Israel who are prophesying, and you hast said to those prophesying from their own heart: Hear you a word of Yahweh:
\v 3 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Woe unto the prophets who are foolish, Who are going after their own spirit, And they have seen nothing.
\v 4 As foxes in the wastes, Your prophets, O Israel, have been.
\v 5 Ye have not gone up into breaches, Nor do you make a fence for the house of Israel, To stand in battle in a day of Yahweh.
\v 6 They have seen vanity, and lying divination, Who are saying: An affirmation of Yahweh, And Yahweh had not sent them, And they have hoped to establish a word.
\v 7 A vain vision have you not seen, And a lying divination spoken, When you say: An affirmation of Yahweh, And I have not spoken?
\v 8 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because you have spoken vanity, and seen a lie, Therefore, behold, I am against you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 9 And My hand had been on the prophets, Who are seeing vanity, and who are divining a lie, In the assembly of My people they are not, And in the writing of the house of Israel they are not written, And unto the ground of Israel they come not, And you have known that I am the Lord Yahweh.
\v 10 Because, even because, they did cause My people to err, Saying, Peace! and there is no peace, And that one is building a wall, And behold, they are daubing it with chalk.
\v 11 Say to those daubing with chalk — It falleth, There had been an overflowing shower, And you, O hailstones, do fall, And a tempestuous wind did rend,
\v 12 And behold, fallen had the wall! Doth not one say unto you, Where is the daubing that you daubed?
\v 13 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: I have rent with a tempestuous wind in My fury, And an overflowing shower is in Mine anger, And hailstones in My fury — to consume.
\v 14 And I have broken down the wall that you daubed with chalk, And have caused it to come unto the earth, And revealed had been its foundation, And it had fallen, And you have been consumed in its middle, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 15 And I have completed My wrath on the wall, And on those daubing it with chalk, And I say to you: The wall is not, And those daubing it are not;
\v 16 The prophets of Israel who are prophesying concerning Jerusalem, And who are seeing for her a vision of peace, And there is no peace, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 17 And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who are prophesying out of their own heart, and prophesy concerning them,
\v 18 And you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Woe to those sowing pillows for all joints of the arm, And to those making the kerchiefs For the head of every stature — to hunt souls, The souls do you hunt of My people? And the souls you have do you keep alive?
\v 19 Yea, you pierce Me concerning My people, For handfuls of barley, And for pieces of bread, to put to death Souls that should not die, And to keep alive souls that should not live, By your lying to My people — hearkening to lies.
\v 20 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against your pillows, With which you are hunting there the souls of the flourishing, And I have rent them from off your arms, And have sent away the souls that you are hunting, The souls of the flourishing.
\v 21 And I have torn your kerchiefs, And delivered My people out of your hand, And they are no more in your hand for a prey, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 22 Because of paining the heart of the righteous with falsehood, And I have not pained it, And strengthening the hands of the wicked, So as not to turn back from his evil way, To keep him alive,
\v 23 Therefore, vanity you do not see, And divination you do not divine again, And I have delivered My people out of your hand, And you have known that I am Yahweh!'
\c 14
\v 1 And come in unto me do certain of the elders of Israel, and sit before me.
\v 2 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 3 'Son of man, these men have caused their idols to go up on their heart, and the stumbling-block of their iniquity they have put over-against their faces; am I inquired of at all by them?
\v 4 Therefore, speak with them, and you hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Every one of the house of Israel who caused his idols to go up unto his heart, and the stumbling-block of his iniquity setteth over-against his face, and had gone in unto the prophet — I Yahweh have given an answer to him for this, for the abundance of his idols,
\v 5 in order to catch the house of Israel by their heart, in that they have become estranged from off me by their idols — all of them.
\v 6 'Therefore say unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Turn you back, yea, turn you back from your idols, and from all your abominations turn back your faces,
\v 7 for every one of the house of Israel, and of the sojourners who did sojourn in Israel, who is separated from after Me, and did cause his idols to go up unto his heart, and the stumbling-block of his iniquity setteth over-against his face, and had come in unto the prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I, Yahweh, have answered him for Myself;
\v 8 and I have set My face against that man, and made him for a sign, and for similes, and I have cut him off from the middle of My people, and you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 9 And the prophet, when he is enticed, and had spoken a word — I, Yahweh, I have enticed that prophet, and have stretched out My hand against him, and have destroyed him from the middle of My people Israel.
\v 10 And they have borne their iniquity: as the iniquity of the inquirer, so is the iniquity of the prophet;
\v 11 so that the house of Israel do not wander any more from after Me, nor are defiled any more with all their transgressions, and they have been to Me for a people, and I am to them for God — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 12 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 13 Son of man, the land — when it sinneth against Me to commit a trespass, and I have stretched out My hand against it, and broken for it the staff of bread, and sent into it famine, and cut off from it man and beast — 
\v 14 and these three men have been in its middle, Noah, Daniel, and Job — they by their righteousness deliver their own soul — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 If an evil beast I cause to pass through the land, and it had bereaved, and it had been a desolation, without any passing through because of the beast — 
\v 16 these three men in its middle: I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh — neither sons nor daughters do they deliver; they alone are delivered, and the land is a desolation.
\v 17 Or — a sword I bring in against that land, and I have said: Sword, you will pass over through the land, and I have cut off from it man and beast — 
\v 18 and these three men in its middle: I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh — they deliver not sons and daughters, for they alone are delivered.
\v 19 Or — pestilence I send unto that land, and I have poured out My fury against it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast — 
\v 20 and Noah, Daniel, and Job, in its middle: I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh — neither son nor daughter do they deliver; they, by their righteousness, deliver their own soul.
\v 21 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: Although My four sore judgments — sword, and famine, and wild beast, and pestilence — I have sent unto Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and beast,
\v 22 yet, behold, there had been left in it an escape, who are brought forth, sons and daughters, behold, they are coming forth unto you, and you have seen their way, and their doings, and have been comforted concerning the evil that I have brought in against Jerusalem, all that which I have brought in against it.
\v 23 And they have comforted you, for you see their way and their doings, and you have known that not for nought have I done all that which I have done in her — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\c 15
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 'Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The vine-branch that had been, Among trees of the forest?
\v 3 Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a pin to hang any vessel on it?
\v 4 Lo, to the fire it had been given for fuel, Its two ends had the fire eaten, And its middle had been scorched! Is it profitable for work?
\v 5 Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much less, when fire had eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it been used yet for work?
\v 6 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: As the vine-tree among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 7 And I have set My face against them, From the fire they have gone forth, And the fire did consume them, And you have known that I am Yahweh, In My setting My face against them.
\v 8 And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 16
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, and you hast said:
\v 3 Thus said the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem: Your birth and your nativity Are of the land of the Canaanite, Your father the Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.
\v 4 As to your nativity, in the day you wast born, You — your navel had not been cut, And in water you wast not washed for ease, And you hast not been salted at all, And you hast not been swaddled at all.
\v 5 No eye had had pity on you, to do to you any of these, To have compassion on you, And you are cast on the face of the field, With loathing of your person. In the day you hast been born — you!
\v 6 And I do pass over by you, And I see you trodden down in your blood, And I say to you in your blood, Live, And I say to you in your blood, Live.
\v 7 A myriad — as the shoot of the field I have made you, And you are multiplied, and are great, And comest in with an excellent adornment, Breasts have been formed, and your hair had grown — And you, naked and bare!
\v 8 And I pass over by you, and I see you, And behold, your time is a time of loves, And I spread My skirt over you, And I cover your nakedness, And I swear to you, and come in to a covenant with you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, And you will become Mine.
\v 9 And I do wash you with water, And I wash away your blood from off you, And I anoint you with perfume.
\v 10 And I clothe you with embroidery, And I shoe you with badger's skin, And I gird you with fine linen, And I cover you with figured silk.
\v 11 And I adorn you with adornments, And I give bracelets for your hands, And a chain for your neck.
\v 12 And I give a ring for your nose, And rings for yours ears, And a crown of beauty on your head.
\v 13 And you will put on gold and silver, And your clothing is fine linen, And figured silk and embroidery, Fine flour, and honey, and oil you hast eaten, And you are very very beautiful, And will go prosperously to the kingdom.
\v 14 And go forth did your name among nations, Because of your beauty — for it is complete, In My honour that I have set upon you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 And you will trust in your beauty, And goest a-whoring because of your renown, And will pour out your whoredoms On every passer by — to him it is.
\v 16 And you will take of your garments, And will make to you spotted high-places, And will go a-whoring upon them, They are not coming in — nor shall it be!
\v 17 And you will take your beauteous vessels Of My gold and My silver that I gave to you, And will make to you images of a male, And will go a-whoring with them,
\v 18 And will take the garments of your embroidery, And you will cover them, And My oil and My perfume you hast set before them.
\v 19 And My bread, that I gave to you, Fine flour, and oil, and honey, that I caused you to eat. You hast even set it before them, For a sweet fragrance — thus it is, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 20 And you will take your sons and your daughters Whom you hast born to Me, And will sacrifice them to them for food. Is it a little thing because of your whoredoms,
\v 21 That you will slaughter My sons, And will give them up in causing them to pass over to them?
\v 22 And with all yours abominations and your whoredoms, You hast not remembered the days of your youth, When you wast naked and bare, Trodden down in your blood you wast!
\v 23 And it came to pass, after all your wickedness, (Woe, woe, to you — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh),
\v 24 That you will build to you an arch, And will make to you a high place in every broad place.
\v 25 At every head of the way you hast built your high place, And you will make your beauty abominable, And will open wide your feet to every passer by, And will multiply your whoredoms,
\v 26 And will go a-whoring unto sons of Egypt, Your neighbours — great of appetite! And you will multiply your whoredoms, To provoke Me to anger.
\v 27 And behold, I have stretched out My hand against you, And I diminish your portion, And give you to the desire of those hating you, The daughters of the Philistines, Who are ashamed of your wicked way.
\v 28 And you goest a-whoring unto sons of Asshur, Without your being satisfied, And you will go a-whoring with them, And also — you hast not been satisfied.
\v 29 And you will multiply your whoredoms On the land of Canaan — toward Chaldea, And even with this you hast not been satisfied.
\v 30 How weak is your heart, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, In your doing all these, The work of a domineering whorish woman.
\v 31 In your building yours arch at the head of every way, Your high place you hast made in every broad place, And — hast not been as a whore deriding a gift.
\v 32 The wife who committeth adultery — Under her husband — did receive strangers.
\v 33 To all whores they give a gift, And — you hast given your gifts to all your lovers, And will bribe them to come in unto you, From round about — in your whoredoms.
\v 34 And the contrary is in you from women in your whoredoms, That after you none did go a-whoring; And in your giving a gift, And a gift had not been given to you; And you are become contrary.
\v 35 Therefore, O whore, hear a word of Yahweh,
\v 36 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your brass being poured forth, And your nakedness is revealed in your whoredoms near your lovers, And near all the idols of your abominations, And according to the blood of your sons, Whom you hast given to them;
\v 37 Therefore, behold, I am assembling all your lovers, To whom you hast been sweet, And all whom you hast loved, Besides all whom you hast hated; And I have assembled them by you round about, And have revealed your nakedness to them, And they have seen all your nakedness.
\v 38 And I have judged you — judgments of adulteresses, And of women shedding blood, And have given you blood, fury, and jealousy.
\v 39 And I have given you into their hand, And they have thrown down yours arch, And they have broken down your high places, And they have stript you of your garments, And they have taken your beauteous vessels, And they have left you naked and bare.
\v 40 And have caused an assembly to come up against you, And stoned you with stones, And thrust you through with their swords,
\v 41 And burnt your houses with fire, And done in you judgments before the eyes of many women, And I have caused you to cease from going a-whoring, And also a gift you givest no more.
\v 42 And I have caused My fury against you to rest, And My jealousy had turned aside from you, And I have been quiet, and I am not angry any more.
\v 43 Because you hast not remembered the days of your youth, And will give trouble to Me in all these, Lo, even I also your way at first gave up, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, And I did not this thought for all yours abominations.
\v 44 Lo, every one using a simile, Doth use a simile concerning you, saying: As the mother — her daughter!
\v 45 Your mother's daughter you are, Loathing her husband and her sons, And your sisters' sister you are, Who loathed their husbands and their sons, Your mother is a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\v 46 And yours elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters, Who is dwelling at your left hand, And your younger sister, who is dwelling on your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
\v 47 And — in their ways you hast not walked, And according to their abominations done, As a little thing it had been loathed, And you will more corruptly than they in all your ways.
\v 48 I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Sodom your sister had not done — she and her daughters — As you hast done — you and your daughters.
\v 49 Lo, this had been the iniquity of Sodom your sister, Arrogancy, fulness of bread, and quiet ease, Have been to her and to her daughters, And the hand of the afflicted and needy She had not strengthened.
\v 50 And they are haughty and do abomination before Me, And I turn them aside when I have seen.
\v 51 As to Samaria, as the half of your sins — she had not sinned, And you will multiply yours abominations more than they, And will justify your sisters by all your abominations that you hast done.
\v 52 You also — bear your shame, That you hast adjudged to your sisters, Because of your sins that you hast done more abominably than they, They are more righteous than you, And you, also, be ashamed and bear your shame, In your justifying your sisters.
\v 53 And I have turned back to their captivity, The captivity of Sodom and her daughters, And the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, And the captivity of your captives in their middle,
\v 54 So that you will bear your shame, And hast been ashamed of all that you hast done, In your comforting them.
\v 55 And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, Do turn back to their former state, And Samaria and her daughters Do turn back to their former state, And you and your daughters do turn back to your former state.
\v 56 And your sister Sodom had not been for a report in your mouth, In the day of yours arrogancy,
\v 57 Before your wickedness is revealed, As at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Aram, And of all her neighbours, the daughters of the Philistines, Who are despising you round about.
\v 58 Your devices and yours abominations, You hast borne them, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 59 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: I have dealt with you as you hast done, In that you hast despised an oath — to break covenant.
\v 60 And I — I have remembered My covenant with you, In the days of your youth, And I have established for you a covenant age-during.
\v 61 And you hast remembered your ways, And you hast been ashamed, In your receiving your sisters — Thine elder with your younger, And I have given them to you for daughters, And not by your covenant.
\v 62 And I — I have established My covenant with you, And you hast known that I am Yahweh.
\v 63 So that you will remember, And you hast been ashamed, And there is not to you any more an opening of the mouth because of your shame, In My receiving atonement for you, For all that you hast done, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 17
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'Son of man, put forth a riddle, and use a simile unto the house of Israel,
\v 3 and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: The great eagle, great-winged, long-pinioned, Full of feathers, that had diverse colours, Hath come in unto Lebanon, And it took the foliage of the cedar,
\v 4 The top of its tender twigs it had cropped, And it brought it in to the land of Canaan. In a city of merchants it had placed it.
\v 5 And it took of the seed of the land, And did put it in a field of seed, To take by many waters, In a conspicuous place it had set it.
\v 6 And it springeth up, and became a spreading vine, humble of stature, To turn its thin shoots toward itself, And its roots are under it, And it became a vine, and made boughs, And sent forth beauteous branches.
\v 7 And there is another great eagle, Great-winged, and abounding with feathers, And behold, this vine had bent its roots toward him, And its thin shoots it had sent out toward him, To water it from the furrows of its planting,
\v 8 On a good field, by many waters, it is planted, To make branches, and to bear fruit, To be for an goodly vine.
\v 9 Say: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: It prospereth — its roots did he not draw out, And its fruit cut off, and it is withered? In all the leaves of its springing it withereth, And not by great strength, and by a numerous people, To lift it up by its roots.
\v 10 And behold, the planted thing — did it prosper? When come against it did the east wind, Doth it not utterly wither? On the furrows of its springing it withereth.'
\v 11 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 12 Say, I pray you, to the rebellious house, Have you not known what these are? Say, Lo, come had the king of Babylon to Jerusalem, And he took its king, and its princes, And brought them to himself to Babylon.
\v 13 And he took of the seed of the kingdom, And made with him a covenant, And brought him in to an oath, And the mighty of the land he had taken,
\v 14 That the kingdom may be humble, That it may not lift itself up, To keep his covenant — that it may stand.
\v 15 And he rebelleth against him, To send his messengers to Egypt, To give to him horses, and much people, Doth he prosper? did he escape who is doing these things? And had he broken covenant and escaped?
\v 16 I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Doth he not — in the place of the king who is causing him to reign, Whose oath he had despised, And whose covenant he had broken, With him — in the middle of Babylon — die?
\v 17 And not with a great force, and with a numerous assembly, Doth Pharaoh maintain him in battle, By pouring out a mount, and in building a fortification, To cut off many souls.
\v 18 And he despised the oath — to break covenant, And behold, he had given his hand, And all these he had done, he escapeth not.
\v 19 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: I live — Mine oath that he had despised, And My covenant that he had broken, Have I not put it on his head?
\v 20 And I have spread out for him My snare, And he had been caught in My net, And I have brought him in to Babylon, And pleaded with him there his trespass, That he had trespassed against Me.
\v 21 And all his fugitives, with all his bands, By sword do fall, and those remaining, To every wind they are spread out, And you have known that I, Yahweh, have spoken.
\v 22 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: I have taken of the foliage of the high cedar, And I have set it, From the top of its tender shoots a tender one I crop, And I — I have planted it on a mountain high and lofty.
\v 23 In a mountain — the high place of Israel, I plant it, And it had borne boughs, and yielded fruit, And become a goodly cedar, And dwelt under it have all birds of every wing, In the shade of its thin shoots they dwell.
\v 24 And known have all trees of the field That I, Yahweh, have made low the high tree, I have set on high the low tree, I have dried up the moist tree, And I have caused the dry tree to flourish, I, Yahweh, have spoken, and have done it!'
\c 18
\v 1 'And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 What — to you, you — using this simile Concerning the ground of Israel, saying: Fathers do eat unripe fruit, And the sons' teeth are blunted?
\v 3 I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Ye have no more the use of this simile in Israel.
\v 4 Lo, all the souls are Mine, As the soul of the father, So also the soul of the son — they are Mine, The soul that is sinning — it did die.
\v 5 And a man, when he is righteous, And had done judgment and righteousness,
\v 6 On the mountains he had not eaten, And his eyes he had not lifted up Unto idols of the house of Israel, And the wife of his neighbour defiled not, And to a separated woman came not near,
\v 7 A man — he did not oppress, His pledge to the debtor he did return, Plunder he did not take away, His bread to the hungry he did give, And the naked did cover with a garment,
\v 8 In usury he did not give, and increase took not, From perversity he turneth back his hand, True judgment he did between man and man.
\v 9 In My statutes he did walk, And My judgments he had kept — to deal truly, Righteous is he, he surely lived, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 10 And — he had begotten a son, A burglar — a shedder of blood, And he had made a brother of one of these,
\v 11 And he all those had not done, For even on the mountains he had eaten, And the wife of his neighbour he had defiled,
\v 12 The afflicted and needy he had oppressed, Plunder he had taken violently away, A pledge he did not return, And unto the idols he had lifted up his eyes, Abomination he had done!
\v 13 In usury he had given, and increase taken, And he lived: he did not live, All these abominations he had done, He did surely die, his blood is on him.
\v 14 And — behold, he had begotten a son, And he saw all the sins of his father, That he had done, and he feareth, And did not do like them,
\v 15 On the mountains he had not eaten, And his eyes he had not lifted up Unto idols of the house of Israel, The wife of his neighbour he had not defiled,
\v 16 A man — he had not oppressed, A pledge he had not bound, And plunder he had not taken away, His bread to the hungry he had given, And the naked he covered with a garment,
\v 17 From the afflicted he had turned back his hand, Usury and increase he had not taken, My judgments he had done, In My statutes he had walked, He did not die for the iniquity of his father, He did surely live.
\v 18 His father — because he used oppression, Did violently Plunder a brother, And that which is not good did in the middle of his people, And behold, he is dying in his iniquity.
\v 19 And you have said, Wherefore had not the son, Borne of the iniquity of the father? And — the son judgment and righteousness had done, All My statutes he had kept, And he doeth them, he surely lived.
\v 20 The soul that did sin — it did die. A son did not bear of the iniquity of the father, And a father did not bear of the iniquity of the son, The righteousness of the righteous is on him, And the wickedness of the wicked is on him.
\v 21 And the wicked — when he turneth back From all his sins that he had done, And he had kept all My statutes, And had done judgment and righteousness, He did surely live, he did not die.
\v 22 All his transgressions that he had done Are not remembered to him, In his righteousness that he had done he lived.
\v 23 Do I at all desire the death of the wicked? An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Is it not in his turning back from his way — And he had lived?
\v 24 And in the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness, And he had done perversity, According to all the abominations That the wicked had done, he did — thus he lived, All his righteousnesses that he had done are not remembered, For his trespass that he had trespassed, And for his sin that he had sinned, For them he did die.
\v 25 And you have said, Not pondered is the way of the Lord. Hear, I pray you, O house of Israel, My way — is it not pondered? Are not your ways unpondered?
\v 26 In the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness, And he had done perversity, And he is dying by them, for his perversity That he had done he dieth.
\v 27 And in the turning back of the wicked From his wickedness that he had done, And he did judgment and righteousness, He his soul did keep alive.
\v 28 And he saw and turneth back, From all his transgressions that he had done, He did surely live, he did not die,
\v 29 And the house of Israel have said, Not pondered is the way of the Lord, My ways — are they not pondered? O house of Israel — are not your ways unpondered?
\v 30 Therefore, each according to his ways I judge you, O house of Israel? An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Turn you back, yea, turn yourselves back, From all your transgressions, And iniquity is not to you for a stumbling-block,
\v 31 Cast from off you all your transgressions, By which you have transgressed, And make to you a new heart, and a new spirit, And why do you die, O house of Israel?
\v 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, And turn you back and live!
\c 19
\v 1 And you, lift up a lamentation unto princes of Israel,
\v 2 and you hast said: What is your mother? — a lioness, Among lions she had crouched down, In the middle of young lions she had multiplied her whelps.
\v 3 And she brought up one of her whelps, A young lion it had been, And it learneth to tear prey, man it had devoured.
\v 4 And hear of it do nations, In their pit it had been caught, And they bring it in with chains unto the land of Egypt.
\v 5 And she saw, that stayed — perished had her hope, And she took one of her whelps, A young lion she had made it.
\v 6 And it went up and down in the middle of lions, A young lion it had been, And it learneth to tear prey, man it had devoured.
\v 7 And it knoweth his forsaken habitations, And their cities it had laid waste, And desolate is the land and its fulness, Because of the voice of his roaring.
\v 8 And set against it do nations Round about from the provinces. And they spread out for it their net, In their pit it had been caught.
\v 9 And they put it in prison — in chains, And they bring it unto the king of Babylon, They bring it in unto bulwarks, So that its voice is not heard any more On mountains of Israel.
\v 10 Your mother is as a vine in your blood by waters planted, Fruitful and full of boughs it had been, Because of many waters.
\v 11 And it had strong rods for sceptres of rulers, And high is its stature above thick branches, And it appeareth in its height In the multitude of its thin shoots.
\v 12 And it is plucked up in fury, To the earth it had been cast, And the east wind had dried up its fruit, Broken and withered had been the rod of its strength, Fire had consumed it.
\v 13 And now — it is planted in a wilderness, In a land dry and thirsty.
\v 14 And go forth did fire from a rod of its boughs, Its fruit it had devoured, And it had no rod of strength — a sceptre to rule, Lamentation it is — and it is for a lamentation!'
\c 20
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the seventh year, in the fifth month, in the tenth of the month, come in have certain of the elders of Israel to seek Yahweh, and they sit before me;
\v 2 and there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 3 Son of man, speak with the elders of Israel, and you hast said unto them, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: To seek Me are you coming in? I live — I am not sought by you — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 4 Dost you judge them? Dost you judge, son of man? The abominations of their fathers cause them to know,
\v 5 and you hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In the day of My fixing on Israel, I lift up My hand, To the seed of the house of Jacob, And am known to them in the land of Egypt, And I lift up My hand to them, Saying, I am Yahweh your God.
\v 6 In that day I did lift up My hand to them, To bring them forth from the land of Egypt, Unto a land that I spied out for them, Flowing with milk and honey, A beauty it is to all the lands,
\v 7 And I say unto them, Let each cast away the detestable things of his eyes, And with the idols of Egypt be not defiled, I am Yahweh your God.
\v 8 And — they rebel against Me, And have not been willing to hearken to Me, Each, the detestable things of their eyes, They have not cast away, And the idols of Egypt have not forsaken, And I say — to pour out My fury on them, To complete Mine anger against them, In the middle of the land of Egypt.
\v 9 And I do it for My name's sake, Not to pollute it before the eyes of the nations, In whose middle they are, Before whose eyes I became known to them, To bring them out from the land of Egypt.
\v 10 And I bring them out of the land of Egypt, And I bring them in unto the wilderness,
\v 11 And I give to them My statutes, And my judgments I caused them to know, Which the man who did — lived by them.
\v 12 And also My sabbaths I have given to them, To be for a sign between Me and them, To know that I am Yahweh their sanctifier.
\v 13 And — rebel against me do the house of Israel in the wilderness, In My statutes they have not walked, And My judgments they have despised, Which the man who did — lived by them. And My sabbaths they have greatly polluted, And I say to pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\v 14 And I do it for My name's sake, Not to pollute it before the eyes of the nations, Before whose eyes I brought them forth.
\v 15 And also, I, I have lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, Not to bring them in to the land that I had given, Flowing with milk and honey, A beauty it is to all the lands,
\v 16 Because against My judgments they did kick, And in My statutes they have not walked, And My sabbaths they have polluted, For after their idols their heart is going.
\v 17 And Mine eye had pity on them — against destroying them, And I have not made of them an end in the wilderness.
\v 18 And I say to their sons in the wilderness: In the statutes of your fathers you walk not, And their judgments you do not observe, And with their idols you are not defiled.
\v 19 I am Yahweh your God, in My statutes walk, And My judgments observe, and do them,
\v 20 And My sabbaths sanctify, And they have been for a sign between Me and you, To know that I, Yahweh, am your God.
\v 21 And — the sons rebel against Me, In My statutes they have not walked, And My judgments they have not observed — to do them, Which the man who did — lived by them. My sabbaths they have polluted, And I say to pour out My fury upon them, To complete Mine anger against them in the wilderness.
\v 22 And I have turned back My hand, And I do it for My name's sake, Not to pollute it before the eyes of the nations, Before whose eyes I brought them out.
\v 23 I also, I have lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, To scatter them among nations, And to spread them through lands.
\v 24 Because My judgments they have not done, And My statutes they have despised, And My sabbaths they have polluted, And after idols of their fathers have their eyes been.
\v 25 And I also, I have given to them statutes not good, And judgments by which they do not live.
\v 26 And I defile them by their own gifts, By causing to pass away every opener of a womb, So that I make them desolate, So that they know that I am Yahweh.
\v 27 Therefore, speak unto the house of Israel, son of man, and you hast said unto them, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Still in this have your fathers reviled Me, In their committing against Me a trespass.
\v 28 And I bring them in unto the land, That I did lift up My hand to give to them, And they see every high hill, and every thick tree, And they sacrifice there their sacrifices, And give there the provocation of their offering, And make there their sweet fragrance, And they pour out there their libations.
\v 29 And I say unto them: What is the high place where you are going in? And its name is called 'high place' to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, say unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In the way of your fathers are you defiled? And after their detestable things go a-whoring?
\v 31 And in the offering of your gifts, In causing your sons to pass through fire, Ye are defiled by all your idols to this day, And I am sought by you, O house of Israel! I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, I am not sought by you.
\v 32 And that which is going up on your mind, It is not at all — in that you are saying: We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands, To serve wood and stone.
\v 33 I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Do not I, with a strong hand, And with a stretched-out arm, And with fury poured out — rule over you?
\v 34 And I have brought you forth from the peoples, And assembled you from the lands In which you have been scattered, With a strong hand and with a stretched-out arm, And with fury poured out.
\v 35 And I have brought you in unto the wilderness of the peoples, And have been judged with you there face to face.
\v 36 As I was judged with your fathers, In the wilderness of the land of Egypt, So I am judged with you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 37 And I have caused you to pass under the rod, And brought you into the bond of the covenant,
\v 38 And cleared out from you the rebels, And them transgressing against Me, From the land of their sojournings I bring them out, And unto the land of Israel they come not, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 39 And you, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Each his idols — go — serve you, And, afterwards, if you are not hearkening to me, And My holy name you do not pollute any more by your gifts, and by your idols.
\v 40 For, in My holy mountain, In the mountain of the height of Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, There serve Me do all the house of Israel, All of it, in the land — there I accept them, And there I do seek your heave-offerings, And with the first-fruit of your gifts, With all your holy things.
\v 41 With sweet fragrance I do accept you, In My bringing you out from the peoples, And I have assembled you from the lands In which you have been scattered, And I have been sanctified in you Before the eyes of the nations.
\v 42 And you have known that I am Yahweh, In My bringing you to the ground of Israel, Unto the land that I did lift up My hand To give it to your fathers,
\v 43 And you have remembered there your ways, And all your doings, In which you have been defiled, And you have been loathsome in your own faces, For all your evils that you have done.
\v 44 And you have known that I am Yahweh, In My dealing with you for My name's sake, Not according to your evil ways, And according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 45 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 46 Son of man, set your face the way of Teman, and prophesy unto the south, and prophesy unto the forest of the field — the south;
\v 47 and you hast said to the forest of the south: Hear a word of Yahweh: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am kindling in you a fire, And it had devoured in you every moist tree, and every dry tree, Not quenched is the glowing flames, And burnt by it have been all faces from south to north.
\v 48 And seen have all flesh, that I, Yahweh, have kindled it — it is not quenched.'
\v 49 And I say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, They are saying of me, Is he not using similes?
\c 21
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'Son of man, set your face unto Jerusalem, and prophesy unto the holy places, and prophesy unto the ground of Israel;
\v 3 and you hast said unto the ground of Israel: Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, And have brought out My sword from its scabbard, And have cut off from you righteous and wicked.
\v 4 Because that I have cut off from you righteous and wicked, Therefore go out did My sword from its scabbard, Unto all flesh, from south to north.
\v 5 And known have all flesh that I, Yahweh, Have brought out My sword from its scabbard, It did not turn back any more.
\v 6 And you, son of man, sigh with breaking of loins, yea, with bitterness you will sigh before their eyes,
\v 7 and it had come to pass, when they say unto you, For what are you sighing? that you hast said: Because of the report, for it is coming, And melted had every heart, And feeble had been all hands, And weak is every spirit, And all knees go — waters, Lo, it is coming, yea, it had been, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 8 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 9 'Son of man, prophesy, and you hast said, Thus said Yahweh, say: A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also polished.
\v 10 So as to slaughter a slaughter it is sharpened. So as to have brightness it is polished, Desire had rejoiced the sceptre of my son, It is despising every tree.
\v 11 And he gave it for polishing, For laying hold of by the hand. It is sharpened — the sword — and polished, To give it into the hand of a slayer.
\v 12 Cry and howl, son of man, For it had been among My people, It is among all the princes of Israel, Cast unto the sword have been My people. Therefore strike on your thigh,
\v 13 Because it is a trier, And what if even the sceptre it is despising? It shall not be, an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 14 And you, son of man, prophesy, And smite hand on hand, And bent is the sword a third time, The sword of the wounded! It is the sword of the wounded — the great one, That is entering the inner chamber to them.
\v 15 To melt the heart, and to multiply the ruins, By all their gates I have set the point of a sword. Ah, it is made for brightness, Wrapped up for slaughter.
\v 16 Take possession of the right, place thyself at the left, Whither your face is appointed.
\v 17 And I also, I smite My hand on my hand, And have caused My fury to rest; I, Yahweh, have spoken.'
\v 18 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 19 And you, son of man, appoint for you two ways, for the coming in of the sword of the king of Babylon; from one land they come forth, both of them, and a station prepare you, at the top of the way of the city prepare it.
\v 20 A way appoint for the coming of the sword, Unto Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, And to Judah, in Jerusalem — the fenced.
\v 21 For stood had the king of Babylon at the head of the way, At the top of the two ways, to use divination, He had moved lightly with the arrows, He had asked at the teraphim, He had looked on the liver.
\v 22 At his right had been the divination — Jerusalem, To place battering-rams, To open the mouth with slaughter, To lift up a voice with shouting, To place battering-rams against the gates, To pour out a mount, to build a fortification.
\v 23 And it had been to them as a false divination in their eyes, Who have sworn oaths to them, And he is causing iniquity to be remembered to be caught.
\v 24 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your causing your iniquity to be remembered, In your transgressions being revealed, For your sins being seen, in all your doings, Because of your being remembered, By the hand you are caught.
\v 25 And you, wounded, wicked one, Prince of Israel, whose day had come, In the time of the iniquity of the end!
\v 26 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Turn aside the mitre, and bear away the crown, This — not this — the low make high, And the high make low.
\v 27 An overturn, overturn, overturn, I make it, Also this had not been till the coming of Him, Whose is the judgment, and I have given it.
\v 28 And you, son of man, prophesy, and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh concerning the sons of Ammon, and concerning their reproach: and you hast said: A sword, a sword, open for slaughter, Polished to the utmost for brightness!
\v 29 In the seeing for you of a vain thing, In the divining for you of a lie, To put you on the necks of the wounded of the wicked, whose day had come, In the time of the iniquity of the end.
\v 30 Turn it back unto its scabbard, In the place where you wast produced, In the land of your birth I do judge you.
\v 31 And I have poured on you Mine indignation, With fire of My wrath I blow against you, And have given you into the hand of brutish men — artificers of destruction.
\v 32 To the fire you are for fuel, Your blood is in the middle of the land, You are not remembered, For I, Yahweh, have spoken!'
\c 22
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'And you, son of man, will you judge? will you judge the city of blood? then you hast caused it to know all its abominations,
\v 3 and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: The city is shedding blood in its middle, For the coming in of its time, And it had made idols on it for defilement.
\v 4 By your blood that you hast shed you hast been guilty, And by yours idols that you hast made you hast been defiled, And you causest your days to draw near, And are come in unto yours years, Therefore I have given you a reproach to nations, And a derision to all the lands.
\v 5 The near and the far-off from you scoff at you, O defiled of name — abounding in trouble.
\v 6 Lo, princes of Israel — each according to his arm Have been in you to shed blood.
\v 7 Father and mother made light of in you, To a sojourner they dealt oppressively in your middle, Fatherless and widow they oppressed in you.
\v 8 My holy things you hast despised, And My sabbaths you hast polluted.
\v 9 Men of slander have been in you to shed blood, And on the mountains they have eaten in you, Wickedness they have done in your middle.
\v 10 The nakedness of a father had one uncovered in you, The defiled of impurity they humbled in you.
\v 11 And each with the wife of his neighbour had done abomination, And each his daughter-in-law had defiled through wickedness, And each his sister, his father's daughter, had humbled in you.
\v 12 A bribe they have taken in you to shed blood, Usury and increase you hast taken, And cuttest off your neighbour by oppression, And Me you hast forgotten, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!
\v 13 And behold, I have smitten My hand, Because of your dishonest gain that you hast gained, And for your blood that had been in your middle.
\v 14 Doth your heart stand — are your hands strong, For the days that I am dealing with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.
\v 15 And I have scattered you among nations, And have spread you out among lands, And consumed your uncleanness out of you.
\v 16 And you hast been polluted in thyself Before the eyes of nations, And you hast known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 17 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying, 'Son of man,
\v 18 The house of Israel had been to Me for dross, All of them are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, In the middle of a furnace — dross had silver been,
\v 19 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your all becoming dross, Therefore, behold, I am gathering you unto the middle of Jerusalem,
\v 20 A gathering of silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, Unto the middle of a furnace — to blow on it fire, to melt it, So do I gather in Mine anger and in My fury, And I have let rest, and have melted you.
\v 21 And I have heaped you up, And blown on you in the fire of My wrath, And you have been melted in its middle.
\v 22 As the melting of silver in the middle of a furnace, So are you melted in its middle, And you have known that I, Yahweh, I have poured out My fury upon you.'
\v 23 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 24 Son of man, say to it, You are a land, It is not cleansed nor rained on in a day of indignation.
\v 25 A conspiracy of its prophets is in its middle, as a roaring lion tearing prey; The soul they have devoured, Wealth and glory they have taken, Its widows have multiplied in its middle.
\v 26 Its priests have wronged My law, And they pollute My holy things, Between holy and common they have not made separation, And between the unclean and the clean they have not made known, And from my sabbaths they have hidden their eyes, And I am pierced in their middle.
\v 27 Its princes in its middle are as wolves, Tearing prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, For the sake of gaining dishonest gain.
\v 28 And its prophets have daubed for them with chalk, Seeing a vain thing, and divining for them a lie, Saying, 'Thus said the Lord Yahweh:' And Yahweh had not spoken.
\v 29 The people of the land have used oppression, And have taken plunder violently away, And humble and needy have oppressed, And the sojourner oppressed — without judgment.
\v 30 And I seek of them a man making a fence, And standing in the breach before Me, In behalf of the land — not to destroy it, And I have not found.
\v 31 And I pour out on them mine indignation, By fire of My wrath I have consumed them, Their way on their own head I have put, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 23
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying, 'Son of man,
\v 2 Two women were daughters of one mother,
\v 3 And they go a-whoring in Egypt, In their youth they have gone a-whoring, There they have bruised their breasts, And there they have dealt with the loves of their virginity.
\v 4 And their names are Aholah the elder, And Aholibah her sister, And they are Mine, and bear sons and daughters. As to their names — Samaria is Aholah, And Jerusalem is Aholibah.
\v 5 And go a-whoring did Aholah under Me, And she doteth on her lovers, On the neighbouring Assyrians,
\v 6 Clothed with blue — governors and prefects, Desirable young men all of them, Horsemen, riding on horses,
\v 7 And she gave her whoredoms on them, The choice of the sons of Asshur, All of them — even all on whom she doted, By all their idols she had been defiled.
\v 8 And her whoredoms out of Egypt she had not forsaken, For with her they lay in her youth, And they dealt with the loves of her virginity, And they pour out their whoredoms on her.
\v 9 Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers, Into the hand of sons of Asshur on whom she doted.
\v 10 They have uncovered her nakedness, Her sons and her daughters they have taken, And her by sword they have killed, And she is a name for women, And judgments they have done with her.
\v 11 And see did her sister Aholibah, And she made her doting love more corrupt than she, And her whoredoms than the whoredoms of her sister.
\v 12 On sons of Asshur she had doted, Governors and prefects, Neighbouring ones — clothed in perfection, Horsemen, riding on horses, Desirable young men all of them.
\v 13 And I see that she had been defiled, One way is to them both.
\v 14 And she did add unto her whoredoms, And she saw graved men on the wall, Pictures of Chaldeans, graved with red lead,
\v 15 Girded with a girdle on their loins, Dyed attire spread out on their heads, The appearance of rulers — all of them, The likeness of sons of Babylon, Chaldea is the land of their birth.
\v 16 And she doteth on them at the sight of her eyes, And sent messengers to them, to Chaldea.
\v 17 And come in unto her do sons of Babylon, To the bed of loves, And they defile her with their whoredoms, And she is defiled with them, And her soul is alienated from them.
\v 18 And she revealeth her whoredoms, And she revealeth her nakedness, And alienated is My soul from off her, As alienated was My soul from off her sister.
\v 19 And she multiplieth her whoredoms, To remember the days of her youth, When she went a-whoring in the land of Egypt.
\v 20 And she doteth on their paramours, Whose flesh is the flesh of asses, And the issue of horses — their issue.
\v 21 You lookest after the wickedness of your youth, In dealing out of Egypt your loves, For the sake of the breasts of your youth.
\v 22 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am stirring up your lovers against you, From whom your soul had been alienated, And have brought them in against you from round about.
\v 23 Sons of Babylon, and of all Chaldea, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, All the sons of Asshur with them, Desirable young men, governors and prefects, All of them — rulers and proclaimed ones, Riding on horses, all of them.
\v 24 And they have come in against you, With arms, rider, and wheel, And with an assembly of peoples; Target, and shield, and helmet, They do set against you round about, And I have set before them judgment, They have judged you in their Judgments.
\v 25 And I have set My jealousy against you, And they have dealt with you in fury, Your nose and yours ears they turn aside, And your posterity by sword falleth, They, your sons and your daughters do take away, And your posterity is devoured by fire.
\v 26 And they have stripped you of your garments, And have taken your beauteous jewels.
\v 27 And I have caused your wickedness to cease from you, And your whoredoms out of the land of Egypt, And you liftest not up yours eyes unto them, And Egypt you will not remember again.
\v 28 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am giving you into a hand that you hast hated, Into a hand from which you wast alienated.
\v 29 And they have dealt with you in hatred, And they have taken all your labour, And they have left you naked and bare, And revealed had been the nakedness of your whoredoms, And the wickedness of your whoredoms.
\v 30 To do these things to you, In your going a-whoring after nations, Because you hast been defiled with their idols,
\v 31 In the way of your sister you hast walked, And I have given her cup into your hand.
\v 32 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: The cup of your sister you will drink, The deep and the wide one, (You are for laughter and for scorn,) Abundant to contain.
\v 33 With drunkenness and sorrow you are filled, A cup of astonishment and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria.
\v 34 And you hast drunk it, and hast drained it, And its earthen ware you will gnaw, And yours own breasts you pluckest off, For I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh,
\v 35 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because you hast forgotten Me, And you will cast Me behind your back, Even you also bear your wickedness and your whoredoms.'
\v 36 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Son of man, Dost you judge Aholah and Aholibah? Declare then to them their abominations.
\v 37 For they have committed adultery, And blood is in their hands, With their idols they committed adultery, And also their sons whom they bore to Me, They caused to pass over to them for food.
\v 38 Again, this they have done to Me, They defiled My sanctuary in that day, And My sabbaths they have polluted.
\v 39 And in their slaughtering their sons to their idols They also come in unto My sanctuary in that day to pollute it, And behold, thus they have done in the middle of My house,
\v 40 And also that they send to men coming from afar, Unto whom a messenger is sent, And behold, they have come in for whom you hast washed, Painted yours eyes, and put on adornment.
\v 41 And you hast sat on a couch of honour, And a table arrayed before it, And My perfume and My oil placed on it.
\v 42 And the voice of a multitude at ease is with her, And unto men of the common people are brought in Sabeans from the wilderness, And they put bracelets on their hands, And a beauteous crown on their heads.
\v 43 And I say of the worn-out one in adulteries, Now they commit her whoredoms — she also!
\v 44 And they come in unto her, As the coming in unto a whorish woman, So they have come in unto Aholah, And unto Aholibah — the wicked women.
\v 45 As to righteous men, they judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, And the judgment of women shedding blood, For they are adulteresses, And blood is in their hands.
\v 46 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: Bring up against them an assembly, And give them to trembling and to spoiling.
\v 47 And they have cast at them the stone of the assembly, And cut them with their swords, Their sons and their daughters they do slay, And their houses with fire they burn.
\v 48 And I have caused wickedness to cease from the land, And instructed have been all the women, And they do not according to your wickedness.
\v 49 And they have put your wickedness on you, And the sins of your idols you bear, And you have known that I am the Lord Yahweh!
\c 24
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, write for you the name of the day — this self-same day leaned had the king of Babylon toward Jerusalem in this self-same day — 
\v 3 and use unto the rebellious house a simile, and you hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: To set on the pot, to set it on, and also to pour into it water,
\v 4 To gather its pieces unto it, every good piece, Thigh and shoulder, the choice of the bones to fill in.
\v 5 The choice of the flock to take, And also to pile of the bones under it, Boil it thoroughly, yea, cook its bones in its middle.
\v 6 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Woe to the city of blood, A pot whose scum is in it, And its scum had not come out of it, By piece of it, by piece of it bring it out, Not fallen on it had a lot.
\v 7 For her blood in her middle had been, On a clear place of a rock she had set it, She had not poured it on the earth, To cover it over with dust.
\v 8 To cause fury to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on a clear place of a rock — not to be covered.
\v 9 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Woe to the city of blood, yea, I — I make great the pile.
\v 10 Make abundant the wood, Kindle the fire, consume the flesh, And make the compound, And let the bones be burnt.
\v 11 And cause it to stand on its coals empty, So that its brass is hot and burning, Melted had been in its middle its uncleanness, Consumed is its scum.
\v 12 With sorrows she had wearied herself, And the abundance of her scum went not out of her, In the fire is her scum.
\v 13 In yours uncleanness is wickedness, Because I have cleansed you, And you hast not been cleansed, From yours uncleanness you are not cleansed again, Till I have caused My fury to rest on you.
\v 14 I, Yahweh, had spoken, It had come, and I have done it, I do not free, nor do I spare, nor do I repent, According to your ways, and according to yours acts, they have judged you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 15 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 16 'Son of man, behold, I am taking from you the desire of yours eyes by a stroke, and you will not mourn, nor weep, nor let your tear come.
\v 17 Cease to groan, for the dead you will make no mourning, your bonnet bind on you, and your shoes you will put on your feet, and you will not cover over the upper lip, and bread of men you will not eat.'
\v 18 And I speak unto the people in the morning, and my wife dieth in the evening, and I do in the morning as I have been commanded.
\v 19 And the people say unto me, 'Dost you not declare to us what these are to us, that you are doing?'
\v 20 And I say unto them, 'A word of Yahweh had been unto me, saying:
\v 21 Say to the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am polluting My sanctuary, The excellency of your strength, The desire of your eyes, and the pitied of your soul, And your sons and your daughters whom you have left, by sword they do fall.
\v 22 And you have done as I have done, On the upper lip you are not covered, And bread of men you do not eat.
\v 23 And your bonnets are on your heads, And your shoes are on your feet, Ye do not mourn nor do you weep, And you have wasted away for your iniquities, And you have howled one unto another.
\v 24 And Ezekiel had been to you for a type, According to all that he had done you do; In its coming in — you have known that I am the Lord Yahweh.
\v 25 And you, son of man, Is it not in the day of My taking from them their strength, The joy of their beauty, the desire of their eyes, And the song of their soul, Their sons and their daughters?
\v 26 In that day come did the escaped one to you. To cause the ears to hear.
\v 27 In that day opened is your mouth with the escaped, And you speakest, and are not silent any more, And you hast been to them for a type. And they have known that I am Yahweh.'
\c 25
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'Son of man, set your face unto the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them;
\v 3 and you hast said to the sons of Ammon: Hear you a word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your saying, Aha, to My sanctuary, Because it had been polluted, And unto the ground of Israel, Because it had been desolate, And unto the house of Judah, Because they have gone into a removal:
\v 4 Therefore, behold, I am giving you to sons of the east for a possession, And they set their towers in you, And have placed in you their tabernacles. They eat your fruit, and they drink your milk,
\v 5 And I have given Rabbah for a habitation of camels, And the sons of Ammon for the crouching of a flock, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 6 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your clapping the hand, And of your stamping with the foot, And you rejoicest with all your despite in soul Against the ground of Israel,
\v 7 Therefore, behold, I — I have stretched out My hand against you, And have given you for a portion to nations, And I have cut you off from the peoples, And caused you to perish from the lands; I destroy you, and you hast known that I am Yahweh.
\v 8 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of the saying of Moab and Seir: Lo, as all the nations is the house of Judah;
\v 9 Therefore, behold, I am opening the shoulder of Moab — From the cities — from his cities — from his frontier, The beauty of the land, Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim,
\v 10 To the sons of the east, with the sons of Ammon, And I have given it for a possession, So that the sons of Ammon are not remembered among nations.
\v 11 And in Moab I do judgments, And they have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 12 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of the doings of Edom, In taking vengeance on the house of Judah, Yea, they are very guilty, And they have taken vengeance on them.
\v 13 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: I have stretched out My hand against Edom, And I have cut off from it man and beast, And given it up — a waste, from Teman even to Dedan, By sword they do fall.
\v 14 And I have given My vengeance on Edom, By the hand of My people Israel, And they have done in Edom, According to My anger, and according to My fury, And they have known My vengeance, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of the doings of the Philistines in vengeance, And they take vengeance with despite in soul, To destroy — the enmity age-during!
\v 16 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am stretching out My hand against the Philistines, And I have cut off the Cherethim, And destroyed the remnant of the haven of the sea,
\v 17 And done upon them great vengeance with furious reproofs, And they have known that I am Yahweh, In My giving out My vengeance on them!
\c 26
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the eleventh year, in the first of the month, there had been a word of Yahweh unto me, saying: 'Son of man,
\v 2 Because that Tyre had said of Jerusalem: Aha, she had been broken, the doors of the peoples, She had turned round unto me, I am filled — she had been laid waste,
\v 3 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, O Tyre, And have caused to come up against you many nations, As the sea caused its billows to come up.
\v 4 And they have destroyed the walls of Tyre, And they have broken down her towers, And I have scraped her dust from her, And made her for a clear place of a rock.
\v 5 A spreading place of nets she is in the middle of the sea, For I — I have spoken — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, And she had been for a spoil to nations.
\v 6 And her daughters who are in the field, by sword they are killed, And they have known that I am Yahweh,
\v 7 For, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am bringing in unto Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, From the north — a king of kings, With horse, and with chariot, and with horsemen, Even an assembly, and a numerous people.
\v 8 Your daughters in the field by sword he slaid, And he had made against you a fort, And had poured out against you a mount, And had raised against you a buckler.
\v 9 And a battering-ram before him he placeth against your walls, And your towers he breaketh by his weapons.
\v 10 From the abundance of his horses cover you did their dust, From the noise of horseman, and wheel, and rider, Shake do your walls, in his coming in to your gates, As the coming into a city broken-up.
\v 11 With hoofs of his horses he treadeth all yours out-places, Your people by sword he did slay, And the pillars of your strength to the earth come down.
\v 12 And they have spoiled your wealth, And they have plundered your merchandise, And they have thrown down your walls, And your desirable houses they break down, And your stones, and your wood, and your dust, In the middle of the waters they place.
\v 13 And I have caused the noise of your songs to cease, And the voice of your harps is heard no more.
\v 14 And I have given you up for a clear place of a rock, A spreading-place of nets you are, You are not built up any more, For I, Yahweh, I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 Thus said the Lord Yahweh to Tyre: Do not — from the noise of your fall, In the groaning of the wounded, In the slaying of the slaughter in your middle, The isles shake?
\v 16 And come down from off their thrones have all princes of the sea, And they have turned aside their robes, And their embroidered garments strip off, Trembling they put on, on the earth they sit, And they have trembled every moment, And they have been astonished at you,
\v 17 And have lifted up for you a lamentation, And said to you: How hast you perished, That are inhabited from the seas, The praised city, that was strong in the sea, She and her inhabitants, Who put their terror on all her inhabitants!
\v 18 Now they tremble, is it not the day of your fall? Troubled have been the isles that are in the sea, at yours outgoing.
\v 19 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: In my making you a city wasted, Like cities that have not been inhabited, In bringing up against you the deep, Then covered you have the great waters.
\v 20 And I have caused you to go down, With those going down to the pit, Unto the people of old, And I have caused you to dwell in the land, The lower parts — in wastes of old, With those going down to the pit, So that you are not inhabited, And I have given beauty in the land of the living.
\v 21 Wastes I do make you, and you are not, And you are sought, and are not found any more — to the age, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 27
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 'And you, son of man, lift up concerning Tyre a lamentation, and you hast said to Tyre:
\v 3 O dweller on the entrances of the sea, Merchant of the peoples unto many isles, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: O Tyre, you — you hast said: I am the perfection of beauty.
\v 4 In the heart of the seas are your borders, Your builders have perfected your beauty.
\v 5 Of firs of Senir they have built to you all your double-boarded ships, Of cedars of Lebanon they have taken to make a mast for you,
\v 6 Of oaks of Bashan they made yours oars, Your bench they have made of ivory, A branch of Ashurim from isles of Chittim.
\v 7 Of fine linen with embroidery from Egypt had been your sail, To be to you for an ensign, Of blue and purple from isles of Elishah had been your covering.
\v 8 Inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad have been rowers to you, Your wise men, O Tyre, have been in you, They are your pilots.
\v 9 Elders of Gebal and its wise men have been in you, Strengthening your breach; All ships of the sea and their mariners, Have been in you, to trade with your merchandise.
\v 10 Persian and Lud and Phut Have been in your forces — your men of war. Shield and helmet they hung up in you, They — they have given out yours honour.
\v 11 The sons of Arvad, and your force, Are on your walls round about, And short swordsmen in your towers have been, Their shields they have hung up on your walls round about, They — they have perfected your beauty.
\v 12 Tarshish is your merchant, Because of the abundance of all wealth, For silver, iron, tin, and lead, They have given out your remnants.
\v 13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech — they are your merchants, For persons of men, and vessels of brass, They have given out your merchandise.
\v 14 They of the house of Togarmah, For horses, and riding steeds, and mules, They have given out your remnants.
\v 15 Sons of Dedan are your merchants, Many isles are the mart of your hand, Horns of ivory and ebony they sent back your reward.
\v 16 Aram is your merchant, Because of the abundance of your works, For emerald, purple, and embroidery, And fine linen, and coral, and agate, They have given out your remnants.
\v 17 Judah and the land of Israel — they are your merchants, For wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, And honey, and oil, and balm, They have given out your merchandise.
\v 18 Damascus is your merchant, For the abundance of your works, Because of the abundance of all wealth, For wine of Helbon, and white wool.
\v 19 Vedan and Javan go about with your remnants, They have given shining iron, cassia, and cane, In your merchandise it had been.
\v 20 Dedan is your merchant, For clothes of freedom for riding.
\v 21 Arabia, and all princes of Kedar, They are the traders of your hand, For lambs, and rams, and he-goats, In these your merchants.
\v 22 Merchants of Sheba and Raamah — they are your merchants, For the chief of all spices, And for every precious stone, and gold, They have given out your remnants.
\v 23 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, merchants of Sheba, Asshur — Chilmad — are your merchants,
\v 24 They are your merchants for perfect things, For wrappings of blue, and embroidery, And for treasuries of rich apparel, With cords bound and girded, for your merchandise,
\v 25 Ships of Tarshish are your double walls of your merchandise, And you are filled and honoured greatly, In the heart of the seas.
\v 26 Into great waters have they brought you, Those rowing you, The east wind had broken you in the heart of the seas.
\v 27 Your wealth and your remnants, Your merchandise, your mariners, And your pilots, strengtheners of your breach, And the traders of your merchandise, And all your men of war, who are in you, And in all yours assembly that is in your middle, Fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your fall,
\v 28 At the voice of the cry of your pilots shake do the suburbs.
\v 29 And come down from their ships have all handling an oar, Mariners, all the pilots of the sea, on the land they stand,
\v 30 And have sounded for you with their voice, And cry bitterly, and cause dust to go up on their heads, In ashes they do roll themselves.
\v 31 And they have made for you baldness, And they have girded on sackcloth, And they have wept for you, In bitterness of soul — a bitter mourning.
\v 32 And lifted up for you have their sons a lamentation, And they have lamented over you, who is as Tyre? As the cut-off one in the middle of the sea?
\v 33 With the outgoing of your remnants from the seas, You hast filled many peoples, With the abundance of your riches, and your merchandise, You hast made rich things of earth.
\v 34 The time of your being broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, Your merchandise and all your assembly in your middle have fallen.
\v 35 All inhabitants of the isles have been astonished at you, And their kings have been sore afraid, They have been troubled in countenance.
\v 36 Merchants among the peoples have shrieked for you, Wastes you hast been, and you are not — to the age!'
\c 28
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because your heart had been high, And you will say: A god I am, The habitation of God I have inhabited, In the heart of the seas, And you are man, and not God, And you givest out your heart as the heart of God,
\v 3 Lo, you are wiser than Daniel, No hidden thing have they concealed from you.
\v 4 By your wisdom and by yours understanding You hast made for you wealth, And makest gold and silver in your treasuries.
\v 5 By the abundance of your wisdom, Through your merchandise, You hast multiplied your wealth, And high is your heart through your wealth.
\v 6 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because of your giving out your heart as the heart of God,
\v 7 Therefore, behold, I am bringing in against you strangers, The terrible of the nations, And they have drawn out their swords Against the beauty of your wisdom, And they have pierced your brightness.
\v 8 To destruction they bring you down, You diest by the deaths of the wounded, in the heart of the seas.
\v 9 Dost you really say, 'I am God,' Before him who is slaying you? And you are man, and not God, In the hand of him who is piercing you.
\v 10 The deaths of the uncircumcised you diest, By the hand of strangers, for I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 11 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 12 'Son of man, lift up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, And you hast said to him: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: You are sealing up a measurement, Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
\v 13 In Eden, the garden of God, you hast been, Every precious stone your covering, Ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, Sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle, and gold, The workmanship of your tabrets, and of your pipes, In you in the day of your being produced, have been prepared.
\v 14 You are an anointed cherub who is covering, And I have set you in the holy mount, God you hast been, In the middle of stones of fire you hast walked up and down.
\v 15 Perfect are you in your ways, From the day of your being produced, Till perversity had been found in you.
\v 16 By the abundance of your merchandise They have filled your middle with violence, And you will sin, And I thrust you from the mount of God, And I destroy you, O covering cherub, From the middle of the stones of fire.
\v 17 High had been your heart, because of your beauty, You hast corrupted your wisdom because of your brightness, On the earth I have cast you, Before kings I have set you, to look on you,
\v 18 From the abundance of your iniquity, By the perversity of your traffic, You hast polluted your sanctuaries, And I bring forth fire from your middle, It had devoured you, And I make you become ashes on the earth, Before the eyes of all beholding you.
\v 19 All knowing you among the peoples Have been astonished at you, Wastes you hast been, and you are not — to the age.'
\v 20 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 21 'Son of man, set your face unto Zidon, and prophesy concerning it;
\v 22 and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, O Zidon, And I have been honoured in your middle, And they have known that I am Yahweh, In My doing in her judgments, And I have been sanctified in her.
\v 23 And I have sent into her pestilence, And blood into her out-places, The wounded had been judged in her middle, By the sword upon her round about, And they have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 24 And there is no more to the house of Israel A pricking brier, and paining thorn, Of all round about them — despising them, And they have known that I am the Lord Yahweh.
\v 25 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In My gathering the house of Israel, Out of the peoples among whom they were scattered, I have been sanctified in them, Before the eyes of the nations, And they have dwelt on their ground, That I gave to My servant, to Jacob,
\v 26 And they have dwelt on it confidently, And builded houses, and planted vineyards, And dwelt confidently — in My doing judgments, On all those despising them round about, And they have known that I, Yahweh, am their God!'
\c 29
\v 1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth of the month, had a word of Yahweh been unto me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy concerning him, and concerning Egypt — all of it.
\v 3 Speak, and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt! The great dragon that is crouching in the middle of his floods, Who had said, My flood is my own, And I — I have made it for myself.
\v 4 And I have put hooks in your jaws, And I have caused the fish of your floods to cleave to your scales, And I have caused you to come up from the middle of your floods, And every fish of your floods to your scales did cleave.
\v 5 And I have left you in the wilderness, You and every fish of your floods, On the face of the field you will fall, You are not gathered nor assembled, To the beast of the earth and to the fowl of the heavens I have given you for food.
\v 6 And known have all inhabitants of Egypt That I am Yahweh, Because of their being a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
\v 7 In their taking hold of you by your hand, — you are crushed, And hast rent to them all the shoulder, And in their leaning on you you are broken, And hast caused all their thighs to stand.
\v 8 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am bringing in against you a sword, And have cut off from you man and beast.
\v 9 And the land of Egypt had been for a desolation and a waste, And they have known that I am Yahweh. Because he said: The flood is mine, and I made it.
\v 10 Therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your floods, And have given the land of Egypt for wastes, A waste, a desolation, from Migdol to Syene, And unto the border of Cush.
\v 11 Not pass over into it did a foot of man, Yea, the foot of beast did not pass into it, Nor is it inhabited forty years.
\v 12 And I have made the land of Egypt a desolation, In the middle of desolate lands, And its cities, in the middle of waste cities, Are a desolation forty years, And I have scattered the Egyptians among nations, And I have dispersed them through lands.
\v 13 But thus said the Lord Yahweh: At the end of forty years I gather the Egyptians Out of the peoples where they have been scattered,
\v 14 And I have turned back to the captivity of Egypt, And I have brought them back To the land of Pathros, to the land of their birth, And they have been there a low kingdom.
\v 15 Of the kingdoms it is lowest, And it lifteth not up itself any more above the nations, And I have made them few, So as not to rule among nations.
\v 16 And it is no more to the house of Israel for a confidence, Bringing iniquity to remembrance, By their turning after them, And they have known that I am the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 17 And it came to pass, in the twenty and seventh year, in the first month, in the first of the month, had a word of Yahweh been unto me, saying:
\v 18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Hath caused his force to serve a great service against Tyre, Every head is bald — every shoulder peeled, And reward he had none, nor his force, out of Tyre, For the service that he served against it.
\v 19 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh, Lo, I am giving to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon the land of Egypt, And he had taken away its store, And had taken its spoil, and taken its prey, And it had been a reward to his force.
\v 20 His wage for which he laboured I have given to him, The land of Egypt — in that they wrought for Me, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 21 In that day I cause to shoot up a horn to the house of Israel, And to you I give an opening of the mouth in their middle, And they have known that I am Yahweh!'
\c 30
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 'Son of man, prophesy, and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Howl you, ha! for the day!
\v 3 For near is a day, near is a day to Yahweh! A day of clouds, the time of nations it is.
\v 4 And come in had a sword to Egypt, And there had been great pain in Cush, In the falling of the wounded in Egypt, And they have taken its store, And broken down have been its foundations.
\v 5 Cush, and Phut, and Lud, and all the mixture, and Chub, And the sons of the land of the covenant with them by sword do fall,
\v 6 Thus said Yahweh: And — fallen have supporters of Egypt, And come down had the arrogance of her strength, From Migdol to Syene, by sword they fall in her, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 7 And they have been desolated in the middle of desolate lands, And its cities are in the middle of wasted cities.
\v 8 And they have known that I am Yahweh, In My giving fire against Egypt, And broken have been all her helpers.
\v 9 In that day go forth do messengers from before Me in ships, To trouble confident Cush, And there had been great pain among them, As the day of Egypt, for behold, it had come.
\v 10 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: I have caused the multitude of Egypt to cease, By the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
\v 11 He and his people with him — the terrible of nations, Are brought in to destroy the land, And they have drawn their swords against Egypt, And have filled the land with the wounded.
\v 12 And I have made floods a dry place, And I have sold the land into the hand of evil doers, And I have made desolate the land, And its fulness, by the hand of strangers, I, Yahweh, have spoken.
\v 13 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: And — I have destroyed idols, And caused vain things to cease from Noph, And a prince of the land of Egypt there is no more, And I give fear in the land of Egypt.
\v 14 And I have made Pathros desolate, And I have given fire against Zoan, And I have done judgments in No,
\v 15 And I have poured out My fury on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, And I have cut off the multitude of No.
\v 16 And I have given fire against Egypt, Greatly pained is Sin, and No is to be rent, And Noph had daily distresses.
\v 17 The youths of Aven and Pi-Beseth by sword do fall, And these into captivity do go.
\v 18 And in Tehaphnehes had the day been dark, In My breaking there the yokes of Egypt, And ceased in her had the excellency of her strength, She — a cloud did cover her, And her daughters into captivity do go.
\v 19 And I have done judgments in Egypt, And they have known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 20 And it came to pass, in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh of the month, had a word of Yahweh been unto me, saying: 'Son of man,
\v 21 The arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, I have broken, And behold, it had not been bound up to give healing, To put a bandage to bind it, To strengthen it — to lay hold on the sword.
\v 22 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, And I have broken his arms, The strong one and the broken one, And have caused the sword to fall out of his hand,
\v 23 And scattered the Egyptians among nations, And I have spread them through lands,
\v 24 And strengthened the arms of the king of Babylon, And I have given My sword into his hand, And I have broken the arms of Pharaoh, And he had groaned the groans of a pierced one — before him.
\v 25 And I have strengthened the arms of the king of Babylon, And the arms of Pharaoh do fall down, And they have known that I am Yahweh, In My giving My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, And he had stretched it out toward the land of Egypt.
\v 26 And I have scattered the Egyptians among nations, And I have spread them through lands, And they have known that I am Yahweh!'
\c 31
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first of the month, had a word of Yahweh been unto me, saying:
\v 2 'Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and unto his multitude: To whom hast you been like in your greatness?
\v 3 Lo, Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon, Fair in branch, and shading bough, and high in stature, And between thickets had its foliage been.
\v 4 Waters have made it great, The deep had exalted him with its flowings, Going round about its planting, And its conduits it had sent forth unto all trees of the field.
\v 5 Therefore higher had been his stature than all trees of the field, And multiplied are his boughs, and long are his branches, Because of many waters in his shooting forth,
\v 6 In his boughs made a nest had every fowl of the heavens, And under his branches brought forth had every beast of the field, And in his shade dwell do all great nations.
\v 7 And he is fair in his greatness, In the length of his thin shoots, For his root had been by great waters.
\v 8 Cedars have not hid him in the garden of God, Firs have not been like unto his boughs, And chesnut-trees have not been as his branches, No tree in the garden of God had been like unto him in his beauty,
\v 9 Fair I have made him in the multitude of his thin shoots, And envy him do all trees of Eden that are in the garden of God.
\v 10 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because that you hast been high in stature, And he yieldeth his foliage between thickets, And high is his heart in his haughtiness,
\v 11 I give him into the hand of a god of nations, He dealeth sorely with him, In his wickedness I have cast him out.
\v 12 And cut him off do strangers, The terrible of nations, and they leave him, On the mountains and in all valleys have his thin shoots fallen, And broken are his boughs at all streams of the land, And go down from his shade do all peoples of the land, and they leave him.
\v 13 On his ruin dwell do all fowls of the heavens, And on his boughs have been all the beasts of the field,
\v 14 In order that none of the trees of the waters May become haughty because of their stature, Nor give their foliage between thickets, Nor any drinking waters stand up unto them in their haughtiness, For all of them are given up to death, Unto the earth — the lower part, In the middle of the sons of men, Unto those going down to the pit.
\v 15 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In the day of his going down to sheol I have caused mourning, I have covered for him the deep, and diminish its flowings, And restrained are many waters, And I make Lebanon black for him, And all trees of the field have been covered for him.
\v 16 From the sound of his fall I have caused nations to shake, In My causing him to go down to sheol, With those going down to the pit, And comforted in the earth — the lower part, are all trees of Eden, The choice and the good of Lebanon, All drinking waters.
\v 17 Also they with him have gone down to sheol, Unto the pierced of the sword, And — his arm — they dwelt in his shade in the middle of nations.
\v 18 Unto whom hast you been thus like, In honour and in greatness among the trees of Eden, And you hast been brought down with the trees of Eden, Unto the earth — the lower part, In the middle of the uncircumcised you liest, With the pierced of the sword? It is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 32
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first of the month, had a word of Yahweh been unto me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and you hast said unto him: A young lion of nations you hast been like, And you are as a dragon in the seas, And you comest forth with your flowings, And will trouble the waters with your feet, And you will foul their flowings.
\v 3 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: And — I have spread out for you My net, With an assembly of many peoples, And they have brought you up in My net.
\v 4 And I have left you in the land, On the face of the field I do cast you out, And have caused to dwell upon you every fowl of the heavens, And have satisfied out of you the beasts of the whole earth.
\v 5 And I have put your flesh on the mountains, And filled the valleys with your hugeness,
\v 6 And watered the land with your flowing, From your blood — unto the mountains, And streams are filled from you.
\v 7 And in quenching you I have covered the heavens, And have made black their stars, The sun with a cloud I do cover, And the moon caused not its light to shine.
\v 8 All luminaries of light in the heavens, I make black over you, And I have given darkness over your land, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh,
\v 9 And I have vexed the heart of many peoples, In My bringing in your destruction among nations, Unto lands that you hast not known.
\v 10 And I have made many peoples astonished at you, And their kings are afraid at you with trembling, In My brandishing My sword before their faces, And they have trembled every moment, Each for his life — in the day of your fall.
\v 11 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: A sword of the king of Babylon entereth you,
\v 12 By swords of the mighty I cause your multitude to fall, The terrible of nations — all of them, And they have spoiled the excellency of Egypt, And destroyed had been all her multitude.
\v 13 And I have destroyed all her beasts, From beside many waters, And trouble them not did a foot of man any more, Yea, the hoofs of beasts trouble them not.
\v 14 Then do I cause their waters to sink, And their rivers as oil I cause to go, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 In My making the land of Egypt a desolation, And desolated had been the land of its fulness, In My smiting all the inhabitants in it, And they have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 16 A lamentation it is, and they have lamented her, Daughters of the nations do lament her, For Egypt, and for all her multitude, they lament her, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 17 And it came to pass, in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth of the month, had a word of Yahweh been unto me, saying,
\v 18 Son of man, Wail for the multitude of Egypt, And cause it to go down, It — and the daughters of honourable nations, Unto the earth — the lower parts, With those going down to the pit.
\v 19 Than whom hast you been more pleasant? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.
\v 20 In the middle of the pierced of the sword they fall, To the sword she had been given, They drew her out, and all her multitude.
\v 21 Speak to him do the gods of the mighty out of the middle of sheol, With his helpers — they have gone down, They have lain with the uncircumcised, The pierced of the sword.
\v 22 There is Asshur, and all her assembly, Round about him are his graves, All of them are wounded, who are falling by sword,
\v 23 Whose graves are appointed in the sides of the pit, And her assembly is round about her grave, All of them wounded, falling by sword, Because they gave terror in the land of the living.
\v 24 There is Elam, and all her multitude, Round about is her grave, All of them wounded, who are falling by sword, Who have gone down uncircumcised unto the earth — the lower parts, Because they gave their terror in the land of the living, And they bear their shame with those going down to the pit.
\v 25 In the middle of the wounded they have appointed a bed for her with all her multitude, Round about him are her graves, All of them uncircumcised, pierced of the sword, For their terror was given in the land of the living, And they bear their shame with those going down to the pit, In the middle of the pierced he had been put.
\v 26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude, Round about him are her graves, All of them uncircumcised, pierced of the sword, For they gave their terror in the land of the living,
\v 27 And they lie not with the mighty, Who are falling of the uncircumcised, Who have gone down to sheol with their weapons of war, And they put their swords under their heads, And their iniquities are on their bones, For the terror of the mighty is in the land of the living.
\v 28 And you, in the middle of the uncircumcised are broken, And will lie with the pierced of the sword.
\v 29 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, Who have been given up in their might, With the pierced of the sword, They with the uncircumcised do lie, And with those going down to the pit.
\v 30 There are princes of the north, All of them, and every Zidonian, Who have gone down with the pierced in their terror, Of their might they are ashamed, And they lie uncircumcised with the pierced of the sword, And they bear their shame with those going down to the pit.
\v 31 Then did Pharaoh see, And he had been comforted for all his multitude, The pierced of the sword — Pharaoh and all his force, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 32 For I have given his terror in the land of the living, And he had been laid down in the middle of the uncircumcised, With the pierced of the sword — Pharaoh, and all his multitude, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 33
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, speak unto the sons of your people, and you hast said unto them: A land — when I bring in against it a sword, And the people of the land have taken one man out of their borders, And made him to them for a watchman.
\v 3 And he had seen the sword coming against the land, And had blown with a trumpet, and had warned the people,
\v 4 And the hearer had heard the voice of the trumpet, and he had not taken warning, And come in did the sword, and took him away, His blood is on his head.
\v 5 The voice of the trumpet he heard, And he had not taken warning, his blood is on him, And he who took warning his soul had delivered.
\v 6 And the watchman, when he saw the sword coming in, And he had not blown with a trumpet, And the people had not been warned, And come in did a sword, And took away of them — a soul, He in his iniquity is taken away, And his blood from the hand of the watchman I require.
\v 7 And you, son of man, A watchman I gave you to the house of Israel, And you hast heard from My mouth a word, And you hast warned them from Me.
\v 8 In My saying to the wicked, O wicked one — you will surely die, And you hast not spoken to warn the wicked from his way, He — the wicked — in his iniquity did die, And his blood from your hand I require.
\v 9 And you, when you hast warned the wicked of his way, to turn back from it, And he had not turned back from his way, He in his iniquity did die, And you your soul hast delivered.
\v 10 And you, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Rightly you have spoken, saying: Surely our transgressions and our sins are on us, And in them we are wasting away, How, then, do we live?
\v 11 Say unto them, I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, I delight not in the death of the wicked, But — in the turning of the wicked from his way, And he had lived, Turn back, turn back, from your evil ways, Yea, why do you die, O house of Israel?
\v 12 And you, son of man, say unto the sons of your people: The righteousness of the righteous did not deliver him in the day of his transgression, And the wickedness of the wicked, He did not stumble for it in the day of his turning from his wickedness, And the righteous is not able to live in it in the day of his sinning.
\v 13 In My saying of the righteous: He surely lived, And — he had trusted on his righteousness, And he had done perversity, All his righteous acts are not remembered, And for his perversity that he had done, For it he did die.
\v 14 And in My saying to the wicked: You surely diest, And — he had turned back from his sin, And had done judgment and righteousness,
\v 15 (The pledge the wicked restoreth, plunder he repayeth,) In the statutes of life he had walked, So as not to do perversity, He surely lived — he did not die.
\v 16 None of his sin that he had sinned is remembered to him, Judgment and righteousness he had done, He did surely live.
\v 17 And the sons of your people have said: The way of the Lord is not pondered, As to them — their way is not pondered.
\v 18 In the turning back of the righteous from his righteousness, And he had done perversity — he dieth for it.
\v 19 And in the turning back of the wicked from his wickedness, And he had done judgment and righteousness, by them he lived.
\v 20 And you have said: The way of the Lord is not pondered, Each according to his ways do I judge you, O house of Israel.'
\v 21 And it came to pass, in the twelfth year — in the tenth month, in the fifth of the month — of our removal, come in unto me did one who is escaped from Jerusalem, saying, 'The city had been smitten.'
\v 22 And the hand of Yahweh had been unto me in the evening, before the coming in of the escaped one, and He opened my mouth till the coming in unto me in the morning, and opened is my mouth, and I have not been silent again.
\v 23 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 24 Son of man, the inhabitants of these wastes on the ground of Israel are speaking, saying: Alone had been Abraham — and he possesseth the land, and we are many — to us had the land been given for a possession.
\v 25 Therefore say unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: With the blood you do eat, And your eyes you lift up unto your idols, And blood you shed, and the land you inherit!
\v 26 Ye have stood on your sword, Ye have done abomination, Each the wife of his neighbour you have defiled, And the land you possess!
\v 27 Thus will you say unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: I live — do not they who are in the wastes by the sword fall? And they who are on the face of the field, To the beast I have given for food, And they who are in strongholds and in caves by pestilence die.
\v 28 And I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, And ceased had the excellency of its strength, And desolated have been mountains of Israel, Without any one passing through.
\v 29 And they have known that I am Yahweh, In My making the land a desolation and an astonishment, For all their abominations that they have done.
\v 30 And you, son of man, the sons of your people who are speaking about you, By the walls, and in openings of the houses, Have spoken one with another, each with his brother, Saying: Come in, I pray you, And hear what is the word that came out from Yahweh.
\v 31 And they come in unto you as the coming in of a people, And they sit before you — My people, And have heard your words, and they do them not, For doting loves with their mouth they are making, After their dishonest gain their heart is going.
\v 32 And behold, you are to them as a singer of doting loves, A pleasant voice, and playing well on an instrument, And they have heard your words, and they are not doing them.
\v 33 And in its coming in — behold, it had come, And they have known that a prophet had been in their middle!'
\c 34
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy concerning shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and you hast said unto them: To the shepherds, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, Who have been feeding themselves! The flock do not the shepherds feed?
\v 3 The fat you do eat, and the wool you put on, The fed one you slaughter, the flock you feed not.
\v 4 The weak you have not strengthened, And the sick one you have not healed, And the broken you have not bound up, And the driven away have not brought back, And the lost you have not sought, And with might you have ruled them and with rigour.
\v 5 And they are scattered from want of a shepherd, And are for food to every beast of the field, Yea, they are scattered.
\v 6 Go astray do My flock on all the mountains, And on every high hill, And on all the face of the land have My flock been scattered, And there is none inquiring, and none seeking.
\v 7 Therefore, shepherds, hear a word of Yahweh:
\v 8 I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, If not, because of My flock being for a prey, Yea, My flock is for food to every beast of the field, Because there is no shepherd, And My shepherds have not sought My flock, And the shepherds do feed themselves, And My flock they have not fed.
\v 9 Therefore, O shepherds, hear a word of Yahweh:
\v 10 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against the shepherds, And have required My flock from their hand, And caused them to cease from feeding the flock, And no more do the shepherds feed themselves, And I have delivered My flock from their mouth, And they are not to them for food.
\v 11 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I — even I, have required My flock, And I have sought it out.
\v 12 As a shepherd's searching of his drove, In the day of his being in the middle of his scattered flock, so I do seek My flock, And have delivered them out of all places, Whither they have been scattered, In a day of cloud and thick darkness.
\v 13 And brought them out from the peoples, And have gathered them from the lands, And brought them unto their own ground, And have fed them on mountains of Israel, By streams, and by all dwellings of the land.
\v 14 With good pasture I do feed them, And on mountains of the high place of Israel is their habitation, There do they lie down in a good habitation, And fat pastures they enjoy on mountains of Israel.
\v 15 I feed My flock, and cause them to lie down, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 16 The lost I seek, and the driven away bring back, And the broken I bind up, and the sick I strengthen, And the fat and the strong I destroy, I feed it with judgment.
\v 17 And you, My flock, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am judging between sheep and sheep, Between rams and he-goats.
\v 18 Is it a little thing for you — the good pasture you enjoy, And the remnant of your pasture you tread down with your feet, And a depth of waters you do drink, And the remainder with your feet you trample,
\v 19 And My flock the trodden thing of your feet consumeth, And the trampled thing of your feet drinketh?
\v 20 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh to them: Lo, I — even I, have judged between fat sheep and lean sheep.
\v 21 Because with side and with shoulder you thrust away, And with your horns push all the diseased, Till you have scattered them to the out-place,
\v 22 And I have given safety to My flock, And they are not any more for prey, And I have judged between sheep and sheep.
\v 23 And have raised up over them one shepherd, And he had fed them — my servant David, He did feed them, and he is their shepherd,
\v 24 And I, Yahweh, I am their God, And My servant David prince in their middle, I, Yahweh, have spoken.
\v 25 And I have made for them a covenant of peace, And caused evil beasts to cease out of the land, And they have dwelt in a wilderness confidently, And they have slept in forests.
\v 26 And I have given them, and the suburbs of my hill, a blessing, And caused the shower to come down in its season, Showers of blessing they are.
\v 27 And given had the tree of the field its fruit, And the land did give her increase, And they have been on their land confident, And they have known that I am Yahweh, In My breaking the bands of their yoke, And I have delivered them from the hand of those laying service on them.
\v 28 And they are no more a prey to nations, And the beast of the earth devoureth them not, And they have dwelt confidently, And there is none troubling.
\v 29 And I have raised for them a plant for renown, And they are no more consumed by hunger in the land, And they bear no more the shame of the nations.
\v 30 And they have known that I, Yahweh, their God, am with them, And they — the house of Israel — My people, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 31 And you, My flock, the flock of My pasture, Men you are — I am your God, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 35
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 'Son of man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
\v 3 and you hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, O mount Seir, And have stretched out My hand against you, And made you a desolation and an astonishment.
\v 4 Your cities a waste I make, and you are a desolation, And you hast known that I am Yahweh.
\v 5 Because of your having an enmity age-during, And you will saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end:
\v 6 Therefore, I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Surely for blood I do appoint you, And blood did pursue you, If blood you hast not hated, Blood also did pursue you.
\v 7 And I have given mount Seir for a desolation and an astonishment, And have cut off from it him who is passing over and him who is returning,
\v 8 And filled his mountains with his wounded, Your hills, and your valleys, and all your streams, The pierced of the sword fall into them.
\v 9 Desolations age-during I make you, And your cities do not return, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 10 Because of your saying: The two nations and the two lands are mine, and we have possessed it, And Yahweh had been there;
\v 11 Therefore, I live — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, And I have done according to yours anger, And according to yours envy, With which you hast wrought, Because of your hatred against them, And I have been known among them when I judge you.
\v 12 And you hast known that I — Yahweh, I have heard all your despisings that you hast spoken Against mountains of Israel, saying: A desolation, to us they were given for food.
\v 13 And you magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth, And have made abundant against Me your words, I — I have heard.
\v 14 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: According to the rejoicing of the whole land, A desolation I make of you.
\v 15 According to your joy at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, So I do to you — a desolation you are, O mount Seir, and all Edom — all of it, And they have known that I am Yahweh!
\c 36
\v 1 And you, son of man, prophesy unto mountains of Israel, and you hast said, O mountains of Israel, hear a word of Yahweh.
\v 2 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because the enemy said against you, Aha, and the high places of old for a possession have been to us,
\v 3 therefore, prophesy, and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because, even because, of desolating, And of swallowing you up from round about, For your being a possession to the remnant of the nations, And you are taken up on the tip of the tongue, And are an evil report of the people.
\v 4 Therefore, O mountains of Israel, Hear a word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus said the Lord Yahweh, to mountains, and to hills, To streams, and to valleys, And to wastes that are desolate, And to cities that are forsaken, That have been for a prey, And for a scorn, to the remnant of the nations who are round about.
\v 5 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Have I not, in the fire of My jealousy, Spoken against the remnant of the nations, And against Edom — all of it, Who gave My land to themselves for a possession, With the joy of the whole heart — with despite of soul, For the sake of casting it out for a prey?
\v 6 Therefore, prophesy concerning the ground of Israel, And you hast said to mountains, and to hills, To streams, and to valleys, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I, in My jealousy, and in My fury, I have spoken, Because the shame of nations you have borne.
\v 7 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: I — I have lifted up My hand, Do not — the nations who are with you from round about — they their own shame bear?
\v 8 And you, O mountains of Israel, Your branch you give out, and your fruits you bear for My people Israel, For they have drawn near to come.
\v 9 For, behold, I am for you, and have turned to you, And you have been tilled and sown.
\v 10 And I have multiplied on you men, All the house of Israel — all of it, And the cities have been inhabited, And the wastes are built.
\v 11 And I have multiplied on you man and beast, And they have multiplied and been fruitful, And I have caused you to dwell according to your former states, And I have done better than at your beginnings, And you have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 12 And I have caused man to walk over you, — My people Israel, And they possess you, and you hast been to them for an inheritance, And you will add no more to bereave them.
\v 13 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because they are saying to you: A devourer of men are you, And a bereaver of your nations you hast been,
\v 14 Therefore, man you devourest no more, And your nations you causest not to stumble any more, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 15 And I proclaim not unto you any more the shame of the nations, And the reproach of peoples you bearest no more, And your nations stumble not any more, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\v 16 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 17 'Son of man, The house of Israel are dwelling on their land, And they defile it by their way and by their doings, As the uncleanness of a separated one had their way been before Me.
\v 18 And I do pour out My fury upon them For the blood that they shed on the land, And with their idols they have defiled it.
\v 19 And I scatter them among nations, And they are spread through lands, According to their way, and according to their doings, I have judged them.
\v 20 And one went in unto the nations where they have gone, And they pollute My holy name by saying to them, The people of Yahweh are these, And from His land they have gone forth.
\v 21 And I have pity on My holy name, That the house of Israel have polluted among nations where they have gone in.
\v 22 Therefore, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Not for your sake am I working, O house of Israel, But — for My holy name, That you have polluted among nations where you have gone in.
\v 23 And I have sanctified My great name, That is profaned among nations, That you have polluted in your middle, And known have the nations that I am Yahweh, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, In My being sanctified in you before your eyes.
\v 24 And I have taken you out of the nations, And have gathered you out of all the lands, And I have brought you in unto your land,
\v 25 And I have sprinkled over you clean water, And you have been clean; From all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols, I do cleanse you.
\v 26 And I have given to you a new heart, And a new spirit I give in your middle, And I have turned aside the heart of stone out of your flesh, And I have given to you a heart of flesh.
\v 27 And My Spirit I give in your middle, And I have done this, so that in My statutes you walk, And My judgments you keep, and have done them.
\v 28 And you have dwelt in the land that I have given to your fathers, And you have been to Me for a people, And I — I am to you for God.
\v 29 And I have saved you from all your uncleannesses, And I have called unto the corn, and multiplied it, And I have put no famine upon you.
\v 30 And I have multiplied the fruit of the tree, And the increase of the field, So that you receive not any more a reproach of famine among nations.
\v 31 And you have remembered your ways that are evil, And your doings that are not good, And have been loathsome in your own faces, For your iniquities, and for your abominations.
\v 32 Not for your sake am I working, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Be it known to you, Be ashamed and confounded, because of your ways, O house of Israel.
\v 33 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In the day of My cleansing you from all your iniquities, I have caused the cities to be inhabited, And the wastes have been built,
\v 34 And the desolate land is tilled, Instead of which it was a desolation before the eyes of every passer by,
\v 35 And they have said: This land, that was desolated, Hath been as the garden of Eden, And the cities — the wasted, And the desolated, and the broken down, Fenced places have remained.
\v 36 And known have the nations who are left round about you, That I Yahweh have built the thrown down, I have planted the desolated: I Yahweh have spoken, and I have done it.
\v 37 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Yet this I am required, By the house of Israel to do to them, I multiply them as a flock of men,
\v 38 As a flock of holy ones, as a flock of Jerusalem, In her appointed seasons, So are the waste cities full of flocks of men, And they have known that I am Yahweh!'
\c 37
\v 1 There had been upon me a hand of Yahweh, and He took me forth in the Spirit of Yahweh, and did place me in the middle of the valley, and it is full of bones,
\v 2 and He caused me to pass over by them, all round about, and behold, very many are on the face of the valley, and behold, very dry.
\v 3 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, do these bones live?' And I say, 'O Lord Yahweh, You — You hast known.'
\v 4 And He said unto me, 'Prophesy concerning these bones, and you hast said unto them: O dry bones, hear a word of Yahweh:
\v 5 Thus said the Lord Yahweh to these bones: Lo, I am bringing into you a spirit, and you have lived,
\v 6 and I have given on you sinews, and cause flesh to come up upon you, and covered you over with skin, and given in you a spirit, and you have lived, and you have known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 7 And I have prophesied as I have been commanded, and there is a noise, as I am prophesying, and behold, a rushing, and draw near do the bones, bone unto its bone.
\v 8 And I beheld, and behold, on them are sinews, and flesh had come up, and cover them did skin over above — and spirit there is none in them.
\v 9 And He said unto me: 'Prophesy unto the Spirit, prophesy, son of man, and you hast said unto the Spirit: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: From the four winds come in, O Spirit, and breathe on these killed, and they do live.'
\v 10 And I have prophesied as He commanded me, and the Spirit came into them, and they live, and stand on their feet — a very very great force.
\v 11 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they are saying: Dried up have our bones, And perished had our hope, We have been cut off by ourselves.
\v 12 Therefore, prophesy, and you hast said unto them, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am opening your graves, And have brought you up out of your graves, O My people, And brought you in unto the land of Israel.
\v 13 And you have known that I am Yahweh, In My opening your graves, And in My bringing you up out of your graves, O My people.
\v 14 And I have given My Spirit in you, and you have lived, And I have caused you to rest on your land, And you have known that I Yahweh, I have spoken, and I have done it, An affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 15 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 16 'And you, son of man, take to you one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel, his companions; and take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions,
\v 17 and bring them near one unto another, to you, for one stick, and they have become one in your hand.
\v 18 And when sons of your people speak unto you, saying, Dost you not declare to us what these are to you?
\v 19 Speak unto them, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am taking the stick of Joseph, that is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and have given them unto him, with the stick of Judah, and have made them become one stick, and they have been one in My hand.
\v 20 And the sticks on which you writest have been in your hand before yours eyes,
\v 21 and speak you unto them: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am taking the sons of Israel, From among the nations where they have gone, And have gathered them from round about, And I have brought them in unto their land.
\v 22 And I have made them become one nation in the land, on mountains of Israel, And one king is to them all for king, And they are no more as two nations, Nor are they divided any more into two kingdoms again.
\v 23 Nor are they defiled any more with their idols, And with their abominations, And with any of their transgressions, And I have saved them out of all their dwellings, In which they have sinned, And I have cleansed them, And they have been to Me for a people, And I — I am to them for God.
\v 24 And My servant David is king over them, And one shepherd have they all, And in My judgments they go, And My statutes they keep, and have done them.
\v 25 And they have dwelt on the land that I gave to My servant, to Jacob, In which your fathers have dwelt, And they have dwelt on it, they and their sons, And their son's sons — unto the age, And David My servant is their prince — to the age.
\v 26 And I have made to them a covenant of peace, A covenant age-during it is with them, And I have placed them, and multiplied them, And placed My sanctuary in their middle — to the age.
\v 27 And My tabernacle had been over them, And I have been to them for God, And they have been to Me for a people.
\v 28 And known have the nations that I Yahweh am sanctifying Israel, In My sanctuary being in their middle — to the age!'
\c 38
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 'Son of man, set your face unto Gog, of the land of Magog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy concerning him,
\v 3 and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, O Gog, Prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal,
\v 4 And I have turned you back, And I have put hooks in your jaws, And have brought you out, and all your force, Horses and horsemen, Clothed in perfection all of them, A numerous assembly, with buckler and shield, Handling swords — all of them.
\v 5 Persia, Cush, and Phut, with them, All of them with shield and helmet.
\v 6 Gomer and all its bands, The house of Togarmah of the sides of the north, And all its bands, many peoples with you,
\v 7 Be prepared, yea, prepare for you, You and all yours assemblies who are assembled unto you, And you hast been to them for a guard.
\v 8 After many days you are appointed, In the latter end of the years you comest in unto a land brought back from sword, A people gathered out of many peoples, Upon mountains of Israel, That have been for a perpetual waste, And it from the peoples had been brought out, And dwelt safely have all of them.
\v 9 And you hast gone up — as wasting you comest in, As a cloud to cover the land are you, You and all your bands, and many peoples with you.
\v 10 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: And it had come to pass in that day, Come up do things on your heart, And you hast thought an evil thought,
\v 11 And you hast said: I go up against a land of unwalled villages, I go in to those at rest, dwelling confidently, All of them are dwelling without walls, And bar and doors they have not.
\v 12 To take a spoil, and to take a prey, To turn back your hand on inhabited wastes, And on a people gathered out of nations, Making cattle and substance, Dwelling on a high part of the land.
\v 13 Sheba, and Dedan, and merchants of Tarshish, And all its young lions say to you: To take a spoil are you come in? To take a prey assembled yours assembly? To bear away silver and gold? To take away cattle and substance? To take a great spoil?
\v 14 Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and you hast said to Gog: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In that day, in the dwelling of My people Israel safely, Dost you not know?
\v 15 And you hast come in out of your place, From the sides of the north, You and many peoples with you, Riding on horses — all of them, A great assembly, and a numerous force.
\v 16 And you hast come up against My people Israel, As a cloud to cover the land, In the latter end of the days it is, And I have brought you in against My land, In order that the nations may know Me, In My being sanctified in you before their eyes, O Gog.
\v 17 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Art you he of whom I spake in former days, By the hand of My servants, prophets of Israel, Who are prophesying in those days — years, To bring you in against them?
\v 18 And it had come to pass, in that day, In the day of the coming in of Gog against the land of Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Come up did My fury in My face,
\v 19 And in My zeal, in the fire of My wrath, I have spoken: Is there not in that day a great rushing on the land of Israel?
\v 20 And rushed from My presence have fishes of the sea, And the fowl of the heavens, And the beast of the field, And every creeping thing that is creeping on the ground, And all men who are on the face of the ground, And thrown down have been the mountains, And fallen have the ascents, And every wall to the earth falleth.
\v 21 And I have called against him, to all My mountains a sword, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, The sword of each is against his brother.
\v 22 And I have been judged with him, With pestilence and with blood, And an overflowing rain and hailstones, Fire and brimstone I rain on him, and on his bands, And on many peoples who are with him.
\v 23 And I have magnified Myself, and sanctified Myself, And I have been known before the eyes of many nations, And they have known that I am Yahweh!
\c 39
\v 1 And you, son of man, prophesy concerning Gog, and you hast said: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, I am against you, O Gog, Prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal,
\v 2 And have turned you back, and enticed you, And caused you to come up from the sides of the north, And brought you in against mountains of Israel,
\v 3 And have smitten your bow out of your left hand, Yea, yours arrows out of your right I cause to fall.
\v 4 On mountains of Israel you fallest, You, and all your bands, and the peoples who are with you, To ravenous fowl — a bird of every wing, And to a beast of the field, I have given you for food.
\v 5 On the face of the field you fallest, for I have spoken, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 6 And I have sent a fire against Magog, And against the confident inhabitants of the isles, And they have known that I am Yahweh.
\v 7 And My holy name I make known in the middle of My people Israel, And I pollute not My holy name any more, And known have the nations that I, Yahweh, the Holy One, am in Israel.
\v 8 Lo, it had come, and it had been done, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, It is the day of which I spake.
\v 9 And gone out have the inhabitants of cities of Israel, And they have burned and kindled a fire, With armour, and shield, and buckler, With bow, and with arrows, And with hand-staves, and with javelins, And they have caused a fire to burn with them seven years,
\v 10 And they do not take wood out of the field, Nor do they hew out of the forests, For with armour they cause the fire to burn, And they have spoiled their spoilers, And they have plundered their plunderers, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 11 And it had come to pass, in that day, I give to Gog a place there — a grave in Israel, the valley of those passing by, east of the sea, and it is stopping those passing by, and they have buried there Gog, and all his multitude, and have cried, O valley of the multitude of Gog!
\v 12 And the house of Israel have buried them — in order to cleanse the land — seven months.
\v 13 Yea, all the people of the land have buried them, and it had been to them for a name — the day of My being honoured — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 14 And men for continual employment they separate, passing on through the land, burying with those passing by those who are left on the face of the earth, to cleanse it: at the end of seven months they search.
\v 15 And those passing by have passed through the land, and seen a bone of man, and one had constructed near it a sign till those burying have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.
\v 16 And also the name of the city is The multitude; and they have cleansed the land.
\v 17 And you, son of man, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Say to the bird — every wing, and to every beast of the field: Be assembled and come in, Be gathered from round about, For My sacrifice that I am sacrificing for you, A great sacrifice on mountains of Israel, And you have eaten flesh, and drunk blood.
\v 18 Flesh of the mighty you do eat, And blood of princes of the earth you drink, Of rams, of lambs, and of he-goats, Of calves, fatlings of Bashan — all of them.
\v 19 And you have eaten fat to satiety, And you have drunk blood — to drunkenness, Of My sacrifice that I sacrificed for you.
\v 20 And you have been satisfied at My table with horse and rider, Mighty man, and every man of war, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 21 And I have given My honour among nations, And seen have all the nations My Judgment that I have done, And My hand that I have laid on them.
\v 22 And known have the house of Israel that I am Yahweh their God, From that day and henceforth.
\v 23 And known have the nations that for their iniquity, Removed have the house of Israel, Because they have trespassed against Me, And I do hide My face from them, And give them into the hand of their adversaries, And they fall by sword — all of them.
\v 24 According to their uncleanness, And according to their transgressions, I have done with them, And I do hide My face from them.
\v 25 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Now do I bring back the captivity of Jacob, And I have pitied all the house of Israel, And have been zealous for My holy name.
\v 26 And they have forgotten their shame, And all their trespass that they trespassed against Me, In their dwelling on their land confidently and none troubling.
\v 27 In My bringing them back from the peoples, I have assembled them from the lands of their enemies, And I have been sanctified in them before the eyes of the many nations,
\v 28 And they have known that I am Yahweh their God, In My removing them unto the nations, And I have gathered them unto their land, And I leave none of them any more there.
\v 29 And I hide not any more My face from them, In that I have poured out My spirit on the house of Israel, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh!'
\c 40
\v 1 In the twenty and fifth year of our removal, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in this self-same day had a hand of Yahweh been upon me, and He brought me in thither;
\v 2 in visions of God He had brought me in unto the land of Israel, and caused me to rest on a very high mountain, and upon it is as the frame of a city on the south.
\v 3 And He brought me in thither, and behold, a man, his appearance as the appearance of brass, and a thread of flax in his hand, and a measuring-reed, and he is standing at the gate,
\v 4 and the man spoke unto me: 'Son of man, see with yours eyes, And with yours ears hear, And set your heart to all that I am shewing you, For, in order to shew it you, You hast been brought in hither, Declare all that you are seeing to the house of Israel.'
\v 5 And behold, a wall on the outside of the house all round about, and in the hand of the man a measuring-reed, six cubits by a cubit and a handbreadth, and he measureth the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.
\v 6 And he came in unto the gate whose front is eastward, and he went up by its steps, and he measureth the threshold of the gate one reed broad, even the one threshold one reed broad,
\v 7 and the little chamber one reed long and one reed broad, and between the little chambers five cubits, and the threshold of the gate, from the side of the porch of the gate from within, one reed.
\v 8 And he measureth the porch of the gate from within one reed,
\v 9 and he measureth the porch of the gate eight cubits, and its posts two cubits, and the porch of the gates from within,
\v 10 and the little chambers of the gate eastward, three on this side, and three on that side; one measure is to them three, and one measure is to the posts, on this side and on that side.
\v 11 And he measureth the breadth of the opening of the gate ten cubits, the length of the gate thirteen cubits;
\v 12 and a border before the little chambers, one cubit, and one cubit is the border on this side, and the little chamber is six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\v 13 And he measureth the gate from the roof of the one little chamber to the roof of another; the breadth twenty and five cubits, opening over-against opening.
\v 14 And he made the posts of sixty cubits, even unto the post of the court, the gate all round about;
\v 15 and by the front of the gate of the entrance, by the front of the porch of the inner gate, fifty cubits;
\v 16 and narrow windows are unto the little chambers, and unto their posts at the inside of the gate all round about — and so to the arches — and windows all round about are at the inside, and at the post are palm-trees.
\v 17 And he brought me in unto the outer court, and behold, chambers and a pavement made for the court all round about — thirty chambers on the pavement — 
\v 18 and the pavement unto the side of the gates over-against the length of the gates is the lower pavement;
\v 19 and he measureth the breadth from before the lower gate, to the front of the inner court, on the outside, a hundred cubits, eastward and northward.
\v 20 As to the gate of the outer court whose front is northward, he had measured its length and its breadth;
\v 21 and its little chambers, three on this side, and three on that side, and its posts and its arches have been according to the measure of the first gate, fifty cubits its length, and the breadth five and twenty by the cubit;
\v 22 and its windows, and its arches, and its palm-trees are according to the measure of the gate whose face is eastward, and by seven steps they go up on it, and its arches are before them.
\v 23 And the gate of the inner court is over-against the gate at the north and at the east; and he measureth from gate unto gate, a hundred cubits.
\v 24 And he caused me to go southward, and behold, a gate southward, and he had measured its posts and its arches according to these measures;
\v 25 and windows are to it and to its arches all round about, like these windows, fifty cubits the length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits;
\v 26 and seven steps are its ascent, and its arches are before them, and palm-trees are to it, one on this side, and one on that side, at its posts;
\v 27 and the gate of the inner court is southward, and he measureth from gate unto gate southward, a hundred cubits.
\v 28 And he brought me in unto the inner court by the south gate, and he measureth the south gate according to these measures;
\v 29 and its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches are according to these measures, and windows are to it and to its arches all round about; fifty cubits the length, and the breadth twenty and five cubits.
\v 30 As to the arches all round about, the length is five and twenty cubits, and the breadth five cubits;
\v 31 and its arches are unto the outer court, and palm-trees are unto its posts, and eight steps are its ascent.
\v 32 And he brought me in unto the inner court eastward, and he measureth the gate according to these measures;
\v 33 and its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches are according to these measures: and windows are to it and to its arches all round about, the length fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits;
\v 34 and its arches are toward the outer court, and palm-trees are toward its posts, on this side and on that side, and eight steps are its ascent.
\v 35 And he brought me in unto the north gate, and had measured according to these measures;
\v 36 its little chambers, its posts, and its arches; and windows are to it all round about: the length fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits;
\v 37 and its posts are to the outer court, and palm-trees are unto its posts, on this side and on that side, and eight steps are its ascent.
\v 38 And the chamber and its opening is by the posts of the gates, there they purge the burnt-offering.
\v 39 And in the porch of the gate are two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slaughter on them the burnt-offering, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering;
\v 40 and at the side without, at the going up to the opening of the north gate, are two tables; and at the other side that is at the porch of the gate, are two tables;
\v 41 four tables are on this side, and four tables on that side, at the side of the gate, eight tables on which they slaughter.
\v 42 And the four tables for burnt-offering are of hewn stone: the length one cubit and a half, and the breadth one cubit and a half, and the height one cubit: on them they place the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
\v 43 And the boundaries are one handbreadth, prepared within all round about: and on the tables is the flesh of the offering.
\v 44 And on the outside of the inner gate are chambers of the singers, in the inner court, that are at the side of the north gate, and their fronts are southward, one at the side of the east gate had the front northward.
\v 45 And he spoke unto me: 'This chamber, whose front is southward, is for priests keeping charge of the house;
\v 46 and the chamber, whose front is northward, is for priests keeping charge of the altar: they are sons of Zadok, who are drawing near of the sons of Levi unto Yahweh, to serve Him.'
\v 47 And he measureth the court: the length a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, square, and the altar is before the house.
\v 48 And he brought me in unto the porch of the house, and he measureth the post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side, and the breadth of the gate, three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side;
\v 49 the length of the porch twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and by the steps whereby they go up unto it: and pillars are at the posts, one on this side, and one on that side.
\c 41
\v 1 And he brought me in unto the temple, and he measureth the posts, six cubits the breadth on this side, and six cubits the breadth on that side — the breadth of the tent.
\v 2 And the breadth of the opening is ten cubits; and the sides of the opening are five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and he measureth its length forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\v 3 And he had gone inward, and measureth the post of the opening two cubits, and the opening six cubits, and the breadth of the opening seven cubits.
\v 4 And he measureth its length twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, unto the front of the temple, and he said unto me, 'This is the holy of holies.'
\v 5 And he measureth the wall of the house six cubits, and the breadth of the side-chamber four cubits, all round the house round about.
\v 6 And the side-chambers are side-chamber by side-chamber, three and thirty times; and they are entering into the wall — which the house had for the side-chambers all round about — to be taken hold of, and they are not taken hold of by the wall of the house.
\v 7 And a broad place and a turning place still upwards are to the side-chambers, for the turning round of the house is still upwards all round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house is upwards, and so the lower one went up unto the higher by the middle.
\v 8 And I have looked at the house, the height all round about: the foundations of the side-chambers are the fulness of the reed, six cubits by the joining.
\v 9 The breadth of the wall that is to the side-chamber at the outside is five cubits; and that which is left is the place of the side-chambers that are to the house.
\v 10 And between the chambers is a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house, all round about.
\v 11 And the opening of the side-chamber is to the place left, one opening northward, and one opening southward, and the breadth of the place that is left is five cubits all round about.
\v 12 As to the building that is at the front of the separate place at the corner westward, the breadth is seventy cubits, and the wall of the building five cubits broad all round about, and its length ninety cubits.
\v 13 And he had measured the house, the length is a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and the building, and its walls, the length is a hundred cubits;
\v 14 and the breadth of the front of the house, and of the separate place eastward, a hundred cubits.
\v 15 And he had measured the length of the building unto the front of the separate place that is at its hinder part, and its galleries on this side and on that side, a hundred cubits, and the inner temple and the porches of the court,
\v 16 the thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about them three, over-against the threshold, a ceiling of wood all round about, and the ground unto the windows and the covered windows,
\v 17 over above the opening, and unto the inner-house, and at the outside, and by all the wall all round about within and without by measure.
\v 18 And it is made with cherubs and palm-trees, and a palm-tree is between cherub and cherub, and two faces are to the cherub;
\v 19 and the face of man is unto the palm-tree on this side, and the face of a young lion unto the palm-tree on that side; it is made unto all the house all round about.
\v 20 from the earth unto above the opening are the cherubs and the palm-trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
\v 21 Of the temple the side post is square, and of the front of the sanctuary, the appearance is as the appearance.
\v 22 Of the altar, the wood is three cubits in height, and its length two cubits; and its corners are to it, and its length, and its walls are of wood, and he spoke unto me, 'This is the table that is before Yahweh.'
\v 23 And two doors are to the temple and to the sanctuary;
\v 24 and two leaves are to the doors, two turning leaves are to the doors, two to the one door, and two leaves to the other.
\v 25 And made on them, on the doors of the temple, are cherubs and palm-trees as are made on the walls, and a thickness of wood is at the front of the porch on the outside.
\v 26 And narrow windows and palm-trees are on this side, and on that side, at the sides of the porch, and the side-chambers of the house, and the thick places.
\c 42
\v 1 And he brought me forth unto the outer court, the way northward, and he brought me in unto the chamber that is over-against the separate place, and that is over-against the building at the north.
\v 2 At the front of the length is a hundred cubits at the north opening, and the breadth fifty cubits.
\v 3 Over-against the twenty cubits that are to the inner court, and over-against the pavement that is to the outer court, is gallery over-against gallery, in the three storeys.
\v 4 And at the front of the chambers is a walk of ten cubits in breadth unto the inner part, a way of one cubit, and their openings are at the north.
\v 5 And the upper chambers are short, for the galleries contain more than these, than the lower, and than the middle one, of the building;
\v 6 for they are threefold, and they have no pillars as the pillars of the court, therefore it had been kept back — more than the lower and than the middle one — from the ground.
\v 7 As to the wall that is at the outside, over-against the chambers, the way of the outer-court at the front of the chambers, its length is fifty cubits;
\v 8 for the length of the chambers that are to the outer court is fifty cubits, and of those on the front of the temple a hundred cubits.
\v 9 And under these chambers is the entrance from the east, in one's going into them from the outer court.
\v 10 In the breadth of the wall of the court eastward, unto the front of the separate place, and unto the front of the building, are chambers.
\v 11 And the way before them is as the appearance of the chambers that are northward, according to their length so is their breadth, and all their outlets, and according to their fashions, and according to their openings.
\v 12 And according to the openings of the chambers that are southward is an opening at the head of the way, the way directly in the front of the wall eastward in entering them.
\v 13 And he said unto me, 'The north chambers, the south chambers, that are at the front of the separate place, they are holy chambers, where the priests (who are near to Yahweh) eat the most holy things, there they place the most holy things, and the present, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, for the place is holy.
\v 14 In the priests' going in, they come not out from the sanctuary unto the outer court, and there they place their garments with which they minister, for they are holy, and have put on other garments, and have drawn near unto that which is for the people.'
\v 15 And he had finished the measurements of the inner house, and had brought me forth the way of the gate whose front is eastward, and he had measured it all round about.
\v 16 He had measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about.
\v 17 He had measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\v 18 The south side he had measured, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed.
\v 19 He had turned round unto the west side, he had measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.
\v 20 At the four sides he had measured it, a wall is to it all round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to separate between the holy and the profane place.
\c 43
\v 1 And he caused me to go to the gate, the gate that is looking eastward.
\v 2 And behold, the honour of the God of Israel had come from the way of the east, and His voice is as the noise of many waters, and the earth had shone from His honour.
\v 3 And according to the appearance is the appearance that I saw, as the appearance that I saw in my coming in to destroy the city, and the appearances are as the appearance that I saw at the river Chebar, and I fall on my face.
\v 4 And the honour of Yahweh had come in unto the house, the way of the gate whose face is eastward.
\v 5 And take me up did the Spirit, and brought me in unto the inner court, and behold, the honour of Yahweh had filled the house.
\v 6 And I hear one speaking unto me from the house, and a man had been standing near me,
\v 7 and He said unto me: 'Son of man, the place of My throne, And the place of the soles of My feet, Where I dwell in the middle of the sons of Israel to the age, Defile no more do the house of Israel My holy name, They, and their kings, by their whoredom, And by the carcases of their kings — their high places.
\v 8 In their putting their threshold with My threshold, And their door-post near My door-post, And the wall between Me and them, And they have defiled My holy name, By their abominations that they have done, And I consume them in Mine anger.
\v 9 Now do they put far off their whoredom, And the carcases of their kings — from Me, And I have dwelt in their middle to the age.
\v 10 You, son of man, Shew the house of Israel the house, And they are ashamed of their iniquities, And they have measured the measurement.
\v 11 And since they have been ashamed of all that they have done, The form of the house, and its measurement, And its outlets, and its inlets, and all its forms, And all its statutes, even all its forms, And all its laws cause them to know, And write it before their eyes, And they observe all its forms, And all its statutes, and have done them.
\v 12 This is a law of the house: on the top of the mountain, all its border all round about is most holy; behold, this is a law of the house.
\v 13 And these are measures of the altar by cubits: The cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth, and the centre is a cubit, and a cubit the breadth; and its border on its edge round about is one span, and this is the upper part of the altar.
\v 14 And from the centre of the ground unto the lower border is two cubits, and the breadth one cubit, and from the lesser border unto the greater border four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
\v 15 And the altar is four cubits, and from the altar and upward are four horns.
\v 16 And the altar is twelve long by twelve broad, square in its four squares.
\v 17 And the border is fourteen long by fourteen broad, at its four squares, and the border round about it is half a cubit, and the centre to it is a cubit round about, and its steps are looking eastward.'
\v 18 And He said unto me, 'Son of man, Thus said the Lord Yahweh: These are statutes of the altar in the day of its being made to cause burnt-offering to go up on it, and to sprinkle on it blood.
\v 19 And you hast given unto the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of Zadok — who are near unto Me, an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, to serve Me — a calf from the herd, for a sin-offering.
\v 20 And you hast taken of its blood, and hast put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of its border, and on the border round about, and hast cleansed it, and purified it.
\v 21 And you hast taken the bullock of the sin-offering, and hast burnt it in the appointed place of the house at the outside of the sanctuary.
\v 22 And on the second day you will bring near a kid of the goats, a perfect one, for a sin-offering, and they have cleansed the altar, as they cleansed it for the bullock.
\v 23 In your finishing cleansing, you will bring near a calf, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and a ram out of the flock, a perfect one.
\v 24 And you hast brought them near before Yahweh, and the priests have cast upon them salt, and have caused them to go up, a burnt-offering to Yahweh.
\v 25 Seven days you will prepare a goat for a sin-offering daily, and a bullock, a son of the herd, and a ram out of the flock, perfect ones, do they prepare.
\v 26 Seven days they purify the altar, and have cleansed it, and filled their hand.
\v 27 And the days are completed, and it had come to pass on the eighth day, and henceforth, the priests prepare on the altar your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings, and I have accepted you — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.'
\c 44
\v 1 And he caused me to turn back the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary that is looking eastward, and it is shut.
\v 2 And Yahweh said unto me, 'This gate is shut, it is not opened, and none did go in by it, for Yahweh, God of Israel, had come in by it, and it had been shut.
\v 3 The prince, who is prince, he sitteth by it to eat bread before Yahweh, by the way of the porch of the gate he came in, and by its way he went out.'
\v 4 And he brought me in the way of the north gate unto the front of the house, and I look, and behold, filled had the honour of Yahweh the house of Yahweh, and I fall on my face.
\v 5 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Son of man, set your heart, and see with yours eyes, and with yours ears hear, all that I am speaking with you, of all the statutes of the house of Yahweh, and of all its laws; and you hast set your heart to the entrance of the house, with all the outlets of the sanctuary,
\v 6 and hast said unto the rebellious, unto the house of Israel: Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Enough to you — of all your abominations, O house of Israel.
\v 7 In your bringing in sons of a stranger, uncircumcised of heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to pollute it, even My house, in your bringing near My bread, fat, and blood, and they break My covenant by all your abominations,
\v 8 and you have not kept the charge of My holy things, and you set them for keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for you.
\v 9 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: No son of a stranger, uncircumcised of heart, and uncircumcised of flesh, came in unto My sanctuary, even any son of a stranger, who is in the middle of the sons of Israel,
\v 10 but — the Levites who have gone far off from me, in the wandering of Israel when they went astray from Me after their idols, and they have borne their iniquity.
\v 11 And they have been in My sanctuary ministrants, overseers at the gates of the house, and ministrants at the house; they slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they stand before them to serve them.
\v 12 Because that they serve them before their idols, and have been to the house of Israel for a stumbling-block of iniquity, therefore I have lifted up my hand against them — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh — and they have borne their iniquity.
\v 13 And they draw not nigh unto Me to act as My priest, and to draw nigh unto any of My holy things, unto the holy of holies, and they have borne their shame and their abominations that they have done,
\v 14 and I made them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service and for all that is done in it.
\v 15 And the priests, the Levites, sons of Zadok, who have kept the charge of My sanctuary in the wandering of the sons of Israel from off Me, they draw near unto Me to serve Me, and have stood before Me, to bring near to Me fat and blood — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh:
\v 16 they come in unto My sanctuary, and they draw near unto My table to serve Me, and they have kept My charge.
\v 17 And it had come to pass, in their going in unto the gates of the inner court, linen garments they put on; and no wool came up on them in their ministering in the gates of the inner court and within.
\v 18 Linen bonnets are on their head, and linen trousers are on their loins, they are not restrained with sweat.
\v 19 And in their going forth unto the outer court — unto the outer court unto the people — they strip off their garments, in which they are ministering, and have placed them in the holy chambers, and have put on other garments; and they do not sanctify the people in their own garments.
\v 20 And their head they do not shave, and the lock they do not send forth; they certainly poll their heads.
\v 21 And no priest did drink wine in their coming in unto the inner court.
\v 22 And a widow and divorced woman they do not take to them for wives: but — virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, and the widow who is widow of a priest, do they take.
\v 23 'And My people they direct between holy and common, and between unclean and clean they cause them to discern.
\v 24 And concerning controversy, they stand up for judgment; with My judgments they judge it; and My law and My statutes in all My appointed places they keep; and My sabbaths they sanctify.
\v 25 And unto any dead man they come not for uncleanness, but for father, and for mother, and for son, and for daughter, for brother, for sister who had not been to a man, they defile themselves.
\v 26 'And after his cleansing, seven days they number to him.
\v 27 And in the day of his coming in unto the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he brought near his sin-offering — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 28 And it had been to them for an inheritance; I am their inheritance: and a possession you do not give to them in Israel; I am their possession.
\v 29 The present, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, they do eat, and every devoted thing in Israel is theirs.
\v 30 And the first of all the first-fruits of all, and every heave-offering of all, of all your heave-offerings, are the priests': and the first of your dough you give to the priest, to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
\v 31 Any carcase and torn thing, of the fowl, and of the beasts, the priests do not eat.
\c 45
\v 1 And in your causing the land to fall in inheritance, you lift up a heave-offering to Yahweh, a holy portion of the land: the length — five and twenty thousand is the length, and the breadth ten thousand; it is holy in all its border round about.
\v 2 There is of this for the sanctuary five hundred by five hundred, square, round about; and fifty cubits of suburb is to it round about.
\v 3 And by this measure you will measure: the length is five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand: and in it is the sanctuary, the holy of holies.
\v 4 The holy portion of the land it is; for priests, ministrants of the sanctuary, it is, who are drawing near to serve Yahweh; and it had been to them a place for houses, and a holy place for a sanctuary.
\v 5 And of the five and twenty thousand of length, and of the ten thousand of breadth, there is to the Levites, ministrants of the house, for them — for a possession — twenty chambers.
\v 6 And of the possession of the city you give five thousand of breadth, and of length five and twenty thousand, over-against the heave-offering of the holy portion: to all the house of Israel it is.
\v 7 As to the prince, on this side, and on that side, of the heave-offering of the holy place, and of the possession of the city, at the front of the heave-offering of the holy place, and at the front of the possession of the city, from the west corner westward, and from the east corner eastward — and the length is over-against one of the portions from the west border unto the east border — 
\v 8 of the land there is to him for a possession in Israel, and My princes do not oppress any more My people, and the land they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
\v 9 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: Enough to you — princes of Israel; violence and spoil turn aside, and judgment and righteousness do; lift up your exactions from off My people — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 10 Just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath — you have.
\v 11 The ephah and the bath is of one measure, for the bath to bear a tenth of the homer, and the ephah a tenth of the homer: according to the homer is its measurement.
\v 12 And, the shekel is twenty gerah: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels — is your maneh.
\v 13 This is the heave-offering that you lift up; a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of wheat, also you have given a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of barley,
\v 14 and the portion of oil, the bath of oil, a tenth part of the bath out of the cor, a homer of ten baths — for ten baths are a homer;
\v 15 and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the watered country of Israel, for a present, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement by them — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 16 All the people of the land are at this heave-offering for the prince in Israel.
\v 17 And on the prince are the burnt-offerings, and the present, and the libation, in feasts, and in new moons, and in sabbaths, in all appointed times of the house of Israel: he did make the sin-offering, and the present, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
\v 18 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: In the first month, in the first of the month, you will take a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and hast cleansed the sanctuary:
\v 19 and the priest had taken of the blood of the sin offering, and had put on the door-post of the house, and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the post of the gate of the inner court.
\v 20 And so you will do on the seventh of the month, because of each erring one, and because of the simple one — and you have purified the house.
\v 21 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, you have the passover, a feast of seven days, unleavened food is eaten.
\v 22 And the prince had prepared on that day, for himself, and for all the people of the land, a bullock, a sin-offering.
\v 23 And the seven days of the feast he prepared a burnt-offering to Yahweh, seven bullocks, and seven rams, perfect ones, daily seven days, and a sin-offering, a kid of the goats, daily.
\v 24 And a present of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, he did prepare, and of oil a hin for an ephah.
\v 25 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, he did according to these things seven days; as the sin-offering so the burnt-offering, and as the present so also the oil.
\c 46
\v 1 'Thus said the Lord Yahweh: The gate of the inner court that is looking eastward is shut the six days of work, and on the day of rest it is opened, and in the day of the new moon it is opened;
\v 2 and come in had the prince the way of the porch of the gate at the outside, and he had stood by the post of the gate, and the priests have made his burnt-offering, and his peace-offerings, and he had bowed himself by the opening of the gate, and had gone forth, and the gate is not shut till the evening.
\v 3 And bowed themselves have the people of the land at the opening of that gate, on sabbaths, and on new moons, before Yahweh.
\v 4 And the burnt-offering that the prince brought near to Yahweh on the day of rest is six lambs, perfect ones, and a ram, a perfect one.
\v 5 And the present is an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs a present, the gift of his hand, and of oil a hin for an ephah.
\v 6 And on the day of the new moon a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and six lambs and a ram, they are perfect.
\v 7 And with an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, he prepared a present, and for the lambs as his hand attaineth, and of oil a hin for an ephah.
\v 8 'And in the coming in of the prince, the way of the porch of the gate he came in, and by its way he went out.
\v 9 And in the coming in of the people of the land before Yahweh at appointed times, he who had come in the way of the north gate to bow himself, went out the way of the south gate, and he who had come in the way of the south gate, went out by the way of the north gate: he did not turn back the way of the gate by which he came in, but over-against it he went out.
\v 10 And the prince in their middle in their coming in came in, and in their going out he went out.
\v 11 'And in feasts, and in appointed times, the present is an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for lambs the gift of his hand, and of oil a hin for an ephah.
\v 12 And when the prince made a free-will burnt-offering, or free-will peace-offerings, to Yahweh, then he had opened for himself the gate that is looking eastward, and he had made his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings as he did in the day of rest, and he had gone out, and he had shut the gate after his going out.
\v 13 'And a lamb, son of a year, a perfect one, you will make a burnt-offering daily to Yahweh; morning by morning you will make it.
\v 14 And a present you will make for it morning by morning, a sixth part of the ephah, and of oil a third part of the hin, to temper with the fine flour, a present to Yahweh, by a statute age-during — continually;
\v 15 and prepare you the lamb, and the present, and the oil, morning by morning, a continual burnt-offering.
\v 16 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: When the prince gave a gift to any of his sons, his inheritance it is, to his sons it is; their possession it is by inheritance.
\v 17 And when he gave a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it had been to him till the year of freedom, and it had turned back to the prince, only the inheritance of his sons is theirs.
\v 18 And the prince did not take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them, out of their possession, out of his own possession he did cause his sons to inherit, so that My people are not scattered each from his possession.'
\v 19 And he brought me in through the entrance that is by the side of the gate, unto the holy chambers, unto the priests, that are looking northward, and behold, there is a place in their two sides westward.
\v 20 And he said unto me, 'This is the place where the priests do boil the guilt-offering and the sin-offering, where they bake the present, so as not to bring it out unto the outer court, to sanctify the people.'
\v 21 And he brought me out unto the outer court, and caused me to pass over unto the four corners of the court, and behold, a court in a corner of the court, a court in a corner of the corner.
\v 22 In the four corners of the court are perfume courts, forty long, and thirty broad, one measure is to the four corners.
\v 23 And a row is round about in them, round about to them four, and made with boilers under the rows round about.
\v 24 And he said unto me, 'These are the houses of those boiling where the ministrants of the house boil the sacrifice of the people.'
\c 47
\v 1 And he caused me to turn back unto the opening of the house; and behold, water is coming forth from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house is eastward, and the water is coming down from beneath, from the right side of the house, from the south of the altar.
\v 2 And he caused me to go out the way of the gate northward, and caused me to turn round the way without, unto the gate that is without, the way that is looking eastward, and behold, water is coming forth from the right side.
\v 3 In the going out of the man eastward, and a line in his hand, then he measureth a thousand by the cubit, and he caused me to pass over into water — water to the ankles.
\v 4 And he measureth a thousand, and caused me to pass over into water — water to the knees. And he measureth a thousand, and caused me to pass over — water to the loins.
\v 5 And he measureth a thousand — a stream that I am not able to pass over; for risen have the waters — waters to swim in — a stream that is not passed over.
\v 6 And he said unto me, 'Hast you seen, son of man?' and he leadeth me, and brought me back unto the edge of the stream.
\v 7 In my turning back, then, behold, at the edge of the stream are very many trees, on this side and on that side.
\v 8 And he said unto me, 'These waters are going forth unto the east circuit, and have gone down unto the desert, and have entered the sea; unto the sea they are brought forth, and the waters have been healed.
\v 9 And it had come to pass, every living creature that teemeth, wheresoever the streams come, did live: and there had been great abundance of fish, for these waters have come thither, and they are healed; and every thing where the stream came had lived.
\v 10 And it had come to pass, fishers do stand by it, from En-Gedi even unto En-Eglaim; a spreading place of nets they are; according to their own kind is their fish, as the fish of the great sea, very many.
\v 11 Its miry and its marshy places — they are not healed; to salt they have been given up.
\v 12 And by the stream there came up on its edge, on this side and on that side, every kind of fruit-tree whose leaf fadeth not, and not consumed is its fruit, according to its months it yieldeth first-fruits, because its waters from the sanctuary are coming forth; and its fruits had been for food, and its leaf for medicine.
\v 13 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: This is the border whereby you inherit the land, according to the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph had portions.
\v 14 And you have inherited it, one as well as another, in that I have lifted up My hand to give it to your fathers; and this land had fallen to you in inheritance.
\v 15 And this is the border of the land at the north quarter; from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, at the coming in to Zedad:
\v 16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, that is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-Hatticon, that is at the coast of Havran.
\v 17 And the border from the sea had been Hazar-Enan, the border of Damascus, and Zaphon at the north, and the border of Hamath: and this is the north quarter.
\v 18 And the east quarter is from between Havran, and Damascus, and Gilead, and the land of Israel, to the Jordan; from the border over-against the eastern sea you measure: and this is the east quarter.
\v 19 And the south quarter southward is from Tamar unto the waters of Meriboth-Kadesh, the stream unto the great sea: and this is the south quarter southward.
\v 20 And the west quarter is the great sea, from the border till over-against the coming in to Hamath: this is the west quarter.
\v 21 'And you have divided this land to you, according to the tribes of Israel;
\v 22 and it had come to pass, you separate it for an inheritance to yourselves, and to the sojourners who are sojourning in your middle, who have begotten sons in your middle, and they have been to you as native, with the sons of Israel, with you they are separated for an inheritance in the middle of the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 And it had come to pass, in the tribe with which the sojourner sojourneth, there you give his inheritance — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\c 48
\v 1 And these are the names of the tribes: From the north end unto the side of the way of Hethlon, at the coming in to Hamath, Hazar-Enan, the border of Damascus northward, unto the side of Hamath, and they have been his — side east and west, Dan one,
\v 2 and by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, Asher one,
\v 3 and by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, Naphtali one,
\v 4 and by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, Manasseh one,
\v 5 and by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, Ephraim one,
\v 6 and by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, Reuben one,
\v 7 and by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, Judah one,
\v 8 and by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side is the heave-offering that you lift up, five and twenty thousand broad and long, as one of the parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary had been in its middle.
\v 9 The heave-offering that you lift up to Yahweh is five and twenty thousand long, and broad ten thousand.
\v 10 And of these is the holy heave-offering for the priests, northward five and twenty thousand, and westward in breadth ten thousand, and eastward in breadth ten thousand, and southward in length five and twenty thousand: and the sanctuary of Yahweh had been in its middle.
\v 11 For the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who erred not in the erring of the sons of Israel, as the Levites erred,
\v 12 even the heave-offering had been to them, out of the heave-offering of the land, most holy, by the border of the Levites.
\v 13 And to the Levites over-against the border of the priests are five and twenty thousand in length, and in breadth ten thousand, all the length is five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
\v 14 And they do not sell of it, nor exchange, nor cause to pass away the first-fruit of the land: for it is holy to Yahweh.
\v 15 And the five thousand that is left in the breadth, on the front of the five and twenty thousand, is common — for the city, for dwelling, and for suburb, and the city had been in its middle.
\v 16 And these are its measures: the north side five hundred, and four thousand, and the south side five hundred, and four thousand, and on the east side five hundred, and four thousand, and the west side five hundred, and four thousand.
\v 17 And the suburb to the city had been northward, fifty and two hundred, and southward, fifty and two hundred, and eastward, fifty and two hundred, and westward, fifty and two hundred.
\v 18 And the residue in length over-against the heave-offering of the holy portion is ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward, and it had been over-against the heave-offering of the holy portion, and its increase had been for food to the servants of the city,
\v 19 even to him who is serving the city, they serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
\v 20 All the heave-offering is five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand, square do you lift up the heave-offering of the holy portion with the possession of the city.
\v 21 And the residue is for the prince, on this side and on that side of the heave-offering of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, on the front of the five and twenty thousand of the heave-offering unto the east border, and westward, on the front of the five and twenty thousand on the west border, over-against the portions of the prince; and the heave-offering of the holy portion, and the sanctuary of the house, had been in its middle.
\v 22 And from the possession of the Levites, from the possession of the city, in the middle of that which is to the prince, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, there is to the prince.
\v 23 'As to the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin one,
\v 24 and by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon one,
\v 25 and by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar one,
\v 26 and by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun one,
\v 27 and by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad one,
\v 28 and by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border had been from Tamar to the waters of Meriboth-Kadesh, the stream by the great sea.
\v 29 This is the land that you separate by inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions — an affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 30 And these are the outgoings of the city on the north side, five hundred, and four thousand measures.
\v 31 And the gates of the city are according to the names of the tribes of Israel; three gates northward: the gate of Reuben one, the gate of Judah one, the gate of Levi one.
\v 32 And on the east side five hundred, and four thousand, and three gates: the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of Dan one.
\v 33 And the south side five hundred, and four thousand measures, and three gates: the gate of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zebulun one.
\v 34 The west side five hundred, and four thousand, their gates three: the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher one, the gate of Naphtali one.
\v 35 Round about is eighteen thousand, and the renown of the city is from the day Yahweh is there.'
