\c 1
\v 1 O the happiness of that one, who Hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked. And in the way of sinners had not stood, And in the seat of scorners had not sat;
\v 2 But — in the law of Yahweh is his delight, And in His law he did meditate by day and by night:
\v 3 And he had been as a tree, Planted by rivulets of water, That gave its fruit in its season, And its leaf did not wither, And all that he did he caused to prosper.
\v 4 Not so the wicked: But — as chaff that wind driveth away!
\v 5 Therefore the wicked rise not in judgment, Nor sinners in the company of the righteous,
\v 6 For Yahweh is knowing the way of the righteous, And the way of the wicked is lost!
\c 2
\v 1 Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?
\v 2 Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have been united together, Against Yahweh, and against His Messiah:
\v 3 'Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick bands.'
\v 4 He who is sitting in the heavens did laugh, The Lord did mock at them.
\v 5 Then did He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath He did trouble them:
\v 6 And I — I have anointed My King, Upon Zion — My holy hill.'
\v 7 I declare concerning a statute: Yahweh said unto me, 'My Son You are, I to-day have brought you forth.
\v 8 Ask of Me and I give nations — your inheritance, And your possession — the ends of earth.
\v 9 You will rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a potter You will crush them.'
\v 10 And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of earth,
\v 11 Serve you Yahweh with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
\v 12 Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And you lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all trusting in Him!
\c 3
\v 1 A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Yahweh, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.
\v 2 Many are saying of my soul, 'There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah.
\v 3 And You, O Yahweh, are a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.
\v 4 My voice is unto Yahweh: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.
\v 5 I — I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Yahweh sustaineth me.
\v 6 I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.
\v 7 Rise, O Yahweh! save me, my God. Because You hast smitten All mine enemies on the cheek. The teeth of the wicked You hast broken.
\v 8 Of Yahweh is this salvation; On Your people is Your blessing! Selah.
\c 4
\v 1 To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. — A Psalm of David. In my calling answer You me, O God of my righteousness. In adversity You gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear my prayer.
\v 2 Sons of men! till when is my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing, you seek a lie. Selah.
\v 3 And know you that Yahweh Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Yahweh heareth in my calling to Him.
\v 4 Tremble you, and do not sin;' Say you thus in your heart on your bed, And be you silent. Selah.
\v 5 Sacrifice you sacrifices of righteousness, And trust you unto Yahweh.
\v 6 Many are saying, 'Who did show us good?' Lift on us the light of Your face, O Yahweh,
\v 7 You hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied.
\v 8 In peace together I lie down and sleep, For You, O Yahweh, alone, In confidence will cause me to dwell!
\c 5
\v 1 To the Overseer, 'Concerning the Inheritances.' — A Psalm of David. My sayings hear, O Yahweh, Consider my meditation.
\v 2 Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.
\v 3 Yahweh, at morning You hearest my voice, At morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out.
\v 4 For not a God desiring wickedness are You, Evil inhabiteth Thee not.
\v 5 The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: You hast hated all working iniquity.
\v 6 You destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and deceit Yahweh did abominate.
\v 7 And I, in the abundance of Your kindness, I enter Your house, I bow myself toward Your holy temple in Your fear.
\v 8 O Yahweh, lead me in Your righteousness, Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Your way,
\v 9 For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart is mischiefs, An open grave is their throat, Their tongue they make smooth.
\v 10 Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.
\v 11 And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing, and You coverest them over, And those loving Your name exult in Thee.
\v 12 For You blessest the righteous, O Yahweh, As a buckler with favour will compass him!
\c 6
\v 1 To the Overseer with stringed instruments, on the octave. — A Psalm of David. O Yahweh, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor in Your fury chastise me.
\v 2 Favour me, O Yahweh, for I am weak, Heal me, O Yahweh, For troubled have been my bones,
\v 3 And my soul had been troubled greatly, And You, O Yahweh, till when?
\v 4 Turn back, O Yahweh, draw out my soul, Save me for Your kindness' sake.
\v 5 For there is not in death Your memorial, In Sheol, who did give thanks to Thee?
\v 6 I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all the night on my bed, With my tear my couch I waste.
\v 7 Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all mine adversaries,
\v 8 Turn from me all you workers of iniquity, For Yahweh heard the voice of my weeping,
\v 9 Yahweh had heard my supplication, Yahweh my prayer receiveth.
\v 10 Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They turn back — ashamed in a moment!
\c 7
\v 1 'The Erring One,' by David, that he sung to Yahweh concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Yahweh, my God, in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.
\v 2 Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no deliverer.
\v 3 O Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,
\v 4 If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary without cause,
\v 5 An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtook, And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.
\v 6 Rise, O Yahweh, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake You for me: Judgment You hast commanded:
\v 7 And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high turn You back,
\v 8 Yahweh did judge the peoples; Judge me, O Yahweh, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity on me,
\v 9 Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And establish You the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.
\v 10 My shield is on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!
\v 11 God is a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all times.
\v 12 If one turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he had trodden — He prepared it,
\v 13 Yea, for him He had prepared Instruments of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He made.
\v 14 Lo, he travaileth with iniquity, And he had conceived perverseness, And had brought forth falsehood.
\v 15 A pit he had prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth into a ditch he made.
\v 16 Return did his perverseness on his head, And on his crown his violence came down.
\v 17 I thank Yahweh, According to His righteousness, And praise the name of Yahweh Most High!
\c 8
\v 1 To the Overseer, 'On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Yahweh, our Lord, How honourable Your name in all the earth! Who settest yours honour on the heavens.
\v 2 From the mouths of infants and sucklings You hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger.
\v 3 For I see Your heavens, a work of Your fingers, Moon and stars that You did establish.
\v 4 What is man that You rememberest him? The son of man that You inspectest him?
\v 5 And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.
\v 6 You will cause him to rule Over the works of Your hands, All You hast placed under his feet.
\v 7 Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,
\v 8 Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!
\v 9 Yahweh, our Lord, How honourable Your name in all the earth!
\c 9
\v 1 To the Overseer, 'On the Death of Labben.' — A Psalm of David. I confess, O Yahweh, with all my heart, I recount all Your wonders,
\v 2 I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Your Name, O Most High.
\v 3 In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish from Your face.
\v 4 For You hast done my judgment and my right. You hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness.
\v 5 You hast rebuked nations, You hast destroyed the wicked, Their name You hast blotted out to the age and for ever.
\v 6 O you Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As to cities you hast plucked up, Perished had their memorial with them.
\v 7 And Yahweh to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment His throne.
\v 8 And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.
\v 9 And Yahweh is a tower for the bruised, A tower for times of adversity.
\v 10 They trust in Thee who do know Your name, For You hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Yahweh.
\v 11 Sing you praise to Yahweh, inhabiting Zion, Declare you among the peoples His acts,
\v 12 For He who is seeking for blood Them had remembered, He had not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.
\v 13 Favour me, O Yahweh, See mine affliction by those hating me, You who liftest me up from the gates of death,
\v 14 So that I recount all Your praise, In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Your salvation.
\v 15 Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In a net that they hid had their foot been captured.
\v 16 Yahweh had been known, Judgment He had done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation. Selah.
\v 17 The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All nations forgetting God.
\v 18 For not for ever is the needy forgotten, The hope of the humble lost to the age.
\v 19 Rise, O Yahweh, let not man be strong, Let nations be judged before Your face.
\v 20 Appoint, O Yahweh, a director to them, Let nations know they are men! Selah.
\c 10
\v 1 Why, Yahweh, will You stand at a distance? You will hide in times of adversity,
\v 2 Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.
\v 3 Because the wicked had boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he had blessed, He had despised Yahweh.
\v 4 The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. 'God is not!' are all his devices.
\v 5 Pain do his ways at all times, On high are Your judgments before him, All his adversaries — he puffeth at them.
\v 6 He had said in his heart, 'I am not moved,' To generation and generation not in evil.
\v 7 Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue is perverseness and iniquity,
\v 8 He did sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he did slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,
\v 9 He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.
\v 10 He is bruised — he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones had the afflicted.
\v 11 He said in his heart, 'God had forgotten, He had hid His face, He had never seen.'
\v 12 Arise, O Yahweh! O God, lift up Your hand! Forget not the humble.
\v 13 Wherefore had the wicked despised God? He had said in his heart, 'It is not required.'
\v 14 You hast seen, For You perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Your hand, On Thee did the afflicted leave it, Of the fatherless You hast been an helper.
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;
\v 16 Yahweh is king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!
\v 17 The desire of the humble You hast heard, O Yahweh. You preparest their heart; You causest Thine ear to attend,
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress — man of the earth!
\c 11
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By David. In Yahweh I trusted, how say you to my soul, 'They moved to Your mountain for the bird?
\v 2 For behold, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
\v 3 When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous — what had he done?
\v 4 Yahweh is in his holy temple: Yahweh — in the heavens is His throne. His eyes see — His eyelids try the sons of men.
\v 5 Yahweh the righteous did try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,
\v 6 He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind is the portion of their cup.
\v 7 For righteous is Yahweh, Righteousness He had loved, The upright did His countenance see!'
\c 12
\v 1 To the Overseer, on the octave. — A Psalm of David. Save, Yahweh, for the saintly had failed, For the stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:
\v 2 Vanity they speak each with his neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.
\v 3 Yahweh did cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue speaking great things,
\v 4 Who said, 'By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?'
\v 5 Because of the spoiling of the poor, Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, said Yahweh, I set in safety him who did breathe for it.
\v 6 Sayings of Yahweh are pure sayings; Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.
\v 7 You, O Yahweh, will preserve them, You keepest us from this generation to the age.
\v 8 Around the wicked walk continually, According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
\c 13
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Till when, O Yahweh, Dost You forget me? — for ever? Till when will You hide Your face from me?
\v 2 Till when do I set counsels in my soul? Sorrow in my heart daily? Till when is mine enemy exalted over me?
\v 3 Look attentively; Answer me, O Yahweh, my God, Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death,
\v 4 Lest mine enemy say, 'I overcame him,' Mine adversaries joy when I am moved.
\v 5 And I, in Your kindness I have trusted, Rejoice did my heart in Your salvation.
\v 6 I do sing to Yahweh, For He had conferred benefits upon me!
\c 14
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By David. A fool had said in his heart, 'God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.
\v 2 Yahweh from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one — seeking God.
\v 3 The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.
\v 4 Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Yahweh they have not called.
\v 5 There they have feared a fear, For God is in the generation of the righteous.
\v 6 The counsel of the poor you cause to stink, Because Yahweh is his refuge.
\v 7 Who did give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Yahweh did turn back To a captivity of His people, Jacob did rejoice — Israel is glad!
\c 15
\v 1 A Psalm of David. Yahweh, who did sojourn in Your tent? Who did dwell in Your holy hill?
\v 2 He who is walking uprightly, And working righteousness, And speaking truth in his heart.
\v 3 He had not slandered by his tongue, He had not done to his friend evil; And reproach he had not lifted up Against his neighbour.
\v 4 Despised in his eyes is a rejected one, And those fearing Yahweh he did honour. He had sworn to suffer evil, and changeth not;
\v 5 His silver he had not given in usury, And a bribe against the innocent Hath not taken; Whoso is doing these is not moved to the age!
\c 16
\v 1 A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee.
\v 2 You hast said to Yahweh, 'My Lord You are;' My good is not for yours own sake;
\v 3 For the holy ones who are in the land, And the honourable, all my delight is in them.
\v 4 Multiplied are their griefs, Who have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips.
\v 5 Yahweh is the portion of my share, and of my cup, You — You will uphold my lot.
\v 6 Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance is for me.
\v 7 I bless Yahweh who had counselled me; Also in the nights my reins instruct me.
\v 8 I did place Yahweh before me continually, Because — at my right hand I am not moved.
\v 9 Therefore had my heart been glad, And my honour did rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:
\v 10 For You will not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest your saintly one to see corruption.
\v 11 You causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys is with Your presence, Pleasant things by Your right hand for ever!
\c 17
\v 1 A Prayer of David. Hear, O Yahweh, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear to my prayer, without lips of deceit.
\v 2 From before you my judgment did go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.
\v 3 You hast proved my heart, You hast inspected by night, You hast tried me, You findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth.
\v 4 As to doings of man, Through a word of Your lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;
\v 5 To uphold my goings in Your paths, My steps have not slidden.
\v 6 I — I called Thee, for You will answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.
\v 7 Separate wonderfully Your kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Your right hand, from withstanders.
\v 8 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Your wings you will hide me.
\v 9 From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.
\v 10 Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:
\v 11 Our steps now have compassed him;' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.
\v 12 His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.
\v 13 Arise, O Yahweh, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Your sword,
\v 14 From men, Your hand, O Yahweh, From men of the world, their portion is in life, And with Your hidden things You fillest their belly, They are satisfied with sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings.
\v 15 I — in righteousness, I see Your face; I am satisfied, in awaking, with Your form!
\c 18
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By a servant of Yahweh, by David, who had spoken to Yahweh the words of this song in the day Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, and he said: — I love Thee, O Yahweh, my strength.
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, and my bulwark, And my deliverer, My God is my rock, I trust in Him: My shield, and a horn of my salvation, My high tower.
\v 3 The 'Praised One' I call Yahweh, And from my enemies I am saved.
\v 4 Compassed me have cords of death, And streams of the worthless make me afraid.
\v 5 Cords of Sheol have surrounded me, Before me have been snares of death.
\v 6 In mine adversity I call Yahweh, And unto my God I cry. He heareth from His temple my voice, And My cry before Him came into His ears.
\v 7 And shake and tremble did the earth, And foundations of hills are troubled, And they shake — because He had wrath.
\v 8 Gone up had smoke by His nostrils, And fire from His mouth consumeth, Coals have been kindled by it.
\v 9 And He inclineth the heavens, and came down, And thick darkness is under His feet.
\v 10 And He rideth on a cherub, and did fly, And He flieth on wings of wind.
\v 11 He made darkness His secret place, Round about Him His tabernacle, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\v 12 From the brightness over-against Him His thick clouds have passed on, Hail and coals of fire.
\v 13 And thunder in the heavens did Yahweh, And the Most High gave forth His voice, Hail and coals of fire.
\v 14 And He sent His arrows and scattereth them, And much lightning, and crusheth them.
\v 15 And seen are the streams of waters, And revealed are foundations of the earth. From Your rebuke, O Yahweh, From the breath of the spirit of Thine anger.
\v 16 He sent from above — He took me, He draweth me out of many waters.
\v 17 He delivereth me from my strong enemy, And from those hating me, For they have been stronger than I.
\v 18 They go before me in a day of my calamity And Yahweh is for a support to me.
\v 19 And He brought me forth to a large place, He draweth me out, because He delighted in me.
\v 20 Yahweh did recompense me According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, He did return to me.
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not done wickedly against my God.
\v 22 For all His judgments are before me, And His statutes I turn not from me.
\v 23 And I am perfect with him, And I keep myself from mine iniquity.
\v 24 And Yahweh did return to me, According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, Over-against his eyes.
\v 25 With the kind You showest Yourself kind, With a perfect man showest Yourself perfect.
\v 26 With the pure You showest Yourself pure, And with the perverse showest Yourself a wrestler,
\v 27 For You a poor people savest, And the eyes of the high causest to fall.
\v 28 For You — You lightest my lamp, Yahweh my God enlighteneth my darkness.
\v 29 For by Thee I run — a troop! And by my God I leap a wall.
\v 30 God! perfect is His way, The saying of Yahweh is tried, A shield is He to all those trusting in Him.
\v 31 For who is God besides Yahweh? And who is a rock save our God?
\v 32 God! who is girding me with strength, And He made perfect my way.
\v 33 Making my feet like hinds, And on my high places caused me to stand.
\v 34 Teaching my hands for battle, And a bow of brass was brought down by my arms.
\v 35 And You givest to me the shield of Your salvation, And Your right hand did support me, And Your lowliness made me great.
\v 36 You enlargest my step under me, And mine ankles have not slidden.
\v 37 I pursue mine enemies, and overtake them, And turn back not till they are consumed.
\v 38 I smite them, and they are not able to rise, They fall under my feet,
\v 39 And You girdest me with strength for battle, Causest my withstanders to bow under me.
\v 40 As to mine enemies — You hast given to me the neck, As to those hating me — I cut them off.
\v 41 They cry, and there is no saviour, On Yahweh, and He did not answer them.
\v 42 And I beat them as dust before wind, As mire of the streets I empty them out.
\v 43 You will deliver me From the strivings of the people, You placest me for a head of nations, A people I have not known do serve me.
\v 44 At the hearing of the ear they hearken to me, Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me,
\v 45 Sons of a stranger fade away, And are killed out of their close places.
\v 46 Yahweh lived — and blessed is my rock, And exalted is the God of my salvation.
\v 47 God — who is giving vengeance to me, And He subdueth peoples under me,
\v 48 My deliverer from mine enemies, Above my withstanders You raisest me, From a man of violence will deliver me.
\v 49 Therefore I confess Thee among nations, O Yahweh, And to Your name I sing praise,
\v 50 Magnifying the salvation of His king, And doing kindness to His anointed, To David, and to his seed — unto the age!
\c 19
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. The heavens are recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse is declaring.
\v 2 Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.
\v 3 There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice had not been heard.
\v 4 Into all the earth had their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,
\v 5 And he, as a bridegroom, went out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.
\v 6 From the end of the heavens is his going out, And his revolution is unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat.
\v 7 The law of Yahweh is perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Yahweh are stedfast, Making wise the simple,
\v 8 The precepts of Yahweh are upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes,
\v 9 The fear of Yahweh is clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Yahweh are true, They have been righteous — together.
\v 10 They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.
\v 11 Also — Your servant is warned by them, 'In keeping them is a great reward.'
\v 12 Errors! who did understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,
\v 13 Also — from presumptuous ones keep back Your servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,
\v 14 Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer!
\c 20
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Yahweh did answer you, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob did set you on high,
\v 2 He did send your help from the sanctuary, And from Zion did support you,
\v 3 He did remember all your presents, And your burnt-offering did reduce to ashes. Selah.
\v 4 He did give to you according to your heart, And all your counsel did fulfil.
\v 5 We sing of your salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Yahweh did fulfil all your requests.
\v 6 Now I have known That Yahweh had saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand.
\v 7 Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Yahweh our God Make mention.
\v 8 They — they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright.
\v 9 O Yahweh, save the king, He did answer us in the day we call!
\c 21
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Yahweh, in Your strength is the king joyful, In Your salvation how greatly he rejoiceth.
\v 2 The desire of his heart You gavest to him, And the request of his lips You hast not withheld. Selah.
\v 3 For You puttest before him blessings of goodness, You settest on his head a crown of fine gold.
\v 4 Life he had asked from Thee, You hast given to him — length of days, Age-during — and for ever.
\v 5 Great is his honour in Your salvation, Honour and majesty You placest on him.
\v 6 For You makest him blessings for ever, You will cause him to rejoice with joy, By Your countenance.
\v 7 For the king is trusting in Yahweh, And in the kindness of the Most High He is not moved.
\v 8 Your hand came to all Thine enemies, Your right hand did find Your haters.
\v 9 You makest them as a furnace of fire, At the time of Your presence. Yahweh in His anger did swallow them, And fire did devour them.
\v 10 Their fruit from earth You destroyest, And their seed from the sons of men.
\v 11 For they stretched out against Thee evil, They devised a wicked device, they prevail not,
\v 12 For You makest them a butt, When Your strings You preparest against their faces.
\v 13 Be You exalted, O Yahweh in, Your strength, We sing and we praise Your might!
\c 22
\v 1 To the Overseer, on 'The Hind of the Morning.' — A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast You forsaken me? Far from my salvation, The words of my roaring?
\v 2 My God, I call by day, and You answerest not, And by night, and there is no silence to me.
\v 3 And You are holy, Sitting — the Praise of Israel.
\v 4 In Thee did our fathers trust — they trusted, And You will deliver them.
\v 5 Unto Thee they cried, and were delivered, In Thee they trusted, and were not ashamed.
\v 6 And I am a worm, and no man, A reproach of man, and despised of the people.
\v 7 All beholding me do mock at me, They make free with the lip — shake the head,
\v 8 'Roll unto Yahweh, He did deliver him, He did deliver him, for he delighted in him.'
\v 9 For you are He bringing me forth from the womb, Causing me to trust, On the breasts of my mother.
\v 10 On Thee I have been cast from the womb, From the belly of my mother You are my God.
\v 11 Be not far from me, For adversity is near, for there is no helper.
\v 12 Many bulls have surrounded me, Mighty ones of Bashan have compassed me,
\v 13 They have opened against me their mouth, A lion tearing and roaring.
\v 14 As waters I have been poured out, And separated themselves have all my bones, My heart had been like wax, It is melted in the middle of my bowels.
\v 15 Dried up as an earthen vessel is my power, And my tongue is cleaving to my jaws.
\v 16 And to the dust of death you appointest me, For surrounded me have dogs, A company of evil doers have compassed me, Piercing my hands and my feet.
\v 17 I count all my bones — they look expectingly, They look upon me,
\v 18 They apportion my garments to themselves, And for my clothing they cause a lot to fall.
\v 19 And You, O Yahweh, be not far off, O my strength, to help me haste.
\v 20 Deliver from the sword my soul, From the paw of a dog mine only one.
\v 21 Save me from the mouth of a lion: — And — from the horns of the high places You hast answered me!
\v 22 I declare Your name to my brethren, In the middle of the assembly I praise Thee.
\v 23 Ye who fear Yahweh, praise you Him, All the seed of Jacob, honour you Him, And be afraid of Him, all you seed of Israel.
\v 24 For He had not despised, nor abominated, The affliction of the afflicted, Nor had He hidden His face from him, And in his crying unto Him He heareth.
\v 25 Of Thee my praise is in the great assembly. My vows I complete before His fearers.
\v 26 The humble do eat and are satisfied, Praise Yahweh do those seeking Him, Your heart did live for ever.
\v 27 Remember and return unto Yahweh, Do all ends of the earth, And before Thee bow themselves, Do all families of the nations,
\v 28 For to Yahweh is the kingdom, And He is ruling among nations.
\v 29 And the fat ones of earth have eaten, And they bow themselves, Before Him bow do all going down to dust, And he who had not revived his soul.
\v 30 A seed did serve Him, It is declared of the Lord to the generation.
\v 31 They come and declare His righteousness, To a people that is borne, that He had made!
\c 23
\v 1 A Psalm of David. Yahweh is my shepherd, I do not lack,
\v 2 In pastures of tender grass He caused me to lie down, By quiet waters He did lead me.
\v 3 My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,
\v 4 Also — when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for You are with me, Your rod and Your staff — they comfort me.
\v 5 You arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, You hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!
\v 6 Only — goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling is in the house of Yahweh, For a length of days!
\c 24
\v 1 A Psalm of David. To Yahweh is the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
\v 2 For He on the seas had founded it, And on the floods He did establish it.
\v 3 Who went up into the hill of Yahweh? And who riseth up in His holy place?
\v 4 The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who had not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor had sworn to deceit.
\v 5 He beareth away a blessing from Yahweh, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.
\v 6 This is a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Your face, O Jacob! Selah.
\v 7 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in did the king of glory!
\v 8 Who is this — 'the king of glory?' Yahweh — strong and mighty, Yahweh, the mighty in battle.
\v 9 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in did the king of glory!
\v 10 Who is He — this 'king of glory?' Yahweh of hosts — He is the king of glory! Selah.
\c 25
\v 1 By David. Unto Thee, O Yahweh, my soul I lift up.
\v 2 My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.
\v 3 Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed, Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.
\v 4 Your ways, O Yahweh, cause me to know, Your paths teach You me.
\v 5 Cause me to tread in Your truth, and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited all the day.
\v 6 Remember Your mercies, O Yahweh, And Your kindnesses, for from the age are they.
\v 7 Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, Do not You remember. According to Your kindness be mindful of me, For Your goodness' sake, O Yahweh.
\v 8 Good and upright is Yahweh, Therefore He directeth sinners in the way.
\v 9 He caused the humble to tread in judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.
\v 10 All the paths of Yahweh are kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies.
\v 11 For Your name's sake, O Yahweh, You hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it is great.
\v 12 Who is this — the man fearing Yahweh? He directeth him in the way He did choose.
\v 13 His soul in good did remain, And his seed did possess the land.
\v 14 The secret of Yahweh is for those fearing Him, And His covenant — to cause them to know.
\v 15 Mine eyes are continually unto Yahweh, For He brought out from a net my feet.
\v 16 Turn You unto me, and favour me, For lonely and afflicted am I.
\v 17 The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.
\v 18 See mine affliction and my misery, And bear with all my sins.
\v 19 See my enemies, for they have been many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.
\v 20 Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.
\v 21 Integrity and uprightness do keep me, For I have waited on Thee.
\v 22 Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
\c 26
\v 1 By David. Judge me, O Yahweh, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Yahweh I have trusted, I slide not.
\v 2 Try me, O Yahweh, and prove me, Purified are my reins and my heart.
\v 3 For Your kindness is before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Your truth.
\v 4 I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.
\v 5 I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.
\v 6 I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Yahweh.
\v 7 To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Your wonders.
\v 8 Yahweh, I have loved the habitation of Your house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.
\v 9 Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,
\v 10 In whose hand is a wicked device, And their right hand is full of bribes.
\v 11 And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.
\v 12 My foot had stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Yahweh!
\c 27
\v 1 By David. Yahweh is my light and my salvation, Whom do I fear? Yahweh is the strength of my life, Of whom am I afraid?
\v 2 When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and fallen.
\v 3 Yough a host did encamp against me, My heart did not fear, Yough war riseth up against me, In this I am confident.
\v 4 One thing I asked of Yahweh — it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Yahweh, All the days of my life, To look on the pleasantness of Yahweh, And to inquire in His temple.
\v 5 For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth me up.
\v 6 And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies — my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Yahweh.
\v 7 Hear, O Yahweh, my voice — I call, And favour me, and answer me.
\v 8 To Thee said my heart 'They sought my face, Your face, O Yahweh, I seek.'
\v 9 Hide not Your face from me, Turn not aside in anger Your servant, My help You hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
\v 10 When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then did Yahweh gather me.
\v 11 Shew me, O Yahweh, Your way, And lead me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.
\v 12 Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence to me.
\v 13 I had not believed to look on the goodness of Yahweh In the land of the living!
\v 14 Look unto Yahweh — be strong, And He did strengthen your heart, Yea, look unto Yahweh!
\c 28
\v 1 By David. Unto Thee, O Yahweh, I call, My rock, be not silent to me! Lest You be silent to me, And I have been compared With those going down to the pit.
\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee, In my lifting up my hands toward your holy oracle.
\v 3 Draw me not with the wicked, And with workers of iniquity, Speaking peace with their neighbours, And evil in their heart.
\v 4 Give to them according to their acting, And according to the evil of their doings. According to the work of their hands give to them. Return their deed to them.
\v 5 For they attend not to the doing of Yahweh, And unto the work of His hands. He throweth them down, And did not build them up.
\v 6 Blessed is Yahweh, For He had heard the voice of my supplications.
\v 7 Yahweh is my strength, and my shield, In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exulteth, And with my song I thank Him.
\v 8 Yahweh is strength to him, Yea, the strength of the salvation of His anointed is He.
\v 9 Save Your people, and bless Thine inheritance, And feed them, and carry them to the age!
\c 29
\v 1 A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Yahweh honour and strength.
\v 2 Ascribe to Yahweh the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Yahweh, In the beauty of holiness.
\v 3 The voice of Yahweh is on the waters, The God of glory had thundered, Yahweh is on many waters.
\v 4 The voice of Yahweh is with power, The voice of Yahweh is with majesty,
\v 5 The voice of Yahweh is shivering cedars, Yea, Yahweh shivers the cedars of Lebanon.
\v 6 And He caused them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,
\v 7 The voice of Yahweh is hewing fiery flames,
\v 8 The voice of Yahweh paineth a wilderness, Yahweh paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.
\v 9 The voice of Yahweh paineth the oaks, And made bare the forests, And in His temple every one said, 'Glory.'
\v 10 Yahweh on the deluge had sat, And Yahweh sitteth king — to the age,
\v 11 Yahweh strength to his people gave, Yahweh blessed His people with peace!
\c 30
\v 1 A Psalm. — A song of the dedication of the house of David. I exalt Thee, O Yahweh, For You hast drawn me up, and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me.
\v 2 Yahweh my God, I have cried to Thee, And You will heal me.
\v 3 Yahweh, You hast brought up from Sheol my soul, You hast kept me alive, From going down to the pit.
\v 4 Sing praise to Yahweh, you His saints, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,
\v 5 For — a moment is in His anger, Life is in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing.
\v 6 And I — I have said in mine ease, 'I am not moved — to the age.
\v 7 O Yahweh, in Your good pleasure, You hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,' You hast hidden Your face — I have been troubled.
\v 8 Unto Thee, O Yahweh, I call, And unto Yahweh I make supplication.
\v 9 What gain is in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? did it declare Your truth?
\v 10 Hear, O Yahweh, and favour me, O Yahweh, be a helper to me.'
\v 11 You hast turned my mourning to dancing for me, You hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me with joy.
\v 12 So that honour did praise Thee, and is not silent, O Yahweh, my God, to the age I thank Thee!
\c 31
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. In Thee, O Yahweh, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age, In Your righteousness deliver me.
\v 2 Incline unto me Thine ear hastily, deliver me, Be to me for a strong rock, For a house of bulwarks to save me.
\v 3 For my rock and my bulwark are You, For Your name's sake lead me and tend me.
\v 4 Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, For You are my strength.
\v 5 Into Your hand I commit my spirit, You hast redeemed me, Yahweh God of truth.
\v 6 I have hated the observers of lying vanities, And I toward Yahweh have been confident.
\v 7 I rejoice, and am glad in Your kindness, In that You hast seen mine affliction, You hast known in adversities my soul.
\v 8 And You hast not shut me up, Into the hand of an enemy, You hast caused my feet to stand in a broad place.
\v 9 Favour me, O Yahweh, for distress is to me, Mine eye, my soul, and my body Have become old by provocation.
\v 10 For my life had been consumed in sorrow And my years in sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity had been my strength, And my bones have become old.
\v 11 Among all mine adversaries I have been a reproach, And to my neighbours exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintances, Those seeing me without — fled from me.
\v 12 I have been forgotten as dead out of mind, I have been as a perishing vessel.
\v 13 For I have heard an evil account of many, Fear is round about. In their being united against me, To take my life they have devised,
\v 14 And I on Thee — I have trusted, O Yahweh, I have said, 'You are my God.'
\v 15 In Your hand are my times, Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from my pursuers.
\v 16 Cause Your face to shine on Your servant, Save me in Your kindness.
\v 17 O Yahweh, let me not be ashamed, For I have called Thee, let the wicked be ashamed, Let them become silent to Sheol.
\v 18 Let lips of falsehood become dumb, That are speaking against the righteous, Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.
\v 19 How abundant is Your goodness, That You hast laid up for those fearing Thee,
\v 20 You hast wrought for those trusting in Thee, Before sons of men. You hidest them in the secret place of Your presence, From artifices of man, You concealest them in a tabernacle, From the strife of tongues.
\v 21 Blessed is Yahweh, For He had made marvellous His kindness To me in a city of bulwarks.
\v 22 And I — I have said in my haste, 'I have been cut off from before Thine eyes,' But You hast heard the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee.
\v 23 Love Yahweh, all you His saints, Yahweh is keeping the faithful, And recompensing abundantly a proud doer.
\v 24 Be strong, and He strengtheneth your heart, All you who are waiting for Yahweh!
\c 32
\v 1 By David. — An Instruction. O the happiness of him whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
\v 2 O the happiness of a man, To whom Yahweh imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
\v 3 When I have kept silence, become old have my bones, Through my roaring all the day.
\v 4 When by day and by night Your hand is heavy upon me, My moisture had been changed Into the droughts of summer. Selah.
\v 5 My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine iniquity I have not covered. I have said, 'I confess concerning My transgressions to Yahweh,' And You — You hast taken away, The iniquity of my sin. Selah.
\v 6 For this did every saintly one pray to Thee, As the time to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto him they come not.
\v 7 You are a hiding-place for me, From distress You will keep me, With songs of deliverance will compass me. Selah.
\v 8 I cause you to act wisely, And direct you in the way that you goest, I cause mine eye to take counsel concerning you.
\v 9 Be you not as a horse — as a mule, Without understanding, With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, Not to come near unto you.
\v 10 Many are the pains of the wicked; As to him who is trusting in Yahweh, Kindness did compass him.
\v 11 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous, And sing, all you upright of heart!
\c 33
\v 1 Sing, you righteous, in Yahweh, For upright ones praise is comely.
\v 2 Give you thanks to Yahweh with a harp, With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,
\v 3 Sing you to Him a new song, Play skilfully with shouting.
\v 4 For upright is the word of Yahweh, And all His work is in faithfulness.
\v 5 Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the kindness of Yahweh is the earth full.
\v 6 By the word of Yahweh The heavens have been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.
\v 7 Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.
\v 8 Afraid of Yahweh are all the earth, Of Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.
\v 9 For He had said, and it is, He had commanded, and it standeth.
\v 10 Yahweh made void the counsel of nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.
\v 11 The counsel of Yahweh to the age standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.
\v 12 O the happiness of the nation whose God is Yahweh, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him.
\v 13 From the heavens had Yahweh looked, He had seen all the sons of men.
\v 14 From the fixed place of His dwelling, He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;
\v 15 Who is forming their hearts together, Who is attending unto all their works.
\v 16 The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.
\v 17 A false thing is the horse for safety, And by the abundance of his strength He did not deliver.
\v 18 Lo, the eye of Yahweh is to those fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness,
\v 19 To deliver from death their soul, And to keep them alive in famine.
\v 20 Our soul had waited for Yahweh, Our help and our shield is He,
\v 21 For in Him did our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted.
\v 22 Let Your kindness, O Yahweh, be upon us, As we have waited for Thee!
\c 34
\v 1 By David, in his changing his behaviour before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he went. I do bless Yahweh at all times, Continually His praise is in my mouth.
\v 2 In Yahweh did my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.
\v 3 Ascribe you greatness to Yahweh with me, And we exalt His name together.
\v 4 I sought Yahweh, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.
\v 5 They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.
\v 6 This poor one called, and Yahweh heard, And from all his distresses saved him.
\v 7 A messenger of Yahweh is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.
\v 8 Taste you and see that Yahweh is good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.
\v 9 Fear Yahweh, you His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.
\v 10 Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Yahweh lack not any good,
\v 11 Come you, children, hearken to me, The fear of Yahweh I do teach you.
\v 12 Who is the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?
\v 13 Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.
\v 14 Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.
\v 15 The eyes of Yahweh are unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.
\v 16 (The face of Yahweh is on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)
\v 17 They cried, and Yahweh heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.
\v 18 Near is Yahweh to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.
\v 19 Many are the evils of the righteous, Out of them all did Yahweh deliver him.
\v 20 He is keeping all his bones, One of them had not been broken.
\v 21 Evil did put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.
\v 22 Yahweh redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!
\c 35
\v 1 By David. Strive, Yahweh, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,
\v 3 And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, 'Your salvation I am.'
\v 4 They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.
\v 5 They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Yahweh driving away.
\v 6 Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of Yahweh their pursuer.
\v 7 For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.
\v 8 Meet him did desolation — he knoweth not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.
\v 9 And my soul is joyful in Yahweh, It rejoiceth in His salvation.
\v 10 All my bones say, 'Yahweh, who is like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from his plunderer.'
\v 11 Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known they ask me.
\v 12 They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,
\v 13 And I — in their sickness my clothing is sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom returneth.
\v 14 As if a friend, as if my brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.
\v 15 And — in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;
\v 16 With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me their teeth.
\v 17 Lord, how long will you behold? Keep back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.
\v 18 I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I praise Thee.
\v 19 Mine enemies rejoice not over me with falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.
\v 20 For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,
\v 21 And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, 'Aha, aha, our eye had seen.'
\v 22 You hast seen, O Yahweh, Be not silent, O Lord — be not far from me,
\v 23 Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea.
\v 24 Judge me according to Your righteousness, O Yahweh my God, And they do not rejoice over me.
\v 25 They do not say in their heart, 'Aha, our desire.' They do not say, 'We swallowed him up.'
\v 26 They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me.
\v 27 They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, 'Yahweh is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.'
\v 28 And my tongue uttereth Your righteousness, All the day Your praise!
\c 36
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By a servant of Yahweh, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, 'Fear of God is not before his eyes,
\v 2 For he made it smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.
\v 3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently — to do good.
\v 4 Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he did not refuse.'
\v 5 O Yahweh, in the heavens is Your kindness, Your faithfulness is unto the clouds.
\v 6 Your righteousness is as mountains of God, Your judgments are a great deep. Man and beast You savest, O Yahweh.
\v 7 How precious is Your kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Your wings do trust.
\v 8 They are filled from the fatness of Your house, And the stream of Your delights You will cause them to drink.
\v 9 For with Thee is a fountain of life, In Your light we see light.
\v 10 Draw out Your kindness to those knowing Thee, And Your righteousness to the upright of heart.
\v 11 Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.
\v 12 There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!
\c 37
\v 1 By David. Do not fret because of evil doers, Be not envious against doers of iniquity,
\v 2 For as grass speedily they are cut off, And as the greenness of the tender grass do fade.
\v 3 Trust in Yahweh, and do good, Dwell in the land, and enjoy faithfulness,
\v 4 And delight thyself on Yahweh, And He gave to you the petitions of your heart.
\v 5 Roll on Yahweh your way, And trust upon Him, and He worketh,
\v 6 And had brought out as light your righteousness, And your judgment as noon-day.
\v 7 Be silent for Yahweh, and stay thyself for Him, Do not fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way, Because of a man doing wicked devices.
\v 8 Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret not thyself only to do evil.
\v 9 For evil doers are cut off, As to those waiting on Yahweh, they possess the land.
\v 10 And yet a little, and the wicked is not, And you hast considered his place, and it is not.
\v 11 And the humble do possess the land, And they have delighted themselves In the abundance of peace.
\v 12 The wicked is devising against the righteous, And gnashing against him his teeth.
\v 13 The Lord did laugh at him, For He had seen that his day came.
\v 14 A sword have the wicked opened, And they have trodden their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To slaughter the upright of the way.
\v 15 Their sword did enter into their own heart, And their bows are shivered.
\v 16 Better is the little of the righteous, Than the store of many wicked.
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked are shivered, And Yahweh is sustaining the righteous.
\v 18 Yahweh knoweth the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is — to the age.
\v 19 They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in days of famine they are satisfied.
\v 20 But the wicked perish, and the enemies of Yahweh, As the preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke they have been consumed.
\v 21 The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not, And the righteous is gracious and giving.
\v 22 For His blessed ones do possess the land, And His reviled ones are cut off.
\v 23 From Yahweh are the steps of a man, They have been prepared, And his way he desireth.
\v 24 When he falleth, he is not cast down, For Yahweh is sustaining his hand.
\v 25 Young I have been, I have also become old, And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking bread.
\v 26 All the day he is gracious and lending, And his seed is for a blessing.
\v 27 Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell to the age.
\v 28 For Yahweh is loving judgment, And He did not forsake His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And the seed of the wicked is cut off.
\v 29 The righteous possess the land, And they dwell for ever on it.
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue spoke judgment.
\v 31 The law of his God is his heart, His steps do not slide.
\v 32 The wicked is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to put him to death.
\v 33 Yahweh did not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him in his being judged.
\v 34 Look unto Yahweh, and keep His way, And He did exalt you to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off — you seest!
\v 35 I have seen the wicked terrible, And spreading as a green native plant,
\v 36 And he passeth away, and behold, he is not, And I seek him, and he is not found!
\v 37 Observe the perfect, and see the upright, For the latter end of each is peace.
\v 38 And transgressors were destroyed together, The latter end of the wicked was cut off.
\v 39 And the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh, Their strong place in a time of adversity.
\v 40 And Yahweh did help them and deliver them, He delivereth them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they trusted in Him!
\c 38
\v 1 A Psalm of David, 'To cause to remember.' Yahweh, in Your wrath reprove me not, Nor in Your fury chastise me.
\v 2 For Thine arrows have come down on me, And You lettest down upon me Your hand.
\v 3 Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of Thine indignation, Peace is not in my bones because of my sin.
\v 4 For mine iniquities have passed over my head, As a heavy burden — too heavy for me.
\v 5 Stunk — become corrupt have my wounds, Because of my folly.
\v 6 I have been bent down, I have been bowed down — unto excess, All the day I have gone mourning.
\v 7 For my flanks have been full of drought, And soundness is not in my flesh.
\v 8 I have been feeble and smitten — unto excess, I have roared from disquietude of heart.
\v 9 Lord, before Thee is all my desire, And my sighing from Thee had not been hid.
\v 10 My heart is panting, my power had forsaken me, And the light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me.
\v 11 My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood.
\v 12 And those seeking my soul lay a snare, And those seeking my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do deceits meditate all the day.
\v 13 And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb one who opened not his mouth.
\v 14 Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And in his mouth are no reproofs.
\v 15 Because for Thee, O Yahweh, I have waited, You will answer, O Lord my God.
\v 16 When I said, 'Lest they rejoice over me, In the slipping of my foot against me they magnified themselves.
\v 17 For I am ready to halt, And my pain is before me continually.
\v 18 For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry for my sin.
\v 19 And mine enemies are lively, They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, Have been multiplied.
\v 20 And those paying evil for good accuse me, Because of my pursuing good.
\v 21 Do not forsake me, O Yahweh, My God, be not far from me,
\v 22 Haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
\c 39
\v 1 To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. — A Psalm of David. I have said, 'I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked is before me.'
\v 2 I was dumb with silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.
\v 3 Hot is my heart within me, In my meditating did the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue.
\v 4 Cause me to know, O Yahweh, mine end, And the measure of my days — what it is,' I know how frail I am.
\v 5 Lo, handbreadths You hast made my days, And mine age is as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity is every man set up. Selah.
\v 6 Only, in an image did each walk habitually, Only, in vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them.
\v 7 And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope — it is of Thee.
\v 8 From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not.
\v 9 I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because You — You hast done it.
\v 10 Turn aside from off me Your stroke, From the striving of Your hand I have been consumed.
\v 11 With reproofs against iniquity, You hast corrected man, And will waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity is every man. Selah.
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, And to my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I am with Thee, A settler like all my fathers.
\v 13 Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!
\c 40
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. I have diligently expected Yahweh, And He inclineth to me, and heareth my cry,
\v 2 And He did cause me to come up From a pit of desolation — from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my feet, He is establishing my steps.
\v 3 And He putteth in my mouth a new song, 'Praise to our God.' Many do see and fear, and trust in Yahweh.
\v 4 O the happiness of the man Who had made Yahweh his trust, And had not turned unto the proud, And those turning aside to lies.
\v 5 Much hast You done, Yahweh my God; Your wonders and Your thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee, I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.
\v 6 Sacrifice and present You hast not desired, Ears You hast prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering You hast not asked.
\v 7 Then said I, 'Lo, I have come,' In the roll of the book it is written of me,
\v 8 To do Your pleasure, my God, I have delighted, And Your law is within my heart.
\v 9 I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness In the great assembly, behold, my lips I restrain not, O Yahweh, You hast known.
\v 10 Your righteousness I have not concealed In the middle of my heart, Your faithfulness and Your salvation I have told, I have not hidden Your kindness and Your truth, To the great assembly.
\v 11 You, O Yahweh, restrainest not Your mercies from me, Your kindness and Your truth do continually keep me.
\v 12 For compassed me have evils innumerable, Overtaken me have mine iniquities, And I have not been able to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, And my heart had forsaken me.
\v 13 Be pleased, O Yahweh, to deliver me, O Yahweh, for my help make haste.
\v 14 They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, They are turned backward, And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil.
\v 15 They are desolate because of their shame, Who are saying to me, 'Aha, aha.'
\v 16 All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad in Thee, Those loving Your salvation say continually, 'Yahweh is magnified.'
\v 17 And I am poor and needy, The Lord did devise for me. My help and my deliverer are You, O my God, tarry You not.
\c 41
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of evil did Yahweh deliver him.
\v 2 Yahweh did preserve him and revive him, He is happy in the land, And You givest him not into the will of his enemies.
\v 3 Yahweh supporteth on a couch of sickness, All his bed You hast turned in his weakness.
\v 4 I — I said, 'O Yahweh, favour me, Heal my soul, for I did sin against Thee,'
\v 5 Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth — his name had perished!
\v 6 And if he came to see — vanity he spoke, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He went out — at the street he spoke.
\v 7 All hating me whisper together against me, Against me they devise evil to me:
\v 8 A thing of Belial is poured out on him, And because he lay down he riseth not again.
\v 9 Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One eating my bread, made great the heel against me,
\v 10 And You, Yahweh, favour me, And cause me to rise, And I give recompence to them.
\v 11 By this I have known, That You hast delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me.
\v 12 As to me, in mine integrity, You hast taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age.
\v 13 Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, From the age — and unto the age. Amen and Amen.
\c 42
\v 1 To the Overseer. — An Instruction. By sons of Korah. As a hart did pant for streams of water, So my soul panteth toward Thee, O God.
\v 2 My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, When do I enter and see the face of God?
\v 3 My tear had been to me bread day and night, In their saying unto me all the day, 'Where is your God?'
\v 4 These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, For I pass over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house of God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude keeping feast!
\v 5 What! bowest you thyself, O my soul? Yea, are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him: The salvation of my countenance — My God!
\v 6 In me did my soul bow itself, Therefore I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
\v 7 Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Your water-spouts, All Your breakers and Your billows passed over me.
\v 8 By day Yahweh commandeth His kindness, And by night a song is with me, A prayer to the God of my life.
\v 9 I say to God my rock, 'Why hast You forgotten me? Why go I mourning in the oppression of an enemy?
\v 10 With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached me, In their saying unto me all the day, 'Where is your God?'
\v 11 What! bowest you thyself, O my soul? And what! are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
\c 43
\v 1 Judge me, O God, And plead my cause against a nation not pious, From a man of deceit and perverseness You will deliver me,
\v 2 For you are the God of my strength. Why hast You cast me off? Why mourning do I go up and down, In the oppression of an enemy?
\v 3 Send forth Your light and Your truth, They — they lead me, they bring me in, Unto Your holy hill, and unto Your tabernacles.
\v 4 And I go in unto the altar of God, Unto God, the joy of my rejoicing. And I thank Thee with a harp, O God, my God.
\v 5 What! bowest you thyself, O my soul? And what! are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
\c 44
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. An Instruction. O God, with our ears we have heard, Our fathers have recounted to us, The work You did work in their days, In the days of old.
\v 2 You, with Your hand, nations hast dispossessed. And You will plant them. You afflictest peoples, and sendest them away.
\v 3 For, not by their sword Possessed they the land, And their arm gave not salvation to them, But Your right hand, and Thine arm, And the light of Your countenance, Because You hadst accepted them.
\v 4 You are He, my king, O God, Command the deliverances of Jacob.
\v 5 By Thee our adversaries we do push, By Your name tread down our withstanders,
\v 6 For, not in my bow do I trust, And my sword did not save me.
\v 7 For You hast saved us from our adversaries, And those hating us You hast put to shame.
\v 8 In God we have boasted all the day, And Your name to the age we thank. Selah.
\v 9 In anger You hast cast off and causest us to blush, And goest not forth with our hosts.
\v 10 You causest us to turn backward from an adversary, And those hating us, Have spoiled for themselves.
\v 11 You makest us food like sheep, And among nations You hast scattered us.
\v 12 You sellest Your people — without wealth, And hast not become great by their price.
\v 13 You makest us a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders.
\v 14 You makest us a simile among nations, A shaking of the head among peoples.
\v 15 All the day my confusion is before me, And the shame of my face had covered me.
\v 16 Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler, Because of an enemy and a self-avenger.
\v 17 All this met us, and we did not forget Thee, Nor have we dealt falsely in Your covenant.
\v 18 We turn not backward our heart, Nor turn aside did our step from Your path.
\v 19 But You hast smitten us in a place of dragons, And will cover us over with death-shade.
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, And spread our hands to a strange God,
\v 21 Doth not God search out this? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.
\v 22 Surely, for Your sake we have been killed all the day, Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter.
\v 23 Stir up — why will You sleep, O Lord? Awake, cast us not off for ever.
\v 24 Why Your face hidest You? You forgettest our afflictions and our oppression,
\v 25 For bowed to the dust had our soul, Cleaved to the earth had our belly.
\v 26 Arise, a help to us, And ransom us for your kindness' sake.
\c 45
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies.' — By sons of Korah. — An Instruction. — A song of loves. My heart had indited a good thing, I am telling my works to a king, My tongue is the pen of a speedy writer.
\v 2 You hast been beautified above the sons of men, Grace had been poured into your lips, Therefore had God blessed you to the age.
\v 3 Gird Your sword upon the thigh, O mighty, Your glory and Your majesty!
\v 4 As to Your majesty — prosper! — ride! Because of truth, and meekness — righteousness, And Your right hand showeth Thee fearful things.
\v 5 Thine arrows are sharp, — Peoples fall under Thee — In the heart of the enemies of the king.
\v 6 Your throne, O God, is age-during, and for ever, A sceptre of uprightness Is the sceptre of Your kingdom.
\v 7 You hast loved righteousness and hatest wickedness, Therefore God, your God, had anointed you, Oil of joy above your companions.
\v 8 Myrrh and aloes, cassia! all your garments, Out of palaces of ivory Stringed instruments have made you glad.
\v 9 Daughters of kings are among your precious ones, A queen had stood at your right hand, In pure gold of Ophir.
\v 10 Hearken, O daughter, and see, incline yours ear, And forget your people, and your father's house,
\v 11 And the king did desire your beauty, Because he is your lord — bow thyself to him,
\v 12 And the daughter of Tyre with a present, The rich of the people do appease your face.
\v 13 All glory is the daughter of the king within, Of gold-embroidered work is her clothing.
\v 14 In divers colours she is brought to the king, Virgins — after her — her companions, Are brought to you.
\v 15 They are brought with joy and gladness, They come into the palace of the king.
\v 16 Instead of your fathers are your sons, You will appoint them for princes in all the earth.
\v 17 I make mention of Your name in all generations, Therefore do peoples praise Thee, To the age, and for ever!
\c 46
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. 'For the Virgins.' — A song. God is to us a refuge and strength, A help in adversities found most surely.
\v 2 Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth, And in the slipping of mountains Into the heart of the seas.
\v 3 Roar — troubled are its waters, Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.
\v 4 A river — its rivulets rejoice the city of God, Your holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
\v 5 God is in her middle — she is not moved, God did help her at the turn of the morn!
\v 6 Troubled have been nations, Moved have been kingdoms, He had given forth with His voice, earth melteth.
\v 7 Yahweh of Hosts is with us, A tower for us is the God of Jacob. Selah.
\v 8 Come you, see the works of Yahweh, Who had done astonishing things in the earth,
\v 9 Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He had cut asunder, Chariots he did burn with fire.
\v 10 Desist, and know that I am God, I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth.
\v 11 Yahweh of hosts is with us, A tower for us is the God of Jacob! Selah.
\c 47
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All you peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,
\v 2 For Yahweh Most High is fearful, A great king over all the earth.
\v 3 He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
\v 4 He did choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.
\v 5 God had gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
\v 6 Praise God — praise — give praise to our king, praise.
\v 7 For king of all the earth is God, Give praise, O understanding one.
\v 8 God had reigned over nations, God had sat on His holy throne,
\v 9 Nobles of peoples have been gathered, With the people of the God of Abraham, For to God are the shields of earth, Greatly had He been exalted!
\c 48
\v 1 A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah. Great is Yahweh, and praised greatly, In the city of our God — His holy hill.
\v 2 Beautiful for elevation, A joy of all the land, is Mount Zion, The sides of the north, the city of a great king.
\v 3 God in her high places is known for a tower.
\v 4 For, behold, the kings met, they passed by together,
\v 5 They have seen — so they have marvelled, They have been troubled, they were hastened away.
\v 6 Trembling had seized them there, Pain, as of a travailing woman.
\v 7 By an east wind You shiverest ships of Tarshish.
\v 8 As we have heard, so we have seen, In the city of Yahweh of hosts, In the city of our God, God did establish her — to the age. Selah.
\v 9 We have thought, O God, of Your kindness, In the middle of Your temple,
\v 10 As is Your name, O God, so is Your praise, Over the ends of the earth, Righteousness had filled Your right hand.
\v 11 Rejoice did Mount Zion, The daughters of Judah are joyful, For the sake of Your judgments.
\v 12 Compass Zion, and go round her, count her towers,
\v 13 Set your heart to her bulwark, Consider her high places, So that you recount to a later generation,
\v 14 That this God is our God — To the age and for ever, He — he did lead us over death!
\c 49
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Hear this, all you peoples, Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world.
\v 2 Both low and high, together rich and needy.
\v 3 My mouth spoke wise things, And the meditations of my heart are things of understanding.
\v 4 I incline to a simile mine ear, I open with a harp my riddle:
\v 5 Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters did compass me.
\v 6 Those trusting on their wealth, And in the multitude of their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.
\v 7 A brother did no one at all ransom, He did not give to God his atonement.
\v 8 And precious is the redemption of their soul, And it had ceased — to the age.
\v 9 And still he lived for ever, He saw not the pit.
\v 10 For he saw wise men die, Together the foolish and brutish perish, And have left to others their wealth.
\v 11 Their heart is: Their houses are to the age, Their tabernacles to all generations. They proclaimed their names over the lands.
\v 12 And man in honour did not remain, He had been like the beasts, they have been cut off.
\v 13 This their way is folly for them, And their posterity with their sayings are pleased. Selah.
\v 14 As sheep for Sheol they have set themselves, Death did afflict them, And the upright rule over them in the morning, And their form is for consumption. Sheol is a dwelling for him.
\v 15 Only, God did ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol, For He did receive me. Selah.
\v 16 Fear not, when one made wealth, When the honour of his house is abundant,
\v 17 For at his death he receiveth nothing, His honour went not down after him.
\v 18 For his soul in his life he blessed, (And they praise you when you will well for thyself.)
\v 19 It came to the generation of his fathers, For ever they see not the light.
\v 20 Man in honour, who understandest not, Hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off!
\c 50
\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods — Yahweh — had spoken, And He called to the earth From the rising of the sun unto its going in.
\v 2 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.
\v 3 Our God came, and is not silent, Fire before Him did devour, And round about him it had been very tempestuous.
\v 4 He did call unto the heavens from above, And unto the earth, to judge His people.
\v 5 Gather you to Me My saints, Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.
\v 6 And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is judge. Selah.
\v 7 Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel, and I testify against you, God, your God am I.
\v 8 Not for your sacrifices do I reprove you, Yea, your burnt-offerings Are before Me continually.
\v 9 I take not from your house a bullock, From your folds he goats.
\v 10 For Mine is every beast of the forest, The cattle on the hills of oxen.
\v 11 I have known every fowl of the mountains, And the wild beast of the field is with Me.
\v 12 If I am hungry I tell not to you, For Mine is the world and its fulness.
\v 13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink the blood of he-goats?
\v 14 Sacrifice to God confession, And complete to the Most High your vows.
\v 15 And call Me in a day of adversity, I deliver you, and you honourest Me.
\v 16 And to the wicked had God said: What to you — to recount My statutes? That you liftest up My covenant on your mouth?
\v 17 Yea, you hast hated instruction, And will cast My words behind you.
\v 18 If you hast seen a thief, Then you are pleased with him, And with adulterers is your portion.
\v 19 Your mouth you hast sent forth with evil, And your tongue joineth deceit together,
\v 20 You sittest, against your brother you speakest, Against a son of your mother givest slander.
\v 21 These you did, and I kept silent, You hast thought that I am like you, I reprove you, and set in array before yours eyes.
\v 22 Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are forgetting God, Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.
\v 23 He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me, As to him who made a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of God!
\c 51
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David, in the coming in unto him of Nathan the prophet, when he had gone in unto Bath-Sheba. Favour me, O God, according to Your kindness, According to the abundance of Your mercies, Blot out my transgressions.
\v 2 Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And from my sin cleanse me,
\v 3 For my transgressions I do know, And my sin is before me continually.
\v 4 Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done the evil thing in Thine eyes, So that You are righteous in Your words, You are pure in Your judging.
\v 5 Lo, in iniquity I have been brought forth, And in sin did my mother conceive me.
\v 6 Lo, truth You hast desired in the inward parts, And in the hidden part Wisdom You causest me to know.
\v 7 You cleansest me with hyssop and I am clean, Washest me, and than snow I am whiter.
\v 8 You causest me to hear joy and gladness, You makest joyful bones You hast bruised.
\v 9 Hide Your face from my sin. And all mine iniquities blot out.
\v 10 A clean heart prepare for me, O God, And a right spirit renew within me.
\v 11 Cast me not forth from Your presence, And Your Holy Spirit take not from me.
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And a willing spirit did sustain me.
\v 13 I teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners unto Thee do return.
\v 14 Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, My tongue singeth of Your righteousness.
\v 15 O Lord, my lips you will open, And my mouth declareth Your praise.
\v 16 For You desirest not sacrifice, or I give it, Burnt-offering You acceptest not.
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A heart broken and bruised, O God, You will not despise.
\v 18 Do good in Your good pleasure with Zion, You will build the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 19 Then You desirest sacrifices of righteousness, Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, Then they offer bullocks on yours altar!
\c 52
\v 1 To the Overseer. — An instruction, by David, in the coming in of Doeg the Edomite, and he declareth to Saul, and said to him, 'David came in unto the house of Ahimelech.' What, boasteth you in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God is all the day.
\v 2 Mischiefs did your tongue devise, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
\v 3 You hast loved evil rather than good, Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.
\v 4 You hast loved all devouring words, O you deceitful tongue.
\v 5 Also — God did break you down for ever, Taketh you, and pulleth you out of the tent, And He had uprooted you Out of the land of the living. Selah.
\v 6 And the righteous see, And fear, and laugh at him.
\v 7 'Lo, the man who made not God his strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong in his mischiefs.'
\v 8 And I, as a green olive in the house of God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,
\v 9 I thank Thee to the age, because You hast done it, And I wait on Your name for it is good before Your saints!
\c 53
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On a disease.' — An instruction, by David. A fool said in his heart, 'There is no God.' They have done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There is none doing good.
\v 2 God from the heavens looked on the sons of men, To see if there be an understanding one, One seeking God.
\v 3 Every one went back, together they became filthy, There is none doing good — not even one.
\v 4 Have not workers of iniquity known, Those eating my people have eaten bread, God they have not called.
\v 5 There they feared a fear — there was no fear, For God had scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against you, You hast put to shame, For God had despised them.
\v 6 Who did give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back to a captivity of His people, Jacob did rejoice — Israel is glad!
\c 54
\v 1 To the Overseer with stringed instruments. — An instruction, by David, in the coming in of the Ziphim, and they say to Saul, 'Is not David hiding himself with us?' O God, by Your name save me, and by Your might judge me.
\v 2 O God, hear my prayer, Give ear to the sayings of my mouth,
\v 3 For strangers have risen up against me And terrible ones have sought my soul, They have not set God before them. Selah.
\v 4 Lo, God is a helper to me, The Lord is with those supporting my soul,
\v 5 Turn back did the evil thing to mine enemies, In Your truth cut them off.
\v 6 With a free will-offering I sacrifice to Thee, I thank Your name, O Yahweh, for it is good,
\v 7 For, from all adversity He delivered me, And on mine enemies had mine eye looked!
\c 55
\v 1 To the Overseer with stringed instruments. — An instruction, by David. Give ear, O God, to my prayer, And hide not from my supplication.
\v 2 Attend to me, and answer me, I mourn in my meditation, and make a noise,
\v 3 Because of the voice of an enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked, For they cause sorrow to move against me, And in anger they hate me.
\v 4 My heart is pained within me, And terrors of death have fallen on me.
\v 5 Fear and trembling come in to me, And horror did cover me.
\v 6 And I say, 'Who did give to me a pinion as a dove? I fly away and rest,
\v 7 Lo, I move far off, I lodge in a wilderness. Selah.
\v 8 I hasten escape for myself, From a rushing wind, from a whirlwind.
\v 9 Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue, For I saw violence and strife in a city.
\v 10 By day and by night they go round it, on its walls. Both iniquity and perverseness are in its middle,
\v 11 Mischiefs are in its middle. Fraud and deceit depart not from its street.
\v 12 For an enemy reproacheth me not, or I bear it, He who is hating me Hath not magnified himself against me, Or I hide from him.
\v 13 But you, a man — as mine equal, My familiar friend, and mine acquaintance.
\v 14 When together we sweeten counsel, Into the house of God we walk in company.
\v 15 Desolations are upon them, They go down to Sheol — alive, For wickedness is in their dwelling, in their middle.
\v 16 I — to God I call, and Yahweh saveth me.
\v 17 Evening, and morning, and noon, I meditate, and make a noise, and He heareth my voice,
\v 18 He had ransomed in peace my soul From him who is near to me, For with the multitude they were with me.
\v 19 God did hear and afflict them, And He sitteth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and fear not God,
\v 20 He had sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, He had polluted his covenant.
\v 21 Sweeter than honey had been his mouth, And his heart is war! Softer have been his words than oil, And they are drawn swords.
\v 22 Cast on Yahweh that which He had given you, And He did sustain you, He did not suffer for ever the moving of the righteous.
\v 23 And You, O God, will bring them down To a pit of destruction, Men of blood and deceit reach not to half their days, And I — I do trust in Thee!
\c 56
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On the Dumb Dove far off.' — A secret treasure of David, in the Philistines' taking hold of him in Gath. Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day fighting he oppresseth me,
\v 2 Mine enemies have swallowed up all the day, For many are fighting against me, O most High,
\v 3 The day I am afraid I am confident toward Thee.
\v 4 In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, I fear not what flesh did to me.
\v 5 All the day they wrest my words, Concerning me all their thoughts are for evil,
\v 6 They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, When they have expected my soul.
\v 7 By iniquity they escape, In anger the peoples put down, O God.
\v 8 My wandering You hast counted, You — place You my tear in Your bottle, Are they not in Your book?
\v 9 Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God is for me.
\v 10 In God I praise the word, In Yahweh I praise the word.
\v 11 In God I trusted, I fear not what man did to me,
\v 12 On me, O God, are Your vows, I repay thank-offerings to Thee.
\v 13 For You hast delivered my soul from death, Dost You not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God in the light of the living!
\c 57
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not.' — A secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Your wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over.
\v 2 I call to God Most High, To God who is perfecting for me.
\v 3 He sent from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached — who is panting after me. Selah. God sent forth His kindness and His truth.
\v 4 My soul is in the middle of lions, I lie down among flames — sons of men, Their teeth are a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
\v 5 Be You exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour.
\v 6 A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down had my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its middle. Selah.
\v 7 Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise.
\v 8 Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn.
\v 9 I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations.
\v 10 For great unto the heavens is Your kindness, And unto the clouds Your truth.
\v 11 Be you exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!
\c 58
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not.' — A secret treasure, by David. Is it true, O dumb one, righteously you speak? Uprightly you judge, O sons of men?
\v 2 Even in heart you work iniquities, In the land the violence of your hands you ponder.
\v 3 The wicked have been estranged from the womb, They have erred from the belly, speaking lies.
\v 4 Their poison is as poison of a serpent, As a deaf asp shutting its ear,
\v 5 Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers, A charmer of charms most skilful.
\v 6 O God, break their teeth in their mouth, The jaw-teeth of young lions break down, O Yahweh.
\v 7 They are melted as waters, They go up and down for themselves, His arrow proceedeth as they cut themselves off.
\v 8 As a snail that melteth he went on, As an untimely birth of a woman, They have not seen the sun.
\v 9 Before your pots discern the bramble, As well the raw as the heated He whirleth away.
\v 10 The righteous rejoiceth that he had seen vengeance, His steps he washeth in the blood of the wicked.
\v 11 And man said: 'Surely fruit is for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!'
\c 59
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not,' by David. — A secret treasure, in Saul's sending, and they watch the house to put him to death. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God, From my withstanders set me on high.
\v 2 Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And from men of blood save me.
\v 3 For, behold, they laid wait for my soul, Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O Yahweh.
\v 4 Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see.
\v 5 And You, Yahweh, God of Hosts, God of Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah.
\v 6 They turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And go round about the city.
\v 7 Lo, they belch out with their mouths, Swords are in their lips, for 'Who heareth?'
\v 8 And You, O Yahweh will laugh at them, You will mock at all the nations.
\v 9 O my Strength, unto Thee I take heed, For God is my tower — the God of my kindness.
\v 10 God did go before me, He caused me to look on mine enemies.
\v 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget, Shake them by Your strength, And bring them down, O Lord our shield.
\v 12 The sin of their mouth is a word of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And from the curse and lying they recount.
\v 13 Consume in fury, consume and they are not, And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.
\v 14 And they turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And they go round about the city.
\v 15 They — they wander for food, If they are not satisfied — then they murmur.
\v 16 And I — I sing of Your strength, And I sing at morn of Your kindness, For you hast been a tower to me, And a refuge for me in a day of adversity.
\v 17 O my Strength, unto Thee I sing praise, For God is my tower, the God of my kindness!
\c 60
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'Concerning the Lily of Testimony,' a secret treasure of David, to teach, in his striving with Aram-Naharaim, and with Aram-Zobah, and Joab turneth back and smiteth Edom in the valley of Salt — twelve thousand. O God, You hadst cast us off, You hadst broken us — hadst been angry! — You will turn back to us.
\v 2 You hast caused the land to tremble, You hast broken it, Heal its breaches, for it had moved.
\v 3 You hast shewn Your people a hard thing, You hast caused us to drink wine of trembling.
\v 4 You hast given to those fearing you an ensign. To be lifted up as an ensign Because of truth. Selah.
\v 5 That Your beloved ones may be drawn out, Save with Your right hand, and answer us.
\v 6 God had spoken in His holiness: I exult — I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
\v 7 Mine is Gilead, and mine is Manasseh, And Ephraim is the strength of my head, Judah is my lawgiver,
\v 8 Moab is my pot for washing, over Edom I cast my shoe, Shout, concerning me, O Philistia.
\v 9 Who did bring me to a city of bulwarks? Who had led me unto Edom?
\v 10 Is it not You, O God? hast You cast us off? And will You not go forth, O God, with our hosts!
\v 11 Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the deliverance of man.
\v 12 In God we do mightily, And He treadeth down our adversaries!
\c 61
\v 1 To the Overseer, on stringed instruments. — By David. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer.
\v 2 From the end of the land unto Thee I call, In the feebleness of my heart, Into a rock higher than I You will lead me.
\v 3 For You hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength because of the enemy.
\v 4 I sojourn in Your tent to the ages, I trust in the secret place of Your wings. Selah.
\v 5 For You, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, You hast appointed the inheritance Of those fearing Your name.
\v 6 Days to the days of the king You addest, His years as generation and generation.
\v 7 He dwelleth to the age before God, Kindness and truth appoint — they keep him.
\v 8 So do I praise Your name for ever, When I pay my vows day by day!
\c 62
\v 1 To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. — A Psalm of David. Only — toward God is my soul silent, From Him is my salvation.
\v 2 Only — He is my rock, and my salvation, My tower, I am not much moved.
\v 3 Till when do you devise mischief against a man? Ye are destroyed all of you, As a wall inclined, a hedge that is cast down.
\v 4 Only — from his excellency They have consulted to drive away, They enjoy a lie, with their mouth they bless, And with their heart revile. Selah.
\v 5 Only — for God, be silent, O my soul, For from Him is my hope.
\v 6 Only — He is my rock and my salvation, My tower, I am not moved.
\v 7 On God is my salvation, and my honour, The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
\v 8 Trust in Him at all times, O people, Pour forth before Him your heart, God is a refuge for us. Selah.
\v 9 Only — vanity are the low, a lie the high. In balances to go up they than vanity are lighter.
\v 10 Trust not in oppression, And in robbery become not vain, Wealth — when it increaseth — set not the heart.
\v 11 Once had God spoken, twice I heard this, That 'strength is with God.'
\v 12 And with Thee, O Lord, is kindness, For You will recompense to each, According to his work!
\c 63
\v 1 A Psalm of David, in his being in the wilderness of Judah. O God, You are my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee had my soul, Longed for Thee had my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters.
\v 2 So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Your strength and Thine honour.
\v 3 Because better is Your kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee.
\v 4 So I bless Thee in my life, in Your name I lift up my hands.
\v 5 As with milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And with singing lips did my mouth praise.
\v 6 If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches — I meditate on Thee.
\v 7 For You hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing.
\v 8 Cleaved had my soul after Thee, On me had Your right hand taken hold.
\v 9 And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth.
\v 10 They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are.
\v 11 And the king did rejoice in God, Boast himself did every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!
\c 64
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, From the fear of an enemy You keepest my life,
\v 2 Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the tumult of workers of iniquity.
\v 3 Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their arrow — a bitter word.
\v 4 To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot him, and fear not.
\v 5 They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount of the hiding of snares, They have said, 'Who did look at it?'
\v 6 They search out perverse things, 'We perfected a searching search,' And the inward part of man, and the heart are deep.
\v 7 And God did shoot them with an arrow, Sudden have been their wounds,
\v 8 And they cause him to stumble, Against them is their own tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.
\v 9 And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed they have considered wisely.
\v 10 The righteous did rejoice in Yahweh, And had trusted in Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of heart!
\c 65
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. A Song. To Thee, silence — praise, O God, is in Zion, And to Thee is a vow completed.
\v 2 Hearer of prayer, to Thee all flesh came.
\v 3 Matters of iniquities were mightier than I, Our transgressions — You will cover them.
\v 4 O the happiness of him whom You choosest, And drawest near, he inhabiteth Your courts, We are satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple.
\v 5 By fearful things in righteousness You answerest us, O God of our salvation, The confidence of all far off ends of earth and sea.
\v 6 Establishing mountains by His power, He had been girded with might,
\v 7 Restraining the noise of seas, the noise of their billows, And the multitude of the peoples.
\v 8 And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts From Your signs are afraid, The outgoings of morning and evening You causest to sing.
\v 9 You hast inspected the earth, and waterest it, You makest it very rich, the rivulet of God is full of water, You preparest their corn, When thus You will prepare it,
\v 10 Its ridges have been filled, Deepened had been its furrow, With showers You will soften it, Its springing up You blessest.
\v 11 You hast crowned the year of Your goodness, And Your paths drop fatness.
\v 12 Drop do the pastures of a wilderness, And joy of the heights You girdest on.
\v 13 Clothed have lambs the flock, And valleys are covered with corn, They shout — yea, they sing!
\c 66
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Song, a Psalm. Shout you to God, all the earth.
\v 2 Praise you the honour of His name, Make you honourable His praise.
\v 3 Say to God, 'How fearful are Your works, By the abundance of Your strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee.
\v 4 All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Your name.' Selah.
\v 5 Come you, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men.
\v 6 He had turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.
\v 7 Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.
\v 8 Bless, you peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,
\v 9 Who had placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved.
\v 10 For You hast tried us, O God, You hast refined us as the refining of silver.
\v 11 You hast brought us into a net, You hast placed pressure on our loins.
\v 12 You hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And You bringest us out to a watered place.
\v 13 I enter Your house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,
\v 14 For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:
\v 15 'Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.' Selah.
\v 16 Come, hear, all you who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul.
\v 17 Unto Him with my mouth I have called, And exaltation is under my tongue.
\v 18 Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord did not hear.
\v 19 But God had heard, He had attended to the voice of my prayer.
\v 20 Blessed is God, Who had not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!
\c 67
\v 1 To the Overseer, with stringed instruments. — A Psalm, a Song. God did favour us and bless us, Doth cause His face to shine with us. Selah.
\v 2 For the knowledge in earth of Your way, among all nations of Your salvation.
\v 3 Praise Thee do peoples, O God, Praise Thee do peoples, all of them.
\v 4 Rejoice and sing do nations, For You judgest peoples uprightly, And peoples on earth comfortest. Selah.
\v 5 Confess Thee do peoples, O God, Confess Thee do peoples — all of them.
\v 6 Earth had given her increase, God did bless us — our God,
\v 7 God did bless us, and all ends of earth fear Him!
\c 68
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm, a song of David. Rise did God — scattered are His enemies! And those hating Him flee from His face.
\v 2 As the driving away of smoke You drivest away, As the melting of wax before fire, The wicked perish at the presence of God.
\v 3 And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, And they joy with gladness.
\v 4 Sing you to God — praise His name, Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, In Jah is His name, and exult before Him.
\v 5 Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, Is God in His holy habitation.
\v 6 God — causing the lonely to dwell at home, Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, Only — the refractory have inhabited a dry place.
\v 7 O God, in Your going forth before Your people, In Your stepping through the wilderness, Selah.
\v 8 The earth had shaken, Yea, the heavens have dropped before God, This Sinai — before God, the God of Israel.
\v 9 A shower of free-will gifts you shakest out, O God. Thine inheritance, when it had been weary, You hast established it.
\v 10 Your company have dwelt in it, You preparest in Your goodness for the poor, O God.
\v 11 The Lord did give the saying, The female proclaimers are a numerous host.
\v 12 Kings of hosts flee utterly away, And a female inhabitant of the house apportioneth spoil.
\v 13 Yough you do lie between two boundaries, Wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.
\v 14 When the Mighty spreadeth kings in it, It did snow in Salmon.
\v 15 A hill of God is the hill of Bashan, A hill of heights is the hill of Bashan.
\v 16 Why do you envy, O high hills, The hill God had desired for His seat? Yahweh also did tabernacle for ever.
\v 17 The chariots of God are myriads, thousands of changes, The Lord is among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
\v 18 You hast ascended on high, You hast taken captive captivity, You hast taken gifts for men, That even the refractory may rest, O Jah God.
\v 19 Blessed is the Lord, day by day He laid on us. God Himself is our salvation. Selah.
\v 20 God Himself is to us a God for deliverances, And Yahweh Lord had the outgoings of death.
\v 21 Only — God did smite The head of His enemies, The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.
\v 22 The Lord said: 'From Bashan I bring back, I bring back from the depths of the sea.
\v 23 So that you dashest your foot in blood, In the blood of enemies — the tongue of Your dogs.'
\v 24 They have seen Your goings, O God, Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.
\v 25 Singers have been before, Behind are players on instruments, In the middle virgins playing with timbrels.
\v 26 In assemblies bless you God, The Lord — from the fountain of Israel.
\v 27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, Heads of Judah their defence, Heads of Zebulun — heads of Naphtali.
\v 28 Your God had commanded your strength, Be strong, O God, this You hast wrought for us.
\v 29 Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, To Thee do kings bring a present.
\v 30 Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a company of bulls, With calves of the peoples, Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, Scatter You peoples delighting in conflicts.
\v 31 Come do fat ones out of Egypt, Cush caused her hands to run to God.
\v 32 Kingdoms of the earth, sing you to God, Praise you the Lord. Selah.
\v 33 To him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, Lo, He gave with His voice a strong voice.
\v 34 Ascribe you strength to God, Over Israel is His excellency, and His strength in the clouds.
\v 35 Fearful, O God, out of Your sanctuaries, The God of Israel Himself, Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed is God!
\c 69
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies,' by David. Save me, O God, for come have waters unto the soul.
\v 2 I have sunk in deep mire, And there is no standing, I have come into the depths of the waters, And a flood had overflown me.
\v 3 I have been wearied with my calling, Burnt had been my throat, Consumed have been mine eyes, waiting for my God.
\v 4 Those hating me without cause Have been more than the hairs of my head, Mighty have been my destroyers, My lying enemies, That which I took not away — I bring back.
\v 5 O God, You — You hast known Concerning my overturn, And my desolations from Thee have not been hid.
\v 6 Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed because of me, O Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Let not those seeking Thee Blush because of me, O God of Israel.
\v 7 For because of Thee I have borne reproach, Shame had covered my face.
\v 8 A stranger I have been to my brother, And a foreigner to sons of my mother.
\v 9 For zeal for Your house had consumed me, And the reproaches of Your reproachers Have fallen upon me.
\v 10 And I weep in the fasting of my soul, And it is for a reproach to me.
\v 11 And I make my clothing sackcloth, And I am to them for a simile.
\v 12 Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, And those drinking strong drink, Play on instruments.
\v 13 And I — my prayer is to Thee, O Yahweh, A time of good pleasure, O God, In the abundance of Your kindness, Answer me in the truth of Your salvation.
\v 14 Deliver me from the mire, and let me not sink, Let me be delivered from those hating me, And from deep places of waters.
\v 15 Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me.
\v 16 Answer me, O Yahweh, for good is Your kindness, According to the abundance Of Your mercies turn You unto me,
\v 17 And hide not Your face from Your servant, For I am in distress — haste, answer me.
\v 18 Be near unto my soul — redeem it, Because of mine enemies ransom me.
\v 19 You — You hast known my reproach, And my shame, and my blushing, Before Thee are all mine adversaries.
\v 20 Reproach had broken my heart, and I am sick, And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, And for comforters, and I have found none.
\v 21 And they give for my food gall, And for my thirst cause me to drink vinegar.
\v 22 Their table before them is for a snare, And for a recompence — for a trap.
\v 23 Darkened are their eyes from seeing, And their loins continually shake You.
\v 24 Pour upon them Thine indignation, And the fierceness of Thine anger did seize them.
\v 25 Their tower is desolated, In their tents there is no dweller.
\v 26 For they have pursued him You hast smitten, And recount of the pain of Your pierced ones.
\v 27 Give punishment for their iniquity, And they enter not into Your righteousness.
\v 28 They are blotted out of the book of life, And with the righteous are not written.
\v 29 And I am afflicted and pained, Your salvation, O God, did set me on high.
\v 30 I praise the name of God with a song, And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,
\v 31 And it is better to Yahweh than an ox, A bullock — horned — hoofed.
\v 32 The humble have seen — they rejoice, Ye who seek God — and your heart lived.
\v 33 For Yahweh hearkeneth unto the needy, And His bound ones He had not despised.
\v 34 The heavens and earth do praise Him, Seas, and every moving thing in them.
\v 35 For God did save Zion, And did build the cities of Judah, And they have dwelt there, and possess it.
\v 36 And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those loving His name dwell in it!
\c 70
\v 1 To the Overseer, by David. — 'To cause to remember.' O God, to deliver me, O Yahweh, for my help, haste.
\v 2 Let them be ashamed and confounded Who are seeking my soul, Let them be turned backward and blush Who are desiring my evil.
\v 3 Let them turn back because of their shame, Who are saying, 'Aha, aha.'
\v 4 Let all those seeking Thee joy and be glad in Thee, And let those loving Your salvation Say continually, 'God is magnified.'
\v 5 And I am poor and needy, O God, haste to me, My help and my deliverer are You, O Yahweh, tarry You not!
\c 71
\v 1 In Thee, O Yahweh, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age.
\v 2 In Your righteousness You will deliver me, And will cause me to escape, Incline unto me Thine ear, and save me.
\v 3 Be to me for a rock — a habitation, To go in continually, You hast given command to save me, For my rock and my bulwark are You.
\v 4 O my God, cause me to escape From the hand of the wicked, From the hand of the perverse and violent.
\v 5 For You are my hope, O Lord Yahweh, My trust from my youth.
\v 6 By Thee I have been supported from the womb, From my mother's bowels You will cut me out, In Thee is my praise continually.
\v 7 As a wonder I have been to many, And You are my strong refuge.
\v 8 Filled is my mouth with Your praise, All the day with Your beauty.
\v 9 Cast me not off at the time of old age, According to the consumption of my power forsake me not.
\v 10 For mine enemies have spoken against me, And those watching my soul have taken counsel together,
\v 11 Saying, 'God had forsaken him, Pursue and catch him, for there is no deliverer.'
\v 12 O God, be not far from me, O my God, for my help make haste.
\v 13 They are ashamed, they are consumed, Who are opposing my soul, They are covered with reproach and blushing, Who are seeking my evil,
\v 14 And I continually do wait with hope, And have added unto all Your praise.
\v 15 My mouth recounteth Your righteousness, All the day Your salvation, For I have not known the numbers.
\v 16 I come in the might of the Lord Yahweh, I mention Your righteousness — Thine only.
\v 17 God, You hast taught me from my youth, And hitherto I declare Your wonders.
\v 18 And also unto old age and grey hairs, O God, forsake me not, Till I declare Your strength to a generation, To every one that came Your might.
\v 19 And Your righteousness, O God, is unto the heights, Because You hast done great things, O God, who is like Thee?
\v 20 Because You hast showed me many and sad distresses, You turnest back — You revivest me, And from the depths of the earth, You turnest back — You bringest me up.
\v 21 You will increase my greatness, And You surroundest — You comfortest me,
\v 22 I also thank Thee with a vessel of psaltery, Your truth, O my God, I sing to Thee with a harp, O Holy One of Israel,
\v 23 My lips cry aloud when I sing praise to Thee, And my soul that You hast redeemed,
\v 24 My tongue also all the day uttereth Your righteousness, Because ashamed — because confounded, Have been those seeking my evil!
\c 72
\v 1 By Solomon. O God, Your judgments to the king give, And Your righteousness to the king's son.
\v 2 He judgeth Your people with righteousness, And Your poor with judgment.
\v 3 The mountains bear peace to the people, And the heights by righteousness.
\v 4 He judgeth the poor of the people, Giveth deliverance to the sons of the needy, And bruiseth the oppressor.
\v 5 They fear Thee with the sun, and before the moon, Generation — generations.
\v 6 He came down as rain on mown grass, As showers — sprinkling the earth.
\v 7 Flourish in his days did the righteous, And abundance of peace till the moon is not.
\v 8 And he ruleth from sea unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.
\v 9 Before him bow do the inhabitants of the dry places, And his enemies lick the dust.
\v 10 Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near.
\v 11 And all kings do bow themselves to him, All nations do serve him,
\v 12 For he delivereth the needy who crieth, And the poor when he had no helper,
\v 13 He had pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he saveth,
\v 14 From fraud and from violence he redeemeth their soul, And precious is their blood in his eyes.
\v 15 And he lived, and gave to him of the gold of Sheba, And prayeth for him continually, All the day he did bless him.
\v 16 There is a handful of corn in the earth, On the top of mountains, Shake like Lebanon did its fruit, And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.
\v 17 His name is to the age, Before the sun is his name continued, And they bless themselves in him, All nations do pronounce him happy.
\v 18 Blessed is Yahweh God, God of Israel, He alone is doing wonders,
\v 19 And blessed is the Name of His honour to the age, And the whole earth is filled with His honour. Amen, and amen!
\v 20 The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.
\c 73
\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. Only — good to Israel is God, to the clean of heart. And I — as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside,
\v 2 As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,
\v 3 The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,
\v 4 And their might is firm.
\v 5 In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.
\v 6 Therefore had pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.
\v 7 Their eye had come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;
\v 8 They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.
\v 9 They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walks in the earth.
\v 10 Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.
\v 11 And they have said, 'How had God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'
\v 12 Lo, these are the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength.
\v 13 Only — a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,
\v 14 And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof is every morning.
\v 15 If I have said, 'I recount thus,' Lo, a generation of Your sons I have deceived.
\v 16 And I think to know this, Perverseness it is in mine eyes,
\v 17 Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.
\v 18 Only, in slippery places You will set them, You hast caused them to fall to desolations.
\v 19 How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended — consumed from terrors.
\v 20 As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image You despisest.
\v 21 For my heart did show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,
\v 22 And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee.
\v 23 And I am continually with Thee, You hast laid hold on my right hand.
\v 24 With Your counsel You will lead me, And after honour will receive me.
\v 25 Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.
\v 26 Consumed had been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion is God to the age.
\v 27 For, behold, those far from Thee do perish, You hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.
\v 28 And I — nearness of God to me is good, I have placed in the Lord Yahweh my refuge, To recount all Your works!

\v 1 An Instruction of Asaph. Why, O God, hast You cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Your pasture.
\v 2 Remember Your company. You did purchase of old, You did redeem the rod of Your inheritance, This mount Zion — You did dwell in it.
\v 3 Lift up Your steps to the perpetual desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.
\v 4 Roared have yours adversaries, In the middle of Your meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.
\v 5 He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood — axes.
\v 6 And now, its carvings together With axe and hatchet they break down,
\v 7 They have sent into fire Your sanctuary, to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Your name,
\v 8 They said in their hearts, 'Let us oppress them together,' They did burn all the meeting-places of God in the land.
\v 9 Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.
\v 10 Till when, O God, did an adversary reproach? Doth an enemy despise your name for ever?
\v 11 Why will You turn back Your hand, Even Your right hand? From the middle of Your bosom remove it.
\v 12 And God is my king of old, Working salvation in the middle of the earth.
\v 13 You hast broken by Your strength a sea -monster, You hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters,
\v 14 You hast broken the heads of leviathan, You makest him food, For the people of the dry places.
\v 15 You hast cleaved a fountain and a stream, You hast dried up perennial flowings.
\v 16 Thine is the day, also Thine is the night, You hast prepared a light giver — the sun.
\v 17 You hast set up all the borders of earth, Summer and winter You hast formed them.
\v 18 Remember this — an enemy reproached Yahweh, And a foolish people have despised Your name.
\v 19 Give not up to a company, The soul of Your turtle-dove, The company of Your poor ones forget not for ever.
\v 20 Look attentively to the covenant, For the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.
\v 21 Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Your name,
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead Your plea, Remember Your reproach from a fool all the day.
\v 23 Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The noise of Your withstanders is going up continually!
\c 75
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not.' — A Psalm of Asaph. — A Song. We have given thanks to Thee, O God, We have given thanks, and near is Your name, They have recounted Your wonders.
\v 2 When I receive an appointment, I — I do judge uprightly.
\v 3 Melted is the earth and all its inhabitants, I — I have pondered its pillars. Selah.
\v 4 I have said to the boastful, 'Be not boastful,' And to the wicked, 'Raise not up a horn.'
\v 5 Raise not up on high your horn, (Ye speak with a stiff neck.)
\v 6 For not from the east, or from the west, Nor from the wilderness — is elevation.
\v 7 But God is judge, This He made low — and this He lifteth up.
\v 8 For a cup is in the hand of Yahweh, And the wine had foamed, It is full of mixture, and He poureth out of it, Only its dregs wring out, and drink, Do all the wicked of the earth,
\v 9 And I — I declare it to the age, I sing praise to the God of Jacob.
\v 10 And all horns of the wicked I cut off, Exalted are the horns of the righteous!
\c 76
\v 1 To the Overseer with stringed instruments. — A Psalm of Asaph. — A Song. In Judah is God known, in Israel His name is great.
\v 2 And His tabernacle is in Salem, And His habitation in Zion.
\v 3 There he had shivered arrows of a bow, Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.
\v 4 Bright are You, honourable above hills of prey.
\v 5 Spoiled themselves have the mighty of heart, They have slept their sleep, And none of the men of might found their hands.
\v 6 From Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse have been fast asleep.
\v 7 You, fearful are You, And who did stand before Thee, Since You hast been angry!
\v 8 From heaven You hast sounded judgment, Earth had feared, and had been still,
\v 9 In the rising of God to judgment, To save all the humble of earth. Selah.
\v 10 For the fierceness of man praiseth Thee, The remnant of fierceness You girdest on.
\v 11 Vow and complete to Yahweh your God, All you surrounding him. They bring presents to the Fearful One.
\v 12 He did gather the spirit of leaders, Fearful to the kings of earth!
\c 77
\v 1 To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. — A Psalm of Asaph. My voice is to God, and I cry, my voice is to God, And He had given ear unto me.
\v 2 In a day of my distress the Lord I sought, My hand by night had been spread out, And it did not cease, My soul had refused to be comforted.
\v 3 I remember God, and make a noise, I meditate, and feeble is my spirit. Selah.
\v 4 You hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes, I have been moved, and I speak not.
\v 5 I have reckoned the days of old, The years of the ages.
\v 6 I remember my music in the night, With my heart I meditate, and my spirit did search diligently:
\v 7 To the ages did the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?
\v 8 Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?
\v 9 Hath God forgotten His favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah.
\v 10 And I say: 'My weakness is, The changes of the right hand of the Most High.'
\v 11 I mention the doings of Jah, For I remember of old Your wonders,
\v 12 And I have meditated on all Your working, And I talk concerning Your doings.
\v 13 O God, in holiness is Your way, Who is a great god like God?
\v 14 You are the God doing wonders. You hast made known among the peoples Your strength,
\v 15 You hast redeemed with strength Your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
\v 16 The waters have seen Thee, O God, The waters have seen Thee, They are afraid — also depths are troubled.
\v 17 Poured out waters have thick clouds, The skies have given forth a noise, Also — Thine arrows go up and down.
\v 18 The voice of Your thunder is in the spheres, Lightnings have lightened the world, The earth had trembled, yea, it shaketh.
\v 19 In the sea is Your way, And Your paths are in many waters, And Your tracks have not been known.
\v 20 You hast led as a flock Your people, By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
\c 78
\v 1 An Instruction of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law, Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.
\v 2 I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things of old,
\v 3 That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have recounted to us.
\v 4 We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation recounting praises of Yahweh, And His strength, and His wonders that He had done.
\v 5 And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law had placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them known to their sons.
\v 6 So that a later generation did know, Sons who are born, do rise and recount to their sons,
\v 7 And place in God their confidence, And forget not the doings of God, But keep His commands.
\v 8 And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate and rebellious, A generation! it had not prepared its heart, Nor stedfast with God is its spirit.
\v 9 Sons of Ephraim — armed bearers of bow, Have turned in a day of conflict.
\v 10 They have not kept the covenant of God, And in His law they have refused to walk,
\v 11 And they forget His doings, And His wonders that He showed them.
\v 12 Before their fathers He had done wonders, In the land of Egypt — the field of Zoan.
\v 13 He cleft a sea, and caused them to pass over, Yea, He caused waters to stand as a heap.
\v 14 And leadeth them with a cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.
\v 15 He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And gave drink — as the great deep.
\v 16 And brought out streams from a rock, And caused waters to come down as rivers.
\v 17 And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most High in the dry place.
\v 18 And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their lust.
\v 19 And they speak against God — they said: 'Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?'
\v 20 Lo, He had smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams overflow. 'Also — bread is He able to give? Doth He prepare flesh for His people?'
\v 21 Therefore had Yahweh heard, And He sheweth Himself wroth, And fire had been kindled against Jacob, And anger also had gone up against Israel,
\v 22 For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted in His salvation.
\v 23 And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the heavens He had opened.
\v 24 And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven He had given to them.
\v 25 Food of the mighty had each eaten, Venison He sent to them to satiety.
\v 26 He caused an east wind to journey in the heavens, And leadeth by His strength a south wind,
\v 27 And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the seas — winged fowl,
\v 28 And caused it to fall in the middle of His camp, Round about His tabernacles.
\v 29 And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire He brought to them.
\v 30 They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet is their food in their mouth,
\v 31 And the anger of God had gone up against them, And He slaid among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to bend.
\v 32 With all this they have sinned again, And have not believed in His wonders.
\v 33 And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in trouble.
\v 34 If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back, and sought God earnestly,
\v 35 And they remember that God is their rock, And God Most High their redeemer.
\v 36 And — they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,
\v 37 And their heart had not been right with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant.
\v 38 And He — the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and destroyeth not, And had often turned back His anger, And waketh not up all His fury.
\v 39 And He remembered that they are flesh, A wind going on — and it returneth not.
\v 40 How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve Him in the desolate place?
\v 41 Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of Israel have limited.
\v 42 They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary.
\v 43 When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan,
\v 44 And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods they drink not.
\v 45 He sent among them the beetle, and it consumeth them, And the frog, and it destroyeth them,
\v 46 And gave to the caterpillar their increase, And their labour to the locust.
\v 47 He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores with frost,
\v 48 And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their cattle to the burning flames.
\v 49 He sent on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and distress — A discharge of evil messengers.
\v 50 He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered up.
\v 51 And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.
\v 52 And caused His people to journey as a flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,
\v 53 And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been afraid, And their enemies had the sea covered.
\v 54 And He brought them in unto the border of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,
\v 55 And threw out nations from before them, And caused them to fall in the line of inheritance, And caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,
\v 56 And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His testimonies have not kept.
\v 57 And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,
\v 58 And make Him angry with their high places, And with their graven images make Him zealous,
\v 59 God had heard, and sheweth Himself wroth. And kicketh exceedingly against Israel.
\v 60 And He leaveth the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men,
\v 61 And He gave His strength to captivity, And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,
\v 62 And delivereth up to the sword His people, And with His inheritance showed Himself angry.
\v 63 His young men had fire consumed, And His virgins have not been praised.
\v 64 His priests by the sword have fallen, And their widows weep not.
\v 65 And the Lord waketh as a sleeper, As a mighty one crying aloud from wine.
\v 66 And He smiteth His adversaries backward, A reproach age-during He had put on them,
\v 67 And He kicketh against the tent of Joseph, And on the tribe of Ephraim had not fixed.
\v 68 And He chooseth the tribe of Judah, With mount Zion that He loved,
\v 69 And built His sanctuary as a high place, Like the earth, He founded it to the age.
\v 70 And He fixeth on David His servant, And took him from the folds of a flock,
\v 71 From behind suckling ones He had brought him in, To rule over Jacob His people, And over Israel His inheritance.
\v 72 And he ruleth them according to the integrity of his heart, And by the skilfulness of his hands leadeth them!
\c 79
\v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. O God, nations have come into Your inheritance, They have defiled Your holy temple, They made Jerusalem become heaps,
\v 2 They gave the dead bodies of Your servants Food for the fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Your saints For the wild beast of the earth.
\v 3 They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem, And there is none burying.
\v 4 We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.
\v 5 Till when, O Yahweh? are You angry for ever? Your jealousy did burn as fire.
\v 6 Pour Your fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And on kingdoms that have not called in Your name.
\v 7 For one had devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have made desolate.
\v 8 Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste, let Your mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of Your name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Your name's sake.
\v 10 Why do the nations say, 'Where is their God?' Let be known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the blood of Your servants that is shed.
\v 11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee, According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave You the sons of death.
\v 12 And turn You back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.
\v 13 And we, Your people, and the flock of Your pasture, We give thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Your praise!
\c 80
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies.' A testimony of Asaph. — A Psalm. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Leading Joseph as a flock, Inhabiting the cherubs — shine forth,
\v 2 Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, Wake up Your might, and come for our salvation.
\v 3 O God, cause us to turn back, And cause Your face to shine, and we are saved.
\v 4 Yahweh, God of Hosts, till when? You hast burned against the prayer of Your people.
\v 5 You hast caused them to eat bread of tears, And causest them to drink With tears a third time.
\v 6 You makest us a strife to our neighbours, And our enemies mock at it.
\v 7 God of Hosts, turn us back, And cause Your face to shine, and we are saved.
\v 8 A vine out of Egypt You will bring, You will cast out nations, and plantest it.
\v 9 You hast looked before it, and will root it, And it filleth the land,
\v 10 Covered have been hills with its shadow, And its boughs are cedars of God.
\v 11 It sent forth its branches unto the sea, And unto the river its sucklings.
\v 12 Why hast You broken down its hedges, And all passing by the way have plucked it?
\v 13 A boar out of the forest did waste it, And a wild beast of the fields consumeth it.
\v 14 God of Hosts, turn back, we beseech Thee, Look from heaven, and see, and inspect this vine,
\v 15 And the root that Your right hand planted, And the branch You madest strong for Thee,
\v 16 Burnt with fire — cut down, From the rebuke of Your face they perish.
\v 17 Let Your hand be on the man of Your right hand, On the son of man You hast strengthened for Yourself.
\v 18 And we do not go back from Thee, You will revive us, and in Your name we call.
\v 19 O Yahweh, God of Hosts, turn us back, Cause Your face to shine, and we are saved!
\c 81
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On the Gittith.' By Asaph. Cry aloud to God our strength, Shout to the God of Jacob.
\v 2 Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, A pleasant harp with psaltery.
\v 3 Blow in the month a trumpet, In the new moon, at the day of our festival,
\v 4 For a statute to Israel it is, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
\v 5 A testimony on Joseph He had placed it, In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known — I hear.
\v 6 From the burden his shoulder I turned aside, His hands from the basket pass over.
\v 7 In distress you hast called and I deliver you, I answer you in the secret place of thunder, I try you by the waters of Meribah. Selah.
\v 8 Hear, O My people, and I testify to you, O Israel, if you will hearken to me:
\v 9 There is not in you a strange god, And you bowest not thyself to a strange god.
\v 10 I am Yahweh your God, Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge your mouth, and I fill it.
\v 11 But, My people hearkened not to My voice, And Israel had not consented to Me.
\v 12 And I send them away in the enmity of their heart, They walk in their own counsels.
\v 13 O that My people were hearkening to Me, Israel in My ways would walk.
\v 14 As a little thing their enemies I cause to bow, And against their adversaries I turn back My hand,
\v 15 Those hating Yahweh feign obedience to Him, But their time is — to the age.
\v 16 He caused him to eat of the fat of wheat, And with honey from a rock I satisfy you!
\c 82
\v 1  — A Psalm of Asaph. God had stood in the company of God, In the middle God did judge.
\v 2 Till when do you judge perversely? And the face of the wicked lift up? Selah.
\v 3 Judge you the weak and fatherless, The afflicted and the poor declare righteous.
\v 4 Let the weak and needy escape, From the hand of the wicked deliver them.
\v 5 They knew not, nor do they understand, In darkness they walk habitually, Moved are all the foundations of earth.
\v 6 I — I have said, 'Gods you are, And sons of the Most High — all of you,
\v 7 But as man you die, and as one of the heads you fall,
\v 8 Rise, O God, judge the earth, For You hast inheritance among all the nations!
\c 83
\v 1 A Song, — A Psalm of Asaph. O God, let there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God.
\v 2 For, behold, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have lifted up the head,
\v 3 Against Your people they take crafty counsel, And consult against Your hidden ones.
\v 4 They have said, 'Come, And we cut them off from being a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.'
\v 5 For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a covenant they make,
\v 6 Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,
\v 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre,
\v 8 Asshur also is joined with them, They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.
\v 9 Do to them as to Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the stream Kishon.
\v 10 They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the ground!
\v 11 Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes,
\v 12 Who have said, 'Let us occupy for ourselves The comely places of God.'
\v 13 O my God, make them as a rolling thing, As stubble before wind.
\v 14 As a fire did burn a forest, And as a flame setteth hills on fire,
\v 15 So will You pursue them with Your whirlwind, And with Your hurricane troublest them.
\v 16 Fill their faces with shame, And they seek Your name, O Yahweh.
\v 17 They are ashamed and troubled for ever, Yea, they are confounded and lost.
\v 18 And they know that You — (Your name is Yahweh — by Yourself,) Art the Most High over all the earth!
\c 84
\v 1 To the Overseer. — 'On the Gittith By sons of Korah.' — A Psalm. How beloved Your tabernacles, Yahweh of Hosts!
\v 2 My soul desired, yea, it had also been consumed, For the courts of Yahweh, My heart and my flesh cry aloud unto the living God,
\v 3 (Even a sparrow had found a house, And a swallow a nest for herself, Where she had placed her brood,) Thine altars, O Yahweh of Hosts, My king and my God.
\v 4 O the happiness of those inhabiting Your house, Yet do they praise Thee. Selah.
\v 5 O the happiness of a man whose strength is in Thee, Highways are in their heart.
\v 6 Those passing through a valley of weeping, A fountain do make it, Blessings also cover the director.
\v 7 They go from strength unto strength, He appeareth unto God in Zion.
\v 8 O Yahweh, God of Hosts, hear my prayer, Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
\v 9 Our shield, see, O God, And behold the face of Thine anointed,
\v 10 For good is a day in Your courts, O Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, In the house of my God, Than to dwell in tents of wickedness.
\v 11 For a sun and a shield is Yahweh God, Grace and honour did Yahweh give. He withholdeth not good To those walking in uprightness.
\v 12 Yahweh of Hosts! O the happiness of a man trusting in Thee.
\c 85
\v 1 To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. A Psalm. You hast accepted, O Yahweh, Your land, You hast turned to the captivity of Jacob.
\v 2 You hast borne away the iniquity of Your people, You hast covered all their sin. Selah.
\v 3 You hast gathered up all Your wrath, You hast turned back from the fierceness of Thine anger.
\v 4 Turn back to us, O God of our salvation, And make void Thine anger with us.
\v 5 To the age are You angry against us? Dost You draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?
\v 6 Dost You not turn back? You revivest us, And Your people do rejoice in Thee.
\v 7 Show us, O Yahweh, your kindness, And Your salvation You will give to us.
\v 8 I hear what God Yahweh spoke, For He spoke peace unto His people, And unto His saints, and they turn not back to folly.
\v 9 Only, near to those fearing Him is His salvation, That honour may dwell in our land.
\v 10 Kindness and truth have met, Righteousness and peace have kissed,
\v 11 Truth from the earth springeth up, And righteousness from heaven looketh out,
\v 12 Yahweh also gave that which is good, And our land did give its increase.
\v 13 Righteousness before Him went, And made His footsteps for a way!
\c 86
\v 1 A Prayer of David. Incline, O Yahweh, Thine ear, Answer me, for I am poor and needy.
\v 2 Keep my soul, for I am pious, Save Your servant — who is trusting to Thee, O You, my God.
\v 3 Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all the day.
\v 4 Rejoice the soul of Your servant, For unto Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up.
\v 5 For You, Lord, are good and forgiving. And abundant in kindness to all calling Thee.
\v 6 Hear, O Yahweh, my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplications.
\v 7 In a day of my distress I call Thee, For You will answer me.
\v 8 There is none like Thee among the gods, O Lord, And like Your works there are none.
\v 9 All nations that You hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee, O Lord, And give honour to Your name.
\v 10 For great are You, and doing wonders, You are God Yourself alone.
\v 11 Show me, O Yahweh, Your way, I walk in Your truth, My heart did rejoice to fear Your name.
\v 12 I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I honour Your name to the age.
\v 13 For Your kindness is great toward me, And You hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
\v 14 O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed Thee before them,
\v 15 And You, O Lord, are God, merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.
\v 16 Look unto me, and favour me, Give Your strength to Your servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid.
\v 17 Do with me a sign for good, And those hating me see and are ashamed, For You, O Yahweh, hast helped me, Yea, You hast comforted me!
\c 87
\v 1 By sons of Korah. — A Psalm, a song. His foundation is in holy mountains.
\v 2 Yahweh is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
\v 3 Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.
\v 4 I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This one was born there.
\v 5 And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, did establish her.
\v 6 Yahweh did recount in the describing of the peoples, 'This one was born there.' Selah.
\v 7 Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains are in Thee!
\c 88
\v 1 A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah, to the Overseer, 'Concerning the Sickness of Afflictions.' — An instruction, by Heman the Ezrahite. O Yahweh, God of my salvation, Daily I have cried, nightly before Thee,
\v 2 My prayer came in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my loud cry,
\v 3 For my soul had been full of evils, And my life had come to Sheol.
\v 4 I have been reckoned with those going down to the pit, I have been as a man without strength.
\v 5 Among the dead — free, As pierced ones lying in the grave, Whom You hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Your hand have been cut off.
\v 6 You hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in depths.
\v 7 Upon me had Your fury lain, And with all Your breakers You hast afflicted. Selah.
\v 8 You hast put mine acquaintance far from me, You hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up — I go not forth.
\v 9 Mine eye had grieved because of affliction, I called Thee, O Yahweh, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.
\v 10 To the dead will You do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.
\v 11 Is Your kindness recounted in the grave? Your faithfulness in destruction?
\v 12 Are Your wonders known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
\v 13 And I, unto Thee, O Yahweh, I have cried, And in the morning did my prayer come before Thee.
\v 14 Why, O Yahweh, castest You off my soul? You hidest Your face from me.
\v 15 I am afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne Your terrors — I pine away.
\v 16 Over me had Your wrath passed, Your terrors have cut me off,
\v 17 They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have gone round against me together,
\v 18 You hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine acquaintance is the place of darkness!

\v 1 An instruction, by Ethan the Ezrahite. Of the kind acts of Yahweh, to the age I sing, To all generations I make known Your faithfulness with my mouth,
\v 2 For I said, 'To the age is kindness built, The heavens! You will establish Your faithfulness in them.'
\v 3 I have made a covenant for My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant:
\v 4 'Even to the age do I establish your seed, And have built to generation and generation your throne. Selah.
\v 5 and the heavens confess Your wonders, O Yahweh, Your faithfulness also is in an assembly of holy ones.
\v 6 For who in the sky, Compareth himself to Yahweh? Is like to Yahweh among sons of the mighty?
\v 7 God is very terrible, In the secret counsel of His holy ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.
\v 8 O Yahweh, God of Hosts, Who is like Thee — a strong Jah? And Your faithfulness is round about Thee.
\v 9 You are ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its billows You will restrain them.
\v 10 You hast bruised Rahab, as one wounded. With the arm of Your strength You hast scattered Thine enemies.
\v 11 Thine are the heavens — the earth also is Thine, The habitable world and its fulness, You hast founded them.
\v 12 North and south You hast appointed them, Tabor and Hermon in Your name do sing.
\v 13 You hast an arm with might, Strong is Your hand — high Your right hand.
\v 14 Righteousness and judgment Are the fixed place of Your throne, Kindness and truth go before Your face.
\v 15 O the happiness of the people knowing the shout, O Yahweh, in the light of Your face they walk habitually.
\v 16 In Your name they rejoice all the day, And in Your righteousness they are exalted,
\v 17 For the beauty of their strength are You, And in Your good will is our horn exalted,
\v 18 For of Yahweh is our shield, And of the Holy One of Israel our king.
\v 19 Then You hast spoken in vision, To Your saint, yea, You sayest, I have placed help upon a mighty one, Exalted a chosen one out of the people,
\v 20 I have found David My servant, With My holy oil I have anointed him.
\v 21 With whom My hand is established, My arm also did strengthen him.
\v 22 An enemy exacteth not upon him, And a son of perverseness afflicteth him not.
\v 23 And I have beaten down before him his adversaries, And those hating him I plague,
\v 24 And My faithfulness and kindness are with him, And in My name is his horn exalted.
\v 25 And I have set on the sea his hand, And on the rivers his right hand.
\v 26 He proclaimeth me: 'You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.'
\v 27 I also first-born do appoint him, Highest of the kings of the earth.
\v 28 To the age I keep for him My kindness, And My covenant is stedfast with him.
\v 29 And I have set his seed for ever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.
\v 30 If his sons forsake My law, And in My judgments do not walk;
\v 31 If My statutes they pollute, And My commands do not keep,
\v 32 I have looked after with a rod their transgression, And with strokes their iniquity,
\v 33 And My kindness I break not from him, Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.
\v 34 I profane not My covenant, And that which is going forth from My lips I change not.
\v 35 Once I have sworn by My holiness, I lie not to David,
\v 36 His seed is to the age, And his throne is as the sun before Me,
\v 37 As the moon it is established — to the age, And the witness in the sky is stedfast. Selah.
\v 38 And You, You hast cast off, and will reject, You hast shown Yourself wroth With Thine anointed,
\v 39 Hast rejected the covenant of Your servant, You hast polluted to the earth his crown,
\v 40 You hast broken down all his hedges, You hast made his fenced places a ruin.
\v 41 Spoiled him have all passing by the way, He had been a reproach to his neighbours,
\v 42 You hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries, You hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.
\v 43 Also — You turnest back the sharpness of his sword, And hast not established him in battle,
\v 44 Hast caused him to cease from his brightness, And his throne to the earth hast cast down.
\v 45 You hast shortened the days of his youth, Hast covered him over with shame. Selah.
\v 46 Till when, O Yahweh, are You hidden? For ever did Your fury burn as fire?
\v 47 Remember, I pray Thee, what is life-time? Wherefore in vain hast You created All the sons of men?
\v 48 Who is the man that lived, and did not see death? He delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.
\v 49 Where are Your former kindnesses, O Lord. You hast sworn to David in Your faithfulness,
\v 50 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,
\v 51 Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O Yahweh, Wherewith they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.
\v 52 Blessed is Yahweh to the age. Amen, and amen!
\c 90
\v 1 A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, a habitation You — You hast been, To us — in generation and generation,
\v 2 Before mountains were brought forth, And You will form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age You are God.
\v 3 You turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn back, you sons of men.
\v 4 For a thousand years in Thine eyes are as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night.
\v 5 You hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth.
\v 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and had changed, At evening it is cut down, and had withered.
\v 7 For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Your fury we have been troubled.
\v 8 You hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things at the light of Your face,
\v 9 For all our days pined away in Your wrath, We consumed our years as a meditation.
\v 10 Days of our years, in them are seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet is their enlargement labour and vanity, For it had been cut off hastily, and we fly away.
\v 11 Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Your fear — Your wrath?
\v 12 To number our days aright let us know, And we bring the heart to wisdom.
\v 13 Turn back, O Yahweh, till when? And repent concerning Your servants.
\v 14 Satisfy us at morn with Your kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days.
\v 15 Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein You hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.
\v 16 Let Your work appear unto Your servants, And Thine honour on their sons.
\v 17 And let the pleasantness of Yahweh our God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work of our hands establish it!
\c 91
\v 1 He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,
\v 2 He is saying of Yahweh, 'My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,'
\v 3 For He delivereth you from the snare of a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.
\v 4 With His pinion He covereth you over, And under His wings you will trust, A shield and buckler is His truth.
\v 5 You are not afraid of fear by night, Of arrow that flieth by day,
\v 6 Of pestilence in thick darkness that walks, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,
\v 7 There fall at your side a thousand, And a myriad at your right hand, Unto you it came not nigh.
\v 8 But with yours eyes you lookest, And the reward of the wicked you seest,
\v 9 (For You, O Yahweh, are my refuge,) The Most High you madest your habitation.
\v 10 Evil happeneth not unto you, And a plague came not near your tent,
\v 11 For His messengers He chargeth for you, To keep you in all your ways,
\v 12 On the hands they bear you up, Lest you smite against a stone your foot.
\v 13 On lion and asp you treadest, You trampest young lion and dragon.
\v 14 Because in Me he had delighted, I also deliver him — I set him on high, Because he had known My name.
\v 15 He did call Me, and I answer him, I am with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him.
\v 16 With length of days I satisfy him, And I cause him to look on My salvation!
\c 92
\v 1 A Psalm. — A Song for the sabbath-day. Good to give thanks to Yahweh, And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High,
\v 2 To declare in the morning Your kindness, And Your faithfulness in the nights.
\v 3 On ten strings and on psaltery, On higgaion, with harp.
\v 4 For You hast caused me to rejoice, O Yahweh, in Your work, Concerning the works of Your hands I sing.
\v 5 How great have been Your works, O Yahweh, Very deep have been Your thoughts.
\v 6 A brutish man did not know, And a fool understandeth not this; — 
\v 7 When the wicked flourish as a herb, And blossom do all workers of iniquity — For their being destroyed for ever and ever!
\v 8 And You are high to the age, O Yahweh.
\v 9 For, behold, Thine enemies, O Yahweh, For, behold, Thine enemies, do perish, Separate themselves do all workers of iniquity.
\v 10 And You exaltest as a reem my horn, I have been anointed with fresh oil.
\v 11 And mine eye looketh on mine enemies, Of those rising up against me, The evil doers, do mine ears hear.
\v 12 The righteous as a palm-tree flourisheth, As a cedar in Lebanon he groweth.
\v 13 Those planted in the house of Yahweh, In the courts of our God do flourish.
\v 14 Still they bring forth in old age, Fat and flourishing are they,
\v 15 To declare that upright is Yahweh my rock, And there is no perverseness in Him!
\c 93
\v 1 Yahweh had reigned, Excellency He had put on, Yahweh put on strength, He girded Himself, Also — established is the world, unmoved.
\v 2 Established is Your throne since then, From the age You are.
\v 3 Floods have lifted up, O Yahweh, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.
\v 4 Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high is Yahweh,
\v 5 Your testimonies have been very stedfast, To Your house comely is holiness, O Yahweh, for length of days!
\c 94
\v 1 God of vengeance — Yahweh! God of vengeance, shine forth.
\v 2 Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud.
\v 3 Till when do the wicked, O Yahweh? Till when do the wicked exult?
\v 4 They utter — they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves.
\v 5 Your people, O Yahweh, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict.
\v 6 Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder.
\v 7 And they say, 'Yahweh did not see, And the God of Jacob did not consider.'
\v 8 Consider, you brutish among the people, And you foolish, when do you act wisely?
\v 9 He who planted the ear did He not hear? He who formed the eye did He not see?
\v 10 He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge is Yahweh.
\v 11 He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
\v 12 O the happiness of the man Whom You instructest, O Jah, And out of Your law teachest him,
\v 13 To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked.
\v 14 For Yahweh leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not.
\v 15 For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,
\v 16 Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?
\v 17 Unless Yahweh were a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence.
\v 18 If I have said, 'My foot had slipped,' Your kindness, O Yahweh, supporteth me.
\v 19 In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Your comforts delight my soul.
\v 20 Is a throne of mischief joined with Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?
\v 21 They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.
\v 22 And Yahweh is for a high place to me, And my God is for a rock — my refuge,
\v 23 And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Yahweh our God did cut them off!
\c 95
\v 1 Come, we sing to Yahweh, We shout to the rock of our salvation.
\v 2 We come before His face with thanksgiving, With psalms we shout to Him.
\v 3 For a great God is Yahweh, And a great king over all gods.
\v 4 In whose hand are the deep places of earth, And the strong places of hills are His.
\v 5 Whose is the sea, and He made it, And His hands formed the dry land.
\v 6 Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, We kneel before Yahweh our Maker.
\v 7 For He is our God, and we the people of His pasture, And the flock of His hand, To-day, if to His voice you hearken,
\v 8 Harden not your heart as in Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
\v 9 Where your fathers have tried Me, Have proved Me, yea, have seen My work.
\v 10 Forty years I am weary of the generation, And I say, 'A people erring in heart — they! And they have not known My ways:'
\v 11 Where I sware in Mine anger, 'If they come in unto My rest — !'
\c 96
\v 1 Sing to Yahweh a new song, Sing to Yahweh all the earth.
\v 2 Sing to Yahweh, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.
\v 3 Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.
\v 4 For great is Yahweh, and praised greatly, Fearful He is over all gods.
\v 5 For all the gods of the peoples are nought, And Yahweh made the heavens.
\v 6 Honour and majesty are before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.
\v 7 Ascribe to Yahweh, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Yahweh honour and strength.
\v 8 Ascribe to Yahweh the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.
\v 9 Bow yourselves to Yahweh, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.
\v 10 Say among nations, 'Yahweh had reigned, Also — established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.'
\v 11 The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.
\v 12 The field exulteth, and all that is in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,
\v 13 Before Yahweh, for He had come, For He had come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!
\c 97
\v 1 Yahweh had reigned, The earth is joyful, many isles rejoice.
\v 2 Cloud and darkness are round about Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.
\v 3 Fire before Him went, And burneth round about His adversaries.
\v 4 Lightened have His lightnings the world, The earth had seen, and is pained.
\v 5 Hills, like wax, melted before Yahweh, Before the Lord of all the earth.
\v 6 The heavens declared His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His honour.
\v 7 Ashamed are all servants of a graven image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all you gods.
\v 8 Zion had heard and rejoiceth, And daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Your judgments, O Yahweh.
\v 9 For You, Yahweh, are Most High over all the earth, Greatly You hast been exalted over all gods.
\v 10 Ye who love Yahweh, hate evil, He is keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he delivereth them.
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous, And for the upright of heart — joy.
\v 12 Rejoice, you righteous, in Yahweh, And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!
\c 98
\v 1 A Psalm. Sing you to Yahweh a new song, For wonders He had done, Given salvation to Him had His right hand and His holy arm.
\v 2 Yahweh had made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He had revealed His righteousness,
\v 3 He had remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\v 4 Shout to Yahweh, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.
\v 5 Sing to Yahweh with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,
\v 6 With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout you before the king Yahweh.
\v 7 Roar did the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
\v 8 Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,
\v 9 Before Yahweh, For He had come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!
\c 99
\v 1 Yahweh had reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.
\v 2 Yahweh in Zion is great, And high He is over all the peoples.
\v 3 They praise Your name, 'Great, and fearful, holy it is.'
\v 4 And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, You — You hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, You — You hast done.
\v 5 Exalt you Yahweh our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy is He.
\v 6 Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Yahweh, And He did answer them.
\v 7 In a pillar of cloud He spoke unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He had given to them.
\v 8 O Yahweh, our God, You hast afflicted them, A God forgiving You hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.
\v 9 Exalt you Yahweh our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy is Yahweh our God!
\c 100
\v 1 A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to Yahweh, all the earth.
\v 2 Serve Yahweh with joy, come before him with singing.
\v 3 Know that Yahweh He is God, He made us, and we are His, His people — and the flock of His pasture.
\v 4 Enter you His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give you thanks to Him, bless you His Name.
\v 5 For good is Yahweh, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
\c 101
\v 1 A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment I sing, To Thee, O Yahweh, I sing praise.
\v 2 I act wisely in a perfect way, When will You come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my heart, In the middle of my house.
\v 3 I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to me.
\v 4 A perverse heart turneth aside from me, Wickedness I know not.
\v 5 Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I endure not.
\v 6 Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth me.
\v 7 He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine eyes.
\v 8 At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, To cut off from the city of Yahweh All the workers of iniquity!
\c 102
\v 1 A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble, and before Yahweh poureth out his plaint. O Yahweh, hear my prayer, yea, my cry to Thee came.
\v 2 Hide not You Your face from me, In a day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call, haste, answer me.
\v 3 For consumed in smoke have been my days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.
\v 4 Smitten as the herb, and withered, is my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
\v 5 From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh.
\v 6 I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.
\v 7 I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the roof.
\v 8 All the day mine enemies reproached me, Those mad at me have sworn against me.
\v 9 Because ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping have mingled,
\v 10 From Thine indignation and Your wrath, For You hast lifted me up, And will cast me down.
\v 11 My days as a shadow are stretched out, And I — as the herb I am withered.
\v 12 And You, O Yahweh, to the age abidest, And Your memorial to all generations.
\v 13 You — You risest — You pitiest Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time had come.
\v 14 For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, And her dust they favour.
\v 15 And nations fear the name of Yahweh, And all kings of the earth Thine honour,
\v 16 For Yahweh had builded Zion, He had been seen in His honour,
\v 17 He turned unto the prayer of the destitute, And He had not despised their prayer.
\v 18 This is written for a later generation, And the people created do praise Jah.
\v 19 For He had looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Yahweh from heaven unto earth looked attentively,
\v 20 To hear the groan of the prisoner, To loose sons of death,
\v 21 To declare in Zion the name of Yahweh, And His praise in Jerusalem,
\v 22 In the peoples being gathered together, And the kingdoms — to serve Yahweh.
\v 23 He had humbled in the way my power, He had shortened my days.
\v 24 I say, 'My God, take me not up in the middle of my days,' Through all generations are Thine years.
\v 25 Beforetime the earth You did found, And the work of Your hands are the heavens.
\v 26 They — They perish, and You remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing You changest them, And they are changed.
\v 27 And You are the same, and Thine years are not finished.
\v 28 The sons of Your servants do continue, And their seed before Thee is established!
\c 103
\v 1 By David. Bless, O my soul, Yahweh, And all my inward parts — His Holy Name.
\v 2 Bless, O my soul, Yahweh, And forget not all His benefits,
\v 3 Who is forgiving all yours iniquities, Who is healing all your diseases,
\v 4 Who is redeeming from destruction your life, Who is crowning you — kindness and mercies,
\v 5 Who is satisfying with good your desire, Renew itself as an eagle did your youth.
\v 6 Yahweh is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.
\v 7 He made known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.
\v 8 Merciful and gracious is Yahweh, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.
\v 9 Not for ever did He strive, Nor to the age did He watch.
\v 10 Not according to our sins had He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.
\v 11 For, as the height of the heavens is above the earth, His kindness had been mighty over those fearing Him.
\v 12 As the distance of east from west He had put far from us our transgressions.
\v 13 As a father had mercy on sons, Yahweh had mercy on those fearing Him.
\v 14 For He had known our frame, Remembering that we are dust.
\v 15 Mortal man! as grass are his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;
\v 16 For a wind had passed over it, and it is not, And its place did not discern it any more.
\v 17 And the kindness of Yahweh Is from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons' sons,
\v 18 To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.
\v 19 Yahweh in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all had ruled.
\v 20 Bless Yahweh, you His messengers, Mighty in power — doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.
\v 21 Bless Yahweh, all you His hosts, His ministers — doing His pleasure.
\v 22 Bless Yahweh, all you His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Yahweh!
\c 104
\v 1 Bless, O my soul, Yahweh! Yahweh, my God, You hast been very great, Honour and majesty You hast put on.
\v 2 Covering himself with light as a garment, Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,
\v 3 Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on wings of wind,
\v 4 Making His messengers — the winds, His ministers — the flaming fire.
\v 5 He had founded earth on its bases, It is not moved to the age and for ever.
\v 6 The abyss! as with clothing You hast covered it, Above hills do waters stand.
\v 7 From Your rebuke they flee, From the voice of Your thunder haste away.
\v 8 They go up hills — they go down valleys, Unto a place You hast founded for them.
\v 9 A border You hast set, they pass not over, They turn not back to cover the earth.
\v 10 Who is sending forth fountains in valleys, Between hills they go on.
\v 11 They water every beast of the field, Wild asses break their thirst.
\v 12 By them the fowl of the heavens did dwell, From between the branches They give forth the voice.
\v 13 Watering hills from His upper chambers, From the fruit of Your works is the earth satisfied.
\v 14 Causing grass to spring up for cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the earth,
\v 15 And wine — it rejoiceth the heart of man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread — the heart of man it supporteth.
\v 16 Satisfied are the trees of Yahweh, Cedars of Lebanon that He had planted,
\v 17 Where birds do make nests, The stork — the firs are her house.
\v 18 The high hills are for wild goats, Rocks are a refuge for conies,
\v 19 He made the moon for seasons, The sun had known his place of entrance.
\v 20 You settest darkness, and it is night, In it did every beast of the forest creep.
\v 21 The young lions are roaring for prey, And to seek from God their food.
\v 22 The sun riseth, they are gathered, And in their dens they crouch.
\v 23 Man went forth to his work, And to his service — till evening.
\v 24 How many have been Your works, O Yahweh, All of them in wisdom You hast made, Full is the earth of your possessions.
\v 25 This, the sea, great and broad of sides, There are moving things — innumerable, Living creatures — small with great.
\v 26 There do ships go: leviathan, That You hast formed to play in it.
\v 27 All of them unto Thee do look, To give their food in its season.
\v 28 You will give to them — they gather, You will open Your hand — they are satisfied with good.
\v 29 You hidest Your face — they are troubled, You gatherest their spirit — they expire, And unto their dust they turn back.
\v 30 You sendest out Your Spirit, they are created, And You renewest the face of the ground.
\v 31 The honour of Yahweh is to the age, Yahweh rejoiceth in His works,
\v 32 Who is looking to earth, and it trembleth, He came against hills, and they smoke.
\v 33 I sing to Yahweh during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.
\v 34 Sweet is my meditation on Him, I — I do rejoice in Yahweh.
\v 35 Consumed are sinners from the earth, And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, Yahweh. Praise you Yahweh!
\c 105
\v 1 Give you thanks to Yahweh — call you in His name, Make known among the peoples His acts.
\v 2 Sing you to Him — sing praise to Him, Meditate you on all His wonders.
\v 3 Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The heart of those seeking Yahweh rejoiceth.
\v 4 Seek you Yahweh and His strength, Seek you His face continually.
\v 5 Remember His wonders that He did, His signs and the judgments of His mouth.
\v 6 O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
\v 7 He is Yahweh our God, In all the earth are His judgments.
\v 8 He had remembered to the age His covenant, The word He commanded to a thousand generations,
\v 9 That He had made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,
\v 10 And did establish it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel — a covenant age-during,
\v 11 Saying, 'To you I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,'
\v 12 In their being few in number, But a few, and sojourners in it.
\v 13 And they go up and down, from nation unto nation, From a kingdom unto another people.
\v 14 He had not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth for their sakes kings.
\v 15 'Strike not against Mine anointed, And to My prophets do not evil.'
\v 16 And He called a famine on the land, The whole staff of bread He had broken.
\v 17 He had sent before them a man, For a servant had Joseph been sold.
\v 18 They have afflicted with fetters his feet, Iron had entered his soul,
\v 19 Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of Yahweh had tried him.
\v 20 The king had sent, and looseth him, The ruler of the peoples, and draweth him out.
\v 21 He had made him lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions.
\v 22 To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And his elders he made wise.
\v 23 And Israel came in to Egypt, And Jacob had sojourned in the land of Ham.
\v 24 And He made His people very fruitful, And made it mightier than its adversaries.
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.
\v 26 He had sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had fixed on.
\v 27 They have set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.
\v 28 He had sent darkness, and it is dark, And they have not provoked His word.
\v 29 He had turned their waters to blood, And putteth to death their fish.
\v 30 Teemed had their land with frogs, In the inner chambers of their kings.
\v 31 He had said, and the beetle came, Lice into all their border.
\v 32 He had made their showers hail, A flaming fire is in their land.
\v 33 And He smiteth their vine and their fig, And shivereth the trees of their border.
\v 34 He had said, and the locust came, And the cankerworm — innumerable,
\v 35 And it consumeth every herb in their land, And it consumeth the fruit of their ground.
\v 36 And He smiteth every first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,
\v 37 And brought them out with silver and gold, And there is not in its tribes a feeble one.
\v 38 Rejoiced had Egypt in their going forth, For their fear had fallen upon them.
\v 39 He had spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to enlighten the night.
\v 40 They have asked, and He brought quails, And with bread of heaven satisfieth them.
\v 41 He had opened a rock, and waters issue, They have gone on in dry places — a river.
\v 42 For He had remembered His holy word, With Abraham His servant,
\v 43 And He brought forth His people with joy, With singing His chosen ones.
\v 44 And He gave to them the lands of nations, And the labour of peoples they possess,
\v 45 That they may observe His statutes, And His laws may keep. Praise you Yahweh!
\c 106
\v 1 Praise you Jah, give thanks to Yahweh, For good, for to the age, is His kindness.
\v 2 Who did utter the mighty acts of Yahweh? Soundeth all His praise?
\v 3 O the happiness of those keeping judgment, Doing righteousness at all times.
\v 4 Remember me, O Yahweh, With the favour of Your people, Look after me in Your salvation.
\v 5 To look on the good of Your chosen ones, To rejoice in the joy of Your nation, To boast myself with Thine inheritance.
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, We have done perversely, we have done wickedly.
\v 7 Our fathers in Egypt, Have not considered wisely Your wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of Your kind acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.
\v 8 And He saveth them for His name's sake, To make known His might,
\v 9 And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is dried up, And caused them to go Through depths as a wilderness.
\v 10 And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating, And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.
\v 11 And waters cover their adversaries, One of them had not been left.
\v 12 And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,
\v 13 They have hasted — forgotten His works, They have not waited for His counsel.
\v 14 And they lust greatly in a wilderness, And try God in a desert.
\v 15 And He gave to them their request, And sent leanness into their soul.
\v 16 And they are envious of Moses in the camp, Of Aaron, Yahweh's holy one.
\v 17 Earth opened, and swalloweth up Dathan, And covereth over the company of Abiram.
\v 18 And fire burneth among their company, A flame setteth on fire the wicked.
\v 19 They make a calf in Horeb, And bow themselves to a molten image,
\v 20 And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating herbs.
\v 21 They have forgotten God their saviour, The doer of great things in Egypt,
\v 22 Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, Of fearful things by the sea of Suph.
\v 23 And He said to destroy them, Unless Moses, His chosen one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back His wrath from destroying.
\v 24 And they kick against the desirable land, They have not given credence to His word.
\v 25 And they murmur in their tents, They have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh.
\v 26 And He lifteth up His hand to them, To cause them to fall in a wilderness,
\v 27 And to cause their seed to fall among nations, And to scatter them through lands.
\v 28 And they are coupled to Baal-Peor, And eat the sacrifices of the dead,
\v 29 And they provoke to anger by their actions, And a plague breaketh forth upon them,
\v 30 And Phinehas standeth, and executeth judgment, And the plague is restrained,
\v 31 And it is reckoned to him to righteousness, To all generations — unto the age.
\v 32 And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,
\v 33 For they have provoked his spirit, And he spoke wrongfully with his lips.
\v 34 They have not destroyed the peoples, As Yahweh had said to them,
\v 35 And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,
\v 36 And serve their idols, And they are to them for a snare.
\v 37 And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to destroyers,
\v 38 And they shed innocent blood — Blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.
\v 39 And they are defiled with their works, And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.
\v 40 And the anger of Yahweh Is kindled against His people, And He did abominate His inheritance.
\v 41 And gave them into the hand of nations, And those hating them rule over them,
\v 42 And their enemies oppress them, And they are humbled under their hand.
\v 43 Many times He did deliver them, And they rebel in their counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.
\v 44 And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their cry,
\v 45 And remembered for them His covenant, And is comforted, According to the abundance of His kindness.
\v 46 And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their captors.
\v 47 Save us, O Yahweh our God, and gather us from the nations, To give thanks to Your holy name, To glory in Your praise.
\v 48 Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, From the age even unto the age. And all the people said, 'Amen, praise Jah!'
\c 107
\v 1 Give you thanks to Yahweh, For good, for to the age is His kindness:'
\v 2 Let the redeemed of Yahweh say, Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.
\v 3 And from the lands had gathered them, From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.
\v 4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.
\v 5 Hungry — yea — thirsty, Their soul in them became feeble,
\v 6 And they cry unto Yahweh in their adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,
\v 7 And caused them to tread in a right way, To go unto a city of habitation.
\v 8 They confess to Yahweh His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.
\v 9 For He had satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul had filled with goodness.
\v 10 Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,
\v 11 Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.
\v 12 And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.
\v 13 And they cry unto Yahweh in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.
\v 14 He brought them out from the dark place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.
\v 15 They confess to Yahweh His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.
\v 16 For He had broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He had cut.
\v 17 Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.
\v 18 All food did their soul abominate, And they come nigh unto the gates of death,
\v 19 And cry unto Yahweh in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,
\v 20 He sent His word and healeth them, And delivereth from their destructions.
\v 21 They confess to Yahweh His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,
\v 22 And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.
\v 23 Those going down to the sea in ships, Doing business in many waters,
\v 24 They have seen the works of Yahweh, And His wonders in the deep.
\v 25 And He said, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,
\v 26 They go up to the heavens, they go down to the depths, Their soul in evil is melted.
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
\v 28 And they cry to Yahweh in their adversity, And from their distresses He brought them out.
\v 29 He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are their billows.
\v 30 And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.
\v 31 They confess to Yahweh His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,
\v 32 And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.
\v 33 He made rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of waters become dry land.
\v 34 A fruitful land became a barren place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.
\v 35 He made a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.
\v 36 And He caused the hungry to dwell there, And they prepare a city of habitation.
\v 37 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.
\v 38 And He blessed them, and they multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He did not diminish.
\v 39 And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.
\v 40 He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And caused them to wander in vacancy — no way.
\v 41 And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And placeth families as a flock.
\v 42 The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity had shut her mouth.
\v 43 Who is wise, and observeth these? They understand the kind acts of Yahweh!
\c 108
\v 1 A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.
\v 2 Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.
\v 3 I thank Thee among peoples, O Yahweh, And I praise Thee among the nations.
\v 4 For great above the heavens is Your kindness, And unto the clouds Your truth.
\v 5 Be You exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Your honour.
\v 6 That Your beloved ones may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and answer us.
\v 7 God had spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
\v 8 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, And Ephraim is the strength of my head, Judah is my lawgiver,
\v 9 Moab is a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.
\v 10 Who did bring me in to the fenced city? Who had led me unto Edom?
\v 11 Hast not You, O God, cast us off? And You goest not out, O God, with our hosts!
\v 12 Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.
\v 13 In God we do mightily, And He did tread down our adversaries!
\c 109
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, be not silent,
\v 2 For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me — A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!
\v 3 They have compassed me about, And they fight me without cause.
\v 4 For my love they oppose me, and I — prayer!
\v 5 And they set against me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
\v 6 Appoint You over him the wicked, And an adversary standeth at his right hand.
\v 7 In his being judged, he went forth wicked, And his prayer is for sin.
\v 8 His days are few, his oversight another took,
\v 9 His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\v 10 And wander continually do his sons, Yea, they have begged, And have sought out of their dry places.
\v 11 An exactor laid a snare for all that he had, And strangers spoil his labour.
\v 12 He had none to extend kindness, Nor is there one showing favour to his orphans.
\v 13 His posterity is for cutting off, In another generation is their name blotted out.
\v 14 The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Yahweh, And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.
\v 15 They are before Yahweh continually, And He cutteth off from earth their memorial.
\v 16 Because that he had not remembered to do kindness, And pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of heart — to slay,
\v 17 And he loveth reviling, and it meeteth him, And he had not delighted in blessing, And it is far from him.
\v 18 And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it came in as water into his middle, And as oil into his bones.
\v 19 It is to him as apparel — he covereth himself, And for a continual girdle he girdeth it on.
\v 20 This is the wage of mine accusers from Yahweh, And of those speaking evil against my soul.
\v 21 And You, O Yahweh Lord, Deal with me for Your name's sake, Because Your kindness is good, deliver me.
\v 22 For I am poor and needy, And my heart had been pierced in my middle.
\v 23 As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone, I have been driven away as a locust.
\v 24 My knees have been feeble from fasting, And my flesh had failed of fatness.
\v 25 And I — I have been a reproach to them, They see me, they shake their head.
\v 26 Help me, O Yahweh my God, Save me, according to Your kindness.
\v 27 And they know that this is Your hand, You, O Yahweh, You hast done it.
\v 28 They revile, and You will bless, They have risen, and are ashamed, And Your servant did rejoice.
\v 29 Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an upper robe is their shame.
\v 30 I thank Yahweh greatly with my mouth, And in the middle of many I praise Him,
\v 31 For He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save from those judging his soul.
\c 110
\v 1 A Psalm of David. The affirmation of Yahweh to my Lord: 'Sit at My right hand, Till I make yours enemies your footstool.'
\v 2 The rod of your strength did Yahweh send from Zion, Rule in the middle of yours enemies.
\v 3 Your people are free-will gifts in the day of Your strength, in the honours of holiness, From the womb, from the morning, You hast the dew of your youth.
\v 4 Yahweh had sworn, and did not repent, 'You are a priest to the age, According to the order of Melchizedek.'
\v 5 The Lord on your right hand smote kings In the day of His anger.
\v 6 He did judge among the nations, He had completed the carcases, Hath smitten the head over the mighty earth.
\v 7 From a brook in the way he drinketh, Therefore he did lift up the head!
\c 111
\v 1 Praise you Jah! I thank Yahweh with the whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.
\v 2 Great are the works of Yahweh, Sought out by all desiring them.
\v 3 Honourable and majestic is His work, And His righteousness is standing for ever.
\v 4 A memorial He had made of His wonders, Gracious and merciful is Yahweh.
\v 5 Prey He had given to those fearing Him, He remembered to the age His covenant.
\v 6 The power of His works He had declared to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.
\v 7 The works of His hands are true and just, Stedfast are all His appointments.
\v 8 They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness.
\v 9 Redemption He had sent to His people, He had appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful is His name.
\v 10 The beginning of wisdom is fear of Yahweh, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise is standing for ever!
\c 112
\v 1 Praise you Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Yahweh, In His commands he had delighted greatly.
\v 2 Mighty in the earth is his seed, The generation of the upright is blessed.
\v 3 Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness is standing for ever.
\v 4 Light had risen in darkness to the upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
\v 5 Good is the man — gracious and lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.
\v 6 For — to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous.
\v 7 Of an evil report he is not afraid, Prepared is His heart, confident in Yahweh.
\v 8 Sustained is his heart — he feareth not, Till that he look on his adversaries.
\v 9 He had scattered — had given to the needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with honour.
\v 10 The wicked saw, and had been angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and had melted, The desire of the wicked did perish!
\c 113
\v 1 Praise you Jah! Praise, you servants of Yahweh. Praise the name of Yahweh.
\v 2 The name of Yahweh is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age.
\v 3 From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised is the name of Yahweh.
\v 4 High above all nations is Yahweh, Above the heavens is his honour.
\v 5 Who is as Yahweh our God, He is exalting Himself to sit?
\v 6 He is humbling Himself to look On the heavens and on the earth.
\v 7 He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.
\v 8 To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.
\v 9 Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise you Jah!
\c 114
\v 1 In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,
\v 2 Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
\v 3 The sea had seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.
\v 4 The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.
\v 5 What — to you, O sea, that you fleest? O Jordan, you turnest back!
\v 6 O mountains, you skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!
\v 7 From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,
\v 8 He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!
\c 115
\v 1 Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, But to Your name give honour, For Your kindness, for Your truth.
\v 2 Why do the nations say, 'Where, pray, is their God.
\v 3 And our God is in the heavens, All that He had pleased He had done.
\v 4 Their idols are silver and gold, work of man's hands,
\v 5 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
\v 6 Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,
\v 7 Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;
\v 8 Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
\v 9 O Israel, trust in Yahweh, 'Their help and their shield is He.'
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust in Yahweh, 'Their help and their shield is He.'
\v 11 Ye fearing Yahweh, trust in Yahweh, 'Their help and their shield is He.'
\v 12 Yahweh had remembered us, He blessed, He blessed the house of Israel, He blessed the house of Aaron,
\v 13 He blessed those fearing Yahweh, The small with the great.
\v 14 Yahweh addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.
\v 15 Blessed are you of Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth,
\v 16 The heavens — the heavens are Yahweh's, And the earth He had given to sons of men,
\v 17 The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.
\v 18 And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise you Jah!
\c 116
\v 1 I have loved, because Yahweh heareth My voice, my supplication,
\v 2 Because He had inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.
\v 3 Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.
\v 4 And in the name of Yahweh I call: I pray Thee, O Yahweh, deliver my soul,
\v 5 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous, Yea, our God is merciful,
\v 6 A preserver of the simple is Yahweh, I was low, and to me He gave salvation.
\v 7 Turn back, O my soul, to your rest, For Yahweh had conferred benefits on you.
\v 8 For You hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.
\v 9 I walk habitually before Yahweh In the lands of the living.
\v 10 I have believed, for I speak, I — I have been afflicted greatly.
\v 11 I said in my haste, 'Every man is a liar.'
\v 12 What do I return to Yahweh? All His benefits are upon me.
\v 13 The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Yahweh I call.
\v 14 My vows to Yahweh let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.
\v 15 Precious in the eyes of Yahweh is the death for His saints.
\v 16 Cause it to come, O Yahweh, for I am Your servant. I am Your servant, son of Your handmaid, You hast opened my bonds.
\v 17 To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Yahweh I call.
\v 18 My vows to Yahweh let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,
\v 19 In the courts of the house of Yahweh, In your middle, O Jerusalem, praise you Jah!
\c 117
\v 1 Praise Yahweh, all you nations, Glorify Him, all you peoples.
\v 2 For mighty to us had been His kindness, And the truth of Yahweh is to the age. Praise you Jah!
\c 118
\v 1 Give you thanks to Yahweh, For good, for to the age is His kindness.
\v 2 I pray you, let Israel say, That, to the age is His kindness.
\v 3 I pray you, let the house of Aaron say, That, to the age is His kindness.
\v 4 I pray you, let those fearing Yahweh say, That, to the age is His kindness.
\v 5 From the straitness I called Jah, Jah answered me in a broad place.
\v 6 Yahweh is for me, I do not fear what man did to me.
\v 7 Yahweh is for me among my helpers, And I — I look on those hating me.
\v 8 Better to take refuge in Yahweh than to trust in man,
\v 9 Better to take refuge in Yahweh, Than to trust in princes.
\v 10 All nations have compassed me about, In the name of Yahweh I surely cut them off.
\v 11 They have compassed me about, Yea, they have compassed me about, In the name of Yahweh I surely cut them off.
\v 12 They compassed me about as bees, They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, In the name of Yahweh I surely cut them off.
\v 13 You hast sorely thrust me to fall, And Yahweh had helped me.
\v 14 My strength and song is Jah, And He is to me for salvation.
\v 15 A voice of singing and salvation, Is in the tents of the righteous, The right hand of Yahweh is doing valiantly.
\v 16 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted, The right hand of Yahweh is doing valiantly.
\v 17 I do not die, but live, And recount the works of Jah,
\v 18 Jah had sorely chastened me, And to death had not given me up.
\v 19 Open you to me gates of righteousness, I enter into them — I thank Jah.
\v 20 This is the gate to Yahweh, The righteous enter into it.
\v 21 I thank Thee, for You hast answered me, And are to me for salvation.
\v 22 A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner.
\v 23 From Yahweh had this been, It is wonderful in our eyes,
\v 24 This is the day Yahweh had made, We rejoice and are glad in it.
\v 25 I beseech Thee, O Yahweh, save, I pray Thee, I beseech Thee, O Yahweh, prosper, I pray Thee.
\v 26 Blessed is he who is coming In the name of Yahweh, We blessed you from the house of Yahweh,
\v 27 God is Yahweh, and He gave to us light, Direct you the festal-sacrifice with cords, Unto the horns of the altar.
\v 28 My God You are, and I confess Thee, My God, I exalt Thee.
\v 29 Give you thanks to Yahweh, For good, for to the age, is His kindness!
\c 119
\v 1 Aleph. O the happiness of those perfect in the way, They are walking in the law of Yahweh,
\v 2 O the happiness of those keeping His testimonies, With the whole heart they seek Him.
\v 3 Yea, they have not done iniquity, In His ways they have walked.
\v 4 You hast commanded us Your precepts to keep diligently,
\v 5 O that my ways were prepared to keep Your statutes,
\v 6 Then I am not ashamed In my looking unto all Your commands.
\v 7 I confess Thee with uprightness of heart, In my learning the judgments of Your righteousness.
\v 8 Your statutes I keep, leave me not utterly!
\v 9 Beth. With what did a young man purify his path? To observe — according to Your word.
\v 10 With all my heart I have sought Thee, Let me not err from Your commands.
\v 11 In my heart I have hid Your saying, That I sin not before Thee.
\v 12 Blessed are You, O Yahweh, teach me Your statutes.
\v 13 With my lips I have recounted All the judgments of Your mouth.
\v 14 In the way of Your testimonies I have joyed, As over all wealth.
\v 15 In Your precepts I meditate, And I behold attentively Your paths.
\v 16 In Your statutes I delight myself, I do not forget Your word.
\v 17 Gimel. Confer benefits on Your servant, I live, and I keep Your word.
\v 18 Uncover mine eyes, and I behold wonders out of Your law.
\v 19 A sojourner I am on earth, Hide not from me Your commands.
\v 20 Broken had my soul for desire Unto Your judgments at all times.
\v 21 You hast rebuked the cursed proud, Who are erring from Your commands.
\v 22 Remove from me reproach and contempt, For Your testimonies I have kept.
\v 23 Princes also sat — against me they spoke, Your servant did meditate in Your statutes,
\v 24 Your testimonies also are my delight, The men of my counsel!
\v 25 Daleth. Cleaved to the dust had my soul, Quicken me according to Your word.
\v 26 My ways I have recounted, And You answerest me, teach me Your statutes,
\v 27 The way of Your precepts cause me to understand, And I meditate in Your wonders.
\v 28 My soul had dropped from affliction, Establish me according to Your word.
\v 29 The way of falsehood turn aside from me And with Your law favour me.
\v 30 The way of faithfulness I have chosen, Your judgments I have compared,
\v 31 I have adhered to Your testimonies, O Yahweh, put me not to shame.
\v 32 The way of Your commands I run, For You will enlarge my heart!
\v 33 He. Show me, O Yahweh, the way of Your statutes, And I keep it — to the end.
\v 34 Cause me to understand, and I keep Your law, And observe it with the whole heart.
\v 35 Cause me to tread in the path of Your commands, For in it I have delighted.
\v 36 Incline my heart unto Your testimonies, And not unto dishonest gain.
\v 37 Remove mine eyes from seeing vanity, In Your way quicken You me.
\v 38 Establish to Your servant Your saying, That is concerning Your fear.
\v 39 Remove my reproach that I have feared, For Your judgments are good.
\v 40 Lo, I have longed for Your precepts, In Your righteousness quicken You me,
\v 41 Waw. And meet me did Your kindness, O Yahweh, Your salvation according to Your saying.
\v 42 And I answer him who is reproaching me a word, For I have trusted in Your word.
\v 43 And You takest not utterly away From my mouth the word of truth, Because for Your judgment I have hoped.
\v 44 And I keep Your law continually, To the age and for ever.
\v 45 And I walk habitually in a broad place, For Your precepts I have sought.
\v 46 And I speak of Your testimonies before kings, And I am not ashamed.
\v 47 And I delight myself in Your commands, That I have loved,
\v 48 And I lift up my hands unto Your commands, That I have loved, And I do meditate on Your statutes!
\v 49 Zain. Remember the word to Your servant, On which You hast caused me to hope.
\v 50 This is my comfort in mine affliction, That Your saying had quickened me.
\v 51 The proud have utterly scorned me, From Your law I have not turned aside.
\v 52 I remembered Your judgments of old, O Yahweh, And I comfort myself.
\v 53 Horror had seized me, Because of the wicked forsaking Your law.
\v 54 Songs have been to me Your statutes, In the house of my sojournings.
\v 55 I have remembered in the night Your name, O Yahweh, And I do keep Your law.
\v 56 This had been to me, That Your precepts I have kept!
\v 57 Cheth. My portion is Yahweh; I have said — to keep Your words,
\v 58 I appeased Your face with the whole heart, Favour me according to Your saying.
\v 59 I have reckoned my ways, And turn back my feet unto Your testimonies.
\v 60 I have made haste, And delayed not, to keep Your commands.
\v 61 Cords of the wicked have surrounded me, Your law I have not forgotten.
\v 62 At midnight I rise to give thanks to Thee, For the judgments of Your righteousness.
\v 63 A companion I am to all who fear Thee, And to those keeping Your precepts.
\v 64 Of Your kindness, O Yahweh, the earth is full, Your statutes teach You me!
\v 65 Teth. Good You did with Your servant, O Yahweh, According to Your word.

\v 69 Forged against me falsehood have the proud, I with the whole heart keep Your precepts.
\v 70 Insensate as fat had been their heart, I — in Your law I have delighted.
\v 71 Good for me that I have been afflicted, That I might learn Your statutes.

\v 80 My heart is perfect in Your statutes, So that I am not ashamed.
\v 81 Kaph. Consumed for Your salvation had been my soul, For Your word I have hoped.
\v 82 Consumed have been mine eyes for Your word, Saying, 'When did it comfort me?'
\v 83 For I have been as a bottle in smoke, Your statutes I have not forgotten.
\v 84 How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute Against my pursuers judgment?
\v 85 The proud have digged for me pits, That are not according to Your law.
\v 86 All Your commands are faithfulness, With falsehood they have pursued me, Help You me.

\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. Unto Yahweh in my distress I have called, And He answereth me.
\v 2 O Yahweh, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!
\v 3 What did He give to you? And what did He add to you? O deceitful tongue!
\v 4 Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals.
\v 5 Woe to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.
\v 6 Too much had my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.
\v 7 I am peace, and when I speak they are for war!
\c 121
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence did my help come?
\v 2 My help is from Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth,
\v 3 He suffereth not your foot to be moved, Your preserver slumbereth not.
\v 4 Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.
\v 5 Yahweh is your preserver, Yahweh is your shade on your right hand,
\v 6 By day the sun did not smite you, Nor the moon by night.
\v 7 Yahweh preserveth you from all evil, He did preserve your soul.
\v 8 Yahweh preserveth your going out and your coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!
\c 122
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, 'To the house of Yahweh we go.'
\v 2 Our feet have been standing in your gates, O Jerusalem!
\v 3 Jerusalem — the builded one — Is as a city that is joined to itself together.
\v 4 For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
\v 5 For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.
\v 6 Ask you the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving you.
\v 7 Peace is in your bulwark, rest in your high places,
\v 8 For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray you, 'Peace be in you.'
\v 9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I seek good for you!
\c 123
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.
\v 2 Lo, as eyes of men-servants Are unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant Are unto the hand of her mistress, So are our eyes unto Yahweh our God, Till that He did favour us.
\v 3 Favour us, O Yahweh, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,
\v 4 Greatly had our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!
\c 124
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save for Yahweh — who had been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),
\v 2 Save for Yahweh — who had been for us, In the rising up of man against us,
\v 3 Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,
\v 4 Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,
\v 5 Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.
\v 6 Blessed is Yahweh who had not given us, A prey to their teeth.
\v 7 Our soul as a bird had escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
\v 8 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, Maker of the heavens and earth!
\c 125
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. Those trusting in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, It is not moved — to the age it abideth.
\v 2 Jerusalem! mountains are round about her, And Yahweh is round about His people, From henceforth even unto the age.
\v 3 For the rod of wickedness rested not On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands.
\v 4 Do good, O Yahweh, to the good, And to the upright in their hearts.
\v 5 As to those turning to their crooked ways, Yahweh caused them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!
\c 126
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. In Yahweh's turning back to the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.
\v 2 Then filled with laughter is our mouth, And our tongue with singing, Then do they say among nations, 'Yahweh did great things with these.'
\v 3 Yahweh did great things with us, We have been joyful.
\v 4 Turn again, O Yahweh, to our captivity, As streams in the south.
\v 5 Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,
\v 6 Whoso went on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely came in with singing, bearing his sheaves!
\c 127
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents, by Solomon. If Yahweh did not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at it, If Yahweh did not watch a city, In vain had a watchman waked.
\v 2 Vain for you who are rising early, Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He gave to His beloved one sleep.
\v 3 Lo, an inheritance of Yahweh are sons, A reward is the fruit of the womb.
\v 4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, So are the sons of the young men.
\v 5 O the happiness of the man Who had filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with enemies in the gate!
\c 128
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. O the happiness of every one fearing Yahweh, Who is walking in His ways.
\v 2 The labour of your hands you surely eatest, Happy are you, and good is to you.
\v 3 Your wife is as a fruitful vine in the sides of your house, Your sons as olive plants around your table.
\v 4 Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing Yahweh.
\v 5 Yahweh did bless you out of Zion, Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of your life,
\v 6 And see the sons of your sons! Peace on Israel!
\c 129
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:
\v 2 Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.
\v 3 Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.
\v 4 Yahweh is righteous, He had cut asunder cords of the wicked.
\v 5 Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.
\v 6 They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,
\v 7 That had not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.
\v 8 And the passers by have not said, 'The blessing of Yahweh is on you, We blessed you in the Name of Yahweh!'
\c 130
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Yahweh.
\v 2 Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.
\v 3 If iniquities You will observe, O Lord, who did stand?
\v 4 But with Thee is forgiveness, that You may be feared.
\v 5 I hoped for Yahweh — hoped had my soul, And for His word I have waited.
\v 6 My soul is for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!
\v 7 Israel did wait on Yahweh, For with Yahweh is kindness, And abundant with Him is redemption.
\v 8 And He did redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
\c 131
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents, by David. Yahweh, my heart had not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high, Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me.
\v 2 Have I not compared, and kept silent my soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me is my soul.
\v 3 Israel did wait on Yahweh, From henceforth, and unto the age!
\c 132
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. Remember, Yahweh, for David, all his afflictions.
\v 2 Who had sworn to Yahweh. He had vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
\v 3 'If I enter into the tent of my house, If I go up on the couch of my bed,
\v 4 If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine eyelids — slumber,
\v 5 Till I do find a place for Yahweh, Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob.
\v 6 'Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We have found it in the fields of the forest.
\v 7 We come in to His tabernacles, We bow ourselves at His footstool.
\v 8 Arise, O Yahweh, to Your rest, You, and the ark of Your strength,
\v 9 Your priests do put on righteousness, And Your pious ones cry aloud.
\v 10 For the sake of David Your servant, Turn not back the face of Thine anointed.
\v 11 Yahweh had sworn truth to David, He turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of your body, I set on the throne for you.
\v 12 If your sons keep My covenant, And My testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit on the throne for you.
\v 13 For Yahweh had fixed on Zion, He had desired it for a seat to Himself,
\v 14 This is My rest for ever and ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it.
\v 15 Her provision I greatly bless, Her needy ones I satisfy with bread,
\v 16 And her priests I clothe with salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud.
\v 17 There I cause to spring up a horn for David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed.
\v 18 His enemies I do clothe with shame, And upon him did his crown flourish!
\c 133
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents, by David. Lo, how good and how pleasant The dwelling of brethren — even together!
\v 2 As the good oil on the head, Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, That came down on the skirt of his robes,
\v 3 As dew of Hermon — That came down on hills of Zion, For there Yahweh commanded the blessing — Life unto the age!
\c 134
\v 1 A Song of the Ascents. Lo, bless Yahweh, all servants of Yahweh, Who are standing in the house of Yahweh by night.
\v 2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, And bless you Yahweh.
\v 3 Yahweh did bless you out of Zion, The maker of the heavens and earth!
\c 135
\v 1 Praise you Jah! Praise you the name of Yahweh, Praise, you servants of Yahweh,
\v 2 Who are standing in the house of Yahweh, In the courts of the house of our God.
\v 3 Praise you Jah! for Yahweh is good, Sing praise to His name, for it is pleasant.
\v 4 For Jacob had Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.
\v 5 For I have known that great is Yahweh, Yea, our Lord is above all gods.
\v 6 All that Yahweh pleased He had done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,
\v 7 Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He had made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.
\v 8 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.
\v 9 He sent tokens and wonders into your middle, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.
\v 10 Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,
\v 11 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.
\v 12 And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,
\v 13 O Yahweh, Your name is to the age, O Yahweh, Your memorial to all generations.
\v 14 For Yahweh did judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.
\v 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.
\v 16 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
\v 17 Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose — there is no breath in their mouth!
\v 18 Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
\v 19 O house of Israel, bless you Yahweh, O house of Aaron, bless you Yahweh,
\v 20 O house of Levi, bless you Yahweh, Those fearing Yahweh, bless you Yahweh.
\v 21 Blessed is Yahweh from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem — praise you Jah!

\v 23 Who in our lowliness had remembered us, For to the age is His kindness.
\v 24 And He delivereth us from our adversaries, For to the age is His kindness.
\v 25 Giving food to all flesh, For to the age is His kindness.
\v 26 Give you thanks to the God of the heavens, For to the age is His kindness!

\v 1 By rivers of Babylon — There we did sit, Yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.
\v 2 On willows in its middle we hung our harps.
\v 3 For there our captors asked us the words of a song, And our spoilers — joy: 'Sing you to us of a song of Zion.'
\v 4 How do we sing the song of Yahweh, On the land of a stranger?
\v 5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, my right hand forgetteth!
\v 6 My tongue did cleave to my palate, If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.
\v 7 Remember, Yahweh, for the sons of Edom, The day of Jerusalem, Those saying, 'Rase, rase to its foundation!'
\v 8 O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one, O the happiness of him who repayeth to you your deed, That you hast done to us.
\v 9 O the happiness of him who did seize, And had dashed your sucklings on the rock!

\v 1 By David. I confess Thee, with all my heart, Before the gods I do praise Thee.
\v 2 I bow myself toward Your holy temple, And I confess Your name, For Your kindness, and for Your truth, For You hast made great Your saying above all Your name.
\v 3 In the day I called, when You will answer me, You will strengthen me in my soul with strength.
\v 4 O Yahweh, all kings of earth confess Thee, When they have heard the sayings of Your mouth.
\v 5 And they sing in the ways of Yahweh, For great is the honour of Yahweh.
\v 6 For high is Yahweh, and the lowly He saw, And the haughty from afar He knoweth.
\v 7 If I walk in the middle of distress You quickenest me, Against the anger of mine enemies You sendest forth Your hand, And Your right hand did save me.
\v 8 Yahweh did perfect for me, O Yahweh, Your kindness is to the age, The works of Your hands let not fall!
\c 139
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm by David. Yahweh, You hast searched me, and knowest.
\v 2 You — You hast known my sitting down, And my rising up, You hast attended to my thoughts from afar.
\v 3 My path and my couch You hast fanned, And with all my ways hast been acquainted.
\v 4 For there is not a word in my tongue, Lo, O Yahweh, You hast known it all!
\v 5 Behind and before You hast besieged me, And You will place on me Your hand.
\v 6 Knowledge too wonderful for me, It had been set on high, I am not able for it.
\v 7 Whither do I go from Your Spirit? And where from Your face do I flee?
\v 8 If I ascend the heavens — there You are, And spread out a couch in Sheol, behold, Thee!
\v 9 I take the wings of morning, I dwell in the uttermost part of the sea,
\v 10 Also there Your hand did lead me, And Your right hand did hold me.
\v 11 And I say, 'Surely darkness bruiseth me, Then night is light to me.
\v 12 Also darkness hideth not from Thee, And night as day shineth, as is darkness so is light.
\v 13 For You — You hast possessed my reins, You will cover me in my mother's belly.
\v 14 I confess Thee, because that with wonders I have been distinguished. Wonderful are Your works, And my soul is knowing it well.
\v 15 My substance was not hid from Thee, When I was made in secret, Curiously wrought in the lower part of earth.
\v 16 Mine unformed substance Thine eyes saw, And on Your book all of them are written, The days they were formed — And not one among them.
\v 17 And to me how precious have been Your thoughts, O God, how great had been their sum!
\v 18 I recount them! than the sand they are more, I have waked, and I am still with Thee.
\v 19 Dost You slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood, turn aside from me!
\v 20 Who exchange Thee for wickedness, Lifted up to vanity are Thine enemies.
\v 21 Do not I hate, Yahweh, those hating Thee? And with Your withstanders grieve myself?
\v 22 With perfect hatred I have hated them, Enemies they have become to me.
\v 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my thoughts,
\v 24 And see if a grievous way be in me, And lead me in a way age-during!
\c 140
\v 1 To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Yahweh, from an evil man, From one of violence You keepest me.
\v 2 Who have devised evils in the heart, All the day they assemble for wars.
\v 3 They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, Poison of an adder is under their lips. Selah.
\v 4 Preserve me, Yahweh, from the hands of the wicked, From one of violence You keepest me, Who have devised to overthrow my steps.
\v 5 The proud hid a snare for me — and cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set for me. Selah.
\v 6 I have said to Yahweh, 'My God are You, Hear, Yahweh, the voice of my supplications.'
\v 7 O Yahweh, my Lord, strength of my salvation, You hast covered my head in the day of armour.
\v 8 Grant not, O Yahweh, the desires of the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.
\v 9 The chief of my surrounders, The perverseness of their lips covereth them.
\v 10 They cause to fall on themselves burning coals, Into fire He did cast them, Into deep pits — they arise not.
\v 11 A talkative man is not established in the earth, One of violence — evil hunteth to overflowing.
\v 12 I have known that Yahweh did execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.
\v 13 Only — the righteous give thanks to Your name, The upright do dwell with Your presence!
\c 141
\v 1 A Psalm, by David. O Yahweh, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear to my voice when I call to Thee.
\v 2 My prayer is prepared — incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands — the evening present.
\v 3 Set, O Yahweh, a watch for my mouth, Watch You over the door of my lips.
\v 4 Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.
\v 5 The righteous did beat me in kindness. And did reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer is about their vexations.
\v 6 Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant.
\v 7 As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.
\v 8 But to Thee, O Yahweh, my Lord, are mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul.
\v 9 Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity.
\v 10 The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!
\c 142
\v 1 An Instruction of David, a Prayer when he is in the cave. My voice is unto Yahweh, I cry, My voice is unto Yahweh, I entreat grace.
\v 2 I pour forth before Him my meditation, My distress before Him I declare.
\v 3 When my spirit had been feeble in me, Then You hast known my path; In the way in which I walk, They have hid a snare for me.
\v 4 Looking on the right hand — and seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished had refuge from me, There is none inquiring for my soul.
\v 5 I have cried unto you, O Yahweh, I have said, 'You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.'
\v 6 Attend You unto my loud cry, For I have become very low, Deliver You me from my pursuers, For they have been stronger than I.
\v 7 Bring forth from prison my soul to confess Your name, The righteous do compass me about, When You conferrest benefits upon me!
\c 143
\v 1 A Psalm of David. O Yahweh, hear my prayer, Give ear unto my supplications, In Your faithfulness answer me — in Your righteousness.
\v 2 And enter not into judgment with Your servant, For no one living is justified before Thee.
\v 3 For an enemy had pursued my soul, He had bruised to the earth my life, He had caused me to dwell in dark places, As the dead of old.
\v 4 And my spirit in me is become feeble, Within me is my heart become desolate.
\v 5 I have remembered days of old, I have meditated on all Thine acts, On the work of Your hand I muse.
\v 6 I have spread forth my hands unto Thee, My soul is as a weary land for Thee. Selah.
\v 7 Haste, answer me, O Yahweh, My spirit had been consumed, Hide not You Your face from me, Or I have been compared with those going down to the pit.
\v 8 Cause me to hear in the morning Your kindness, For in Thee I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I go, For unto Thee I have lifted up my soul.
\v 9 Deliver me from mine enemies, O Yahweh, Near Thee I am covered.
\v 10 Teach me to do Your good pleasure, For You are my God — Your Spirit is good, Lead me into a land of uprightness.
\v 11 For Your name's sake O Yahweh, You will quicken me, In Your righteousness, You bringest out from distress my soul,
\v 12 And in Your kindness cuttest off mine enemies, And hast destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I am Your servant!
\c 144
\v 1 By David. Blessed is Yahweh my rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.
\v 2 My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower, and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing my people under me!
\v 3 Yahweh, what is man that You knowest him? Son of man, that You esteemest him?
\v 4 Man to vanity had been like, His days are as a shadow passing by.
\v 5 Yahweh, incline Your heavens and come down, Strike against mountains, and they smoke.
\v 6 Send forth lightning, and scatter them, Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,
\v 7 Send forth Your hand from on high, Free me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a stranger,
\v 8 Because their mouth had spoken vanity, And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
\v 9 O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.
\v 10 Who is giving deliverance to kings, Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.
\v 11 Free me, and deliver me From the hand of sons of a stranger, Because their mouth had spoken vanity, And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood,
\v 12 Because our sons are as plants, Becoming great in their youth, Our daughters as hewn stones, Polished — the likeness of a palace,
\v 13 Our garners are full, bringing out from kind to kind, Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, Ten thousands in our out-places,
\v 14 Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad places.
\v 15 O the happiness of the people that is thus, O the happiness of the people whose God is Yahweh!
\c 145
\v 1 Praise by David. I exalt Thee, my God, O king, And bless Your name to the age and for ever.
\v 2 Every day do I bless Thee, And praise Your name to the age and for ever.
\v 3 Great is Yahweh, and praised greatly, And of His greatness there is no searching.
\v 4 Generation to generation praiseth Your works, And Your mighty acts they declare.
\v 5 The honour — the glory of Your majesty, And the matters of Your wonders I declare.
\v 6 And the strength of Your fearful acts they tell, And Your greatness I recount.

\v 10 Confess Thee O Yahweh, do all Your works, And Your saints do bless Thee.
\v 11 The honour of Your kingdom they tell, And of Your might they speak,
\v 12 To make known to sons of men His mighty acts, The honour of the majesty of His kingdom.
\v 13 Your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, And Your dominion is in all generations.
\v 14 Yahweh is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.
\v 15 The eyes of all unto Thee do look, And You are giving to them their food in its season,
\v 16 Opening Your hand, and satisfying The desire of every living thing.
\v 17 Righteous is Yahweh in all His ways, And kind in all His works.
\v 18 Near is Yahweh to all those calling Him, To all who call Him in truth.
\v 19 The desire of those fearing Him He did, And their cry He heareth, and saveth them.
\v 20 Yahweh preserveth all those loving Him, And all the wicked He destroyeth.
\v 21 The praise of Yahweh my mouth spoke, And all flesh did bless His holy name, To the age and for ever!
\c 146
\v 1 Praise you Jah! Praise, O my soul, Yahweh.
\v 2 I praise Yahweh during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.
\v 3 Trust not in princes — in a son of man, For he had no deliverance.
\v 4 His spirit went forth, he returneth to his earth, In that day have his thoughts perished.
\v 5 O the happiness of him Who had the God of Jacob for his help, His hope is on Yahweh his God,
\v 6 Making the heavens and earth, The sea and all that is in them, Who is keeping truth to the age,
\v 7 Doing judgment for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry.
\v 8 Yahweh is loosing the prisoners, Yahweh is opening (the eyes of) the blind, Yahweh is raising the bowed down, Yahweh is loving the righteous,
\v 9 Yahweh is preserving the strangers, The fatherless and widow He caused to stand, And the way of the wicked He turneth upside down.
\v 10 Yahweh did reign to the age, Your God, O Zion, to generation and generation, Praise you Jah!
\c 147
\v 1 Praise you Jah! For it is good to praise our God, For pleasant — comely is praise.
\v 2 Building Jerusalem is Yahweh, The driven away of Israel He gathereth.
\v 3 Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, And is binding up their griefs.
\v 4 Appointing the number of the stars, To all them He gave names.
\v 5 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power, Of His understanding there is no narration.
\v 6 Yahweh is causing the meek to stand, Making low the wicked unto the earth.
\v 7 Answer you to Yahweh with thanksgiving, Sing you to our God with a harp.
\v 8 Who is covering the heavens with clouds, Who is preparing for the earth rain, Who is causing grass to spring up on mountains,
\v 9 Giving to the beast its food, To the young of the ravens that call.
\v 10 Not in the might of the horse did He delight, Not in the legs of a man is He pleased.
\v 11 Yahweh is pleased with those fearing Him, With those waiting for His kindness.
\v 12 Glorify, O Jerusalem, Yahweh, Praise your God, O Zion.
\v 13 For He did strengthen the bars of your gates, He had blessed your sons in your middle.
\v 14 Who is making your border peace, With the fat of wheat He satisfieth Thee.
\v 15 Who is sending forth His saying on earth, Very speedily did His word run.
\v 16 Who is giving snow like wool, Hoar-frost as ashes He scattereth.
\v 17 Casting forth His ice like morsels, Before His cold who did stand?
\v 18 He sent forth His word and melteth them, He caused His wind to blow — the waters flow.
\v 19 Declaring His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
\v 20 He had not done so to any nation, As to judgments, they have not known them. Praise you Jah!
\c 148
\v 1 Praise you Jah! Praise you Yahweh from the heavens, Praise you Him in high places.
\v 2 Praise you Him, all His messengers, Praise you Him, all His hosts.

\v 6 And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.
\v 7 Praise you Yahweh from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,
\v 8 Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;
\v 9 The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,
\v 10 The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,
\v 11 Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,
\v 12 Young men, and also maidens, Aged men, with youths,
\v 13 They praise the name of Yahweh, For His name alone had been set on high, His honour is above earth and heavens.
\v 14 And He exalteth the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints, Of the sons of Israel, a people near Him. Praise you Jah!
\c 149
\v 1 Praise you Jah! Sing you to Yahweh a new song, His praise in an assembly of saints.
\v 2 Israel did rejoice in his Maker, Sons of Zion do joy in their king.
\v 3 They praise His name in a dance, With timbrel and harp sing praise to Him.
\v 4 For Yahweh is pleased with His people, He beautifieth the humble with salvation.
\v 5 Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds.
\v 6 The exaltation of God is in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand.
\v 7 To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples.
\v 8 To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,
\v 9 To do among them the judgment written, An honour it is for all his saints. Praise you Jah!

\v 6 All that did breathe did praise Jah! Praise you Jah!
