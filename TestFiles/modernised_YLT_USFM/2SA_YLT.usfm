\v 1 And it came to pass, after the death of Saul, that David had returned from smiting the Amalekite, and David dwelleth in Ziklag two days,
\v 2 and it came to pass, on the third day, that behold, a man had come in out of the camp from Saul, and his garments are rent, and earth on his head; and it came to pass, in his coming in unto David, that he falleth to the earth, and did obeisance.
\v 3 And David said to him, 'Whence comest you?' and he said unto him, 'Out of the camp of Israel I have escaped.'
\v 4 And David said unto him, 'What had been the matter? declare, I pray you, to me.' And he said, that 'The people had fled from the battle, and also a multitude had fallen of the people, and they die; and also Saul and Jonathan his son have died.'
\v 5 And David said unto the youth who is declaring it to him, 'How hast you known that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?'
\v 6 And the youth who is declaring it to him said, I happened to meet in mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul is leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and those possessing horses have followed him;
\v 7 and he turneth behind him, and saw me, and called unto me, and I say, Here am I.
\v 8 And he said to me, Who are you? and I say unto him, An Amalekite I am.'
\v 9 And he said unto me, Stand, I pray you, over me, and put me to death, for seized me had the arrow, for all my soul is still in me.
\v 10 And I stand over him, and put him to death, for I knew that he did not live after his falling, and I take the crown which is on his head, and the bracelet which is on his arm, and bring them in unto my lord hither.'
\v 11 And David took hold on his garments, and rendeth them, and also all the men who are with him,
\v 12 and they mourn, and weep, and fast till the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel, because they have fallen by the sword.
\v 13 And David said unto the youth who is declaring it to him, 'Whence are you?' and he said, 'Son of a sojourner, an Amalekite, I am.'
\v 14 And David said unto him, 'How wast you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the anointed of Yahweh?'
\v 15 And David called to one of the youths, and said, 'Draw nigh — fall upon him;' and he smiteth him, and he dieth;
\v 16 and David said unto him, 'Your blood is on yours own head, for your mouth had testified against you, saying, I — I put to death the anointed of Yahweh.'
\v 17 And David lamenteth with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son;
\v 18 and he said to teach the sons of Judah 'The Bow;' behold, it is written on the book of the Upright: — 
\v 19 The Roebuck, O Israel, On your high places is wounded; How have the mighty fallen!
\v 20 Declare it not in Gath, Proclaim not the tidings in the streets of Ashkelon, Lest they rejoice — The daughters of the Philistines, Lest they exult — The daughters of the Uncircumcised!
\v 21 Mountains of Gilboa! No dew nor rain be on you, And fields of heave-offerings! For there had become loathsome The shield of the mighty, The shield of Saul — without the anointed with oil.
\v 22 From the blood of the wounded, From the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan Hath not turned backward; And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
\v 23 Saul and Jonathan! They are loved and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they have not been parted. Than eagles they have been lighter, Than lions they have been mightier!
\v 24 Daughters of Israel! for Saul weep you, Who is clothing you in scarlet with delights. Who is lifting up ornaments of gold on your clothing.
\v 25 How have the mighty fallen In the middle of the battle! Jonathan! on your high places wounded!
\v 26 I am in distress for you, my brother Jonathan, Very pleasant wast you to me; Wonderful was your love to me, Above the love of women!
\v 27 How have the mighty fallen, Yea, the weapons of war perish!'
\c 2
\v 1 And it came to pass afterwards, that David asketh at Yahweh, saying, 'Do I go up into one of the cities of Judah?' and Yahweh said unto him, 'Go up.' And David said, 'Whither do I go up?' and He said, 'To Hebron.'
\v 2 And David went up thither, and also his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
\v 3 and his men who are with him had David brought up — a man and his household — and they dwell in the cities of Hebron.
\v 4 And the men of Judah come, and anoint there David for king over the house of Judah; and they declare to David, saying, 'The men of Jabesh-Gilead are they who buried Saul.'
\v 5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said unto them, 'Blessed are you of Yahweh, in that you have done this kindness with your lord, with Saul, that you bury him.
\v 6 'And, now, Yahweh did with you kindness and truth, and also, I do with you this good because you have done this thing;
\v 7 and now, are your hands strong, and be you for sons of valour, for your lord Saul. is dead, and also — me have the house of Judah anointed for king over them.'
\v 8 And Abner, son of Ner, head of the host which Saul had, had taken Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, and caused him to pass over to Mahanaim,
\v 9 and caused him to reign over Gilead, and over the Ashurite, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over Israel — all of it.
\v 10 A son of forty years, is Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, in his reigning over Israel, and two years he had reigned, only the house of Judah have been after David.
\v 11 And the number of the days that David had been king in Hebron, over the house of Judah, is seven years and six months.
\v 12 And Abner son of Ner went out, and servants of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\v 13 And Joab son of Zeruiah, and servants of David, have gone out, and they meet by the pool of Gibeon together, and sit down, these by the pool on this side, and these by the pool on that.
\v 14 And Abner said unto Joab, 'Let the youths rise, I pray you, and they play before us;' and Joab said, 'Let them rise.'
\v 15 And they rise and pass over, in number twelve of Benjamin, even of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\v 16 And they lay hold, each on the head of his companion, and his sword is in the side of his companion, and they fall together, and one called that place Helkath-Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon,
\v 17 and the battle is very hard on that day, and Abner is smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
\v 18 And there are there three sons of Zeruiah, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel, and Asahel is light on his feet, as one of the roes which are in the field,
\v 19 And Asahel pursueth after Abner, and had not turned aside to go to the right or to the left, from after Abner.
\v 20 And Abner looketh behind him, and said, 'Art you he — Asahel?' and he said, 'I am.'
\v 21 And Abner said to him, 'Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize for you one of the youths, and take to you his armour;' and Asahel had not been willing to turn aside from after him.
\v 22 And Abner addeth again, saying unto Asahel, 'Turn you aside from after me, why do I smite you to the earth? and how do I lift up my face unto Joab your brother?'
\v 23 And he refuseth to turn aside, and Abner smiteth him with the hinder part of the spear unto the fifth rib, and the spear came out from behind him, and he falleth there, and dieth under it; and it came to pass, every one who had come unto the place where Asahel had fallen and dieth — they stand still.
\v 24 And Joab and Abishai pursue after Abner, and the sun had gone in, and they have come in unto the height of Ammah, which is on the front of Giah, the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\v 25 And the sons of Benjamin gather themselves together after Abner, and become one troop, and stand on the top of a certain height,
\v 26 and Abner called unto Joab, and said, 'For ever did the sword consume? hast you not known that it is bitterness in the latter end? and till when will you not say to the people to turn back from after their brethren?'
\v 27 And Joab said, 'God lived! for unless you hadst spoken, surely then from the morning had the people gone up each from after his brother.'
\v 28 And Joab bloweth with a trumpet, and all the people stand still, and pursue no more after Israel, nor have they added any more to fight.
\v 29 And Abner and his men have gone through the plain all that night, and pass over the Jordan, and go on through all Bithron, and come in to Mahanaim.
\v 30 And Joab had turned back from after Abner, and gathereth all the people, and there are lacking of the servants of David nineteen men, and Asahel;
\v 31 and the servants of David have smitten of Benjamin, even among the men of Abner, three hundred and sixty men — they died.
\v 32 And they lift up Asahel, and bury him in the burying-place of his father, which is in Beth-Lehem, and they go all the night — Joab and his men — and it is light to them in Hebron.
\c 3
\v 1 And the war is long between the house of Saul and the house of David, and David is going on and is strong, and the house of Saul are going on and are weak.
\v 2 And there are born to David sons in Hebron, and his first-born is Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
\v 3 and his second is Chileab, of Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite, and the third is Absalom son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur,
\v 4 and the fourth is Adonijah son of Haggith, and the fifth is Shephatiah son of Abital,
\v 5 and the sixth is Ithream, of Eglah wife of David; these have been born to David in Hebron.
\v 6 And it came to pass, in the war being between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner had been strengthening himself in the house of Saul,
\v 7 and Saul had a concubine, and her name is Rizpah daughter of Aiah, and Ish-Bosheth said unto Abner, 'Wherefore hast you gone in unto the concubine of my father?'
\v 8 And it is displeasing to Abner exceedingly, because of the words of Ish-Bosheth, and he said, 'The head of a dog am I — that in reference to Judah to-day I do kindness with the house of Saul your father, unto his brethren, and unto his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David — that you chargest against me iniquity concerning the woman to-day?
\v 9 thus did God to Abner, and thus He did add to him, surely as Yahweh had sworn to David — surely so I do to him:
\v 10 to cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel, and over Judah, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba.'
\v 11 And he is not able any more to turn back Abner a word, because of his fearing him.
\v 12 And Abner sent messengers unto David for himself, saying, 'Whose is the land?' saying, 'Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand is with you, to bring round unto you all Israel.'
\v 13 And he said, 'Good — I make with you a covenant; only, one thing I am asking of you, that is, You will not see my face, except you will first bring in Michal, daughter of Saul in your coming into see my face.'
\v 14 And David sent messengers unto Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, saying, 'Give up my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.'
\v 15 And Ish-Bosheth sent, and took her from a man, from Phaltiel son of Laish,
\v 16 and her husband went with her, going on and weeping behind her, unto Bahurim, and Abner said unto him, 'Go, turn back;' and he turneth back.
\v 17 And the word of Abner was with the elders of Israel, saying, 'Heretofore you have been seeking David for king over you,
\v 18 and now, do it, for Yahweh had spoken of David saying, By the hand of David my servant — to save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.'
\v 19 And Abner spoke also in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that is good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin,
\v 20 and Abner came in unto David, to Hebron, and with him twenty men, and David made for Abner, and for the men who are with him, a banquet.
\v 21 And Abner said unto David, 'I arise, and go, and gather unto my lord the king the whole of Israel, and they make with you a covenant, and you hast reigned over all that your soul desireth;' and David sent away Abner, and he went in peace.
\v 22 And behold, the servants of David, and Joab, have come from the troop, and much spoil have brought with them, and Abner is not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he went in peace;
\v 23 and Joab and all the host that is with him have come, and they declare to Joab, saying, 'Abner son of Ner had come unto the king, and he sent him away, and he went in peace.'
\v 24 And Joab came unto the king, and said, 'What hast you done? behold, Abner had come unto you! why is this — you hast sent him away, and he is really gone?
\v 25 You hast known Abner son of Ner, that to deceive you he came, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.'
\v 26 And Joab went out from David, and sent messengers after Abner, and they bring him back from the well of Sirah, and David knew not.
\v 27 And Abner turneth back to Hebron, and Joab turneth him aside unto the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smiteth him there in the fifth rib — and he dieth — for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\v 28 And David heareth afterwards and said, 'Acquitted am I, and my kingdom, by Yahweh, unto the age, from the blood of Abner son of Ner;
\v 29 it did stay on the head of Joab, and on all the house of his father, and there is not cut off from the house of Joab one having an issue, and leprous, and laying hold on a staff, and falling by a sword, and lacking bread.'
\v 30 And Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because that he put to death Asahel their brother, in Gibeon, in battle.
\v 31 And David said unto Joab, and unto all the people who are with him, 'Rend your garments, and gird on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner;' and king David is going after the bier.
\v 32 And they bury Abner in Hebron, and the king lifteth up his voice, and weepeth at the grave of Abner, and all the people weep;
\v 33 and the king lamenteth for Abner, and said: — 'As the death of a fool did Abner die?
\v 34 Your hands not bound, And your feet to fetters not brought nigh! As one falling before sons of evil — You hast fallen!' and all the people add to weep over him.
\v 35 And all the people come to cause David to eat bread while yet day, and David sweareth, saying, 'Thus did God to me, and thus He did add, for — before the going in of the sun, I taste no bread or any other thing.'
\v 36 And all the people have discerned it, and it is good in their eyes, as all that the king had done is good in the eyes of all the people;
\v 37 and all the people know, even all Israel, in that day, that it had not been from the king — to put to death Abner son of Ner.
\v 38 And the king said unto his servants, 'Do you not know that a prince and a great one had fallen this day in Israel?
\v 39 and I to-day am tender, and an anointed king: and these men, sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me; Yahweh did recompense to the doer of the evil according to his evil.'
\c 4
\v 1 And the son of Saul heareth that Abner is dead in Hebron, and his hands are feeble, and all Israel have been troubled.
\v 2 And two men, heads of troops, have been to the son of Saul, the name of the one is Baanah, and the name of the second Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for also Beeroth is reckoned to Benjamin,
\v 3 and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim, and are there sojourners unto this day.
\v 4 And to Jonathan son of Saul is a son — lame; he was a son of five years at the coming in of the rumour of the death of Saul and Jonathan, out of Jezreel, and his nurse lifteth him up, and fleeth, and it came to pass in her hasting to flee, that he falleth, and became lame, and his name is Mephibosheth.
\v 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, go, and come in at the heat of the day unto the house of Ish-Bosheth, and he is lying down — the lying down of noon;
\v 6 and thither they have come, unto the middle of the house, taking wheat, and they smite him unto the fifth rib, and Rechab and Baanah his brother have escaped;
\v 7 yea, they come in to the house, and he is lying on his bed, in the inner part of his bed-chamber, and they smite him, and put him to death, and turn aside his head, and they take his head, and go the way of the plain all the night,
\v 8 and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron, and say unto the king, 'Lo, the head of Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, yours enemy, who sought your life; and Yahweh did give to my lord the king vengeance this day, of Saul and of his seed.'
\v 9 And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, 'Yahweh lived, who had redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\v 10 when one is declaring to me, saying, Lo, Saul is dead, and he was as a bearer of tidings in his own eyes, then I take hold on him, and slay him in Ziklag, instead of my giving to him for the tidings.
\v 11 Also — when wicked men have killed the righteous man in his own house, on his bed; and now, do not I require his blood of your hand, and have taken you away from the earth?'
\v 12 And David commandeth the young men, and they slay them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hang them over the pool in Hebron, and the head of Ish-Bosheth they have taken, and bury it in the burying-place of Abner in Hebron.
\c 5
\v 1 And all the tribes of Israel come unto David, to Hebron, and speak, saying, 'Lo, we are your bone and your flesh;
\v 2 also heretofore, in Saul's being king over us, you hast been he who is bringing out and bringing in Israel, and Yahweh said to you, You will feed My people Israel, and you are for leader over Israel.'
\v 3 And all the elders of Israel come unto the king, to Hebron, and king David made with them a covenant in Hebron before Yahweh, and they anoint David for king over Israel.
\v 4 A son of thirty years is David in his being king; forty years he had reigned;
\v 5 in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years, over all Israel and Judah.
\v 6 And the king went, and his men, to Jerusalem, unto the Jebusite, the inhabitant of the land, and they speak to David, saying, 'You will not come in hither, except you turn aside the blind and the lame;' saying, 'David did not come in hither.'
\v 7 And David captureth the fortress of Zion, it is the city of David.
\v 8 And David said on that day, 'Any one smiting the Jebusite, (let him go up by the watercourse), and the lame and the blind — the hated of David's soul,' — because the blind and lame say, 'He did not come into the house.'
\v 9 And David dwelleth in the fortress, and called it — City of David, and David built round about, from Millo and inward,
\v 10 and David went, going on and becoming great, and Yahweh, God of Hosts, is with him.
\v 11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers unto David, and cedar-trees, and artificers of wood, and artificers of stone, for walls, and they build a house for David,
\v 12 and David knoweth that Yahweh had established him for king over Israel, and that He had lifted up his kingdom, because of His people Israel.
\v 13 And David took again concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after his coming from Hebron, and there are born again to David sons and daughters.
\v 14 And these are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\v 15 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\v 16 and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
\v 17 And the Philistines hear that they have anointed David for king over Israel, and all the Philistines come up to seek David, and David heareth, and went down unto the fortress,
\v 18 and the Philistines have come, and are spread out in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 19 And David asketh of Yahweh, saying, 'Do I go up unto the Philistines? will You give them into my hand?' And Yahweh said unto David, 'Go up, for I certainly give the Philistines into your hand.'
\v 20 And David came in to Baal-Perazim, and David smiteth them there, and said, 'Yahweh had broken forth on mine enemies before me, as the breaking forth of waters;' therefore he had called the name of that place Baal-Perazim.
\v 21 And they forsake there their idols, and David and his men lift them up.
\v 22 And the Philistines add again to come up, and are spread out in the valley of Rephaim,
\v 23 and David asketh of Yahweh, and He said, 'You will not go up, turn round unto their rear, and you hast come to them over-against the mulberries,
\v 24 and it came to pass, in your hearing the sound of a stepping in the tops of the mulberries, then you will move sharply, for then had Yahweh gone out before you to smite in the camp of the Philistines.'
\v 25 And David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and smiteth the Philistines from Geba unto your coming to Gazer.
\c 6
\v 1 And David gathered again every chosen one in Israel, thirty thousand,
\v 2 and David riseth and went, and all the people who are with him, from Baale-Judah, to bring up there the ark of God, whose name had been called — the name of Yahweh of Hosts, inhabiting the cherubs — upon it.
\v 3 And they cause the ark of God to ride on a new cart, and lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which is in the height, and Uzzah and Ahio sons of Abinadab are leading the new cart;
\v 4 and they lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which is in the height, with the ark of God, and Ahio is going before the ark,
\v 5 and David and all the house of Israel are playing before Yahweh, with all kinds of instruments of fir-wood, even with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cornets, and with cymbals.
\v 6 And they come unto the threshing-floor of Nachon, and Uzzah putteth forth his hand unto the ark of God, and laid hold on it, for they released the oxen;
\v 7 and the anger of Yahweh burneth against Uzzah, and God smiteth him there for the error, and he dieth there by the ark of God.
\v 8 And it is displeasing to David, because that Yahweh had broken forth a breach upon Uzzah, and one called that place Perez-Uzzah, unto this day;
\v 9 and David feareth Yahweh on that day, and said, 'How did the ark of Yahweh come in unto me?'
\v 10 And David had not been willing to turn aside unto himself the ark of Yahweh, to the city of David, and David turneth it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite,
\v 11 and the ark of Yahweh did inhabit the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months, and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and all his house.
\v 12 And it is declared to king David, saying, 'Yahweh had blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had, because of the ark of God;' and David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with joy.
\v 13 And it came to pass, when those bearing the ark of Yahweh have stepped six steps, that he sacrificeth an ox and a fatling.
\v 14 And David is dancing with all strength before Yahweh, and David is girded with a linen ephod,
\v 15 and David and all the house of Israel are bringing up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the voice of a trumpet,
\v 16 and it had come to pass, the ark of Yahweh had come in to the city of David, and Michal daughter of Saul, had looked through the window, and saw king David moving and dancing before Yahweh, and despiseth him in her heart.
\v 17 And they bring in the ark of Yahweh, and set it up in its place, in the middle of the tent which David had spread out for it, and David caused to ascend burnt-offerings before Yahweh, and peace-offerings.
\v 18 And David finisheth from causing to ascend the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Hosts,
\v 19 and he apportioneth to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from man even unto woman, to each, one cake of bread, and one eshpar, and one ashisha, and all the people go, each to his house.
\v 20 And David turneth back to bless his house, and Michal daughter of Saul went out to meet David, and said, 'How honourable to-day was the king of Israel, who was uncovered to-day before the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain ones is openly uncovered!'
\v 21 And David said unto Michal, ' — Before Yahweh, who fixed on me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me leader over the people of Yahweh, and over Israel, — yea, I played before Yahweh;
\v 22 and I have been more vile than this, and have been low in mine eyes, and with the handmaids whom you hast spoken of, with them I am honoured.'
\v 23 As to Michal daughter of Saul, she had no child till the day of her death.
\c 7
\v 1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and Yahweh had given rest to him round about, from all his enemies,
\v 2 that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, 'See, I pray you, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God is dwelling in the middle of the curtain.'
\v 3 And Nathan said unto the king, 'All that is in yours heart — go, do, for Yahweh is with you.'
\v 4 And it came to pass in that night, that the word of Yahweh is unto Nathan, saying,
\v 5 'Go, and you hast said unto My servant, unto David, Thus said Yahweh, Dost you build for Me a house for My dwelling in?
\v 6 for I have not dwelt in a house even from the day of My bringing up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even unto this day, and am walking up and down in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\v 7 During all the time that I have walked up and down among all the sons of Israel, a word have I spoken with one of the tribes of Israel which I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built to Me a house of cedars?
\v 8 and now, thus will you say to My servant, to David: 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, I have taken you from the comely place, from after the flock, to be leader over My people, over Israel;
\v 9 and I am with you wheresoever you hast gone, and I cut off all yours enemies from your presence, and have made for you a great name, as the name of the great ones who are in the earth,
\v 10 and I have appointed a place for My people, for Israel, and have planted it, and it had tabernacled in its place, and it is not troubled any more, and the sons of perverseness do not add to afflict it any more, as in the beginning,
\v 11 even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I have given rest to you from all yours enemies, and Yahweh had declared to you that Yahweh did make for you a house.
\v 12 'When your days are full, and you hast lain with your fathers, then I have raised up your seed after you which went out from your bowels, and have established his kingdom;
\v 13 He did build a house for My Name, and I have established the throne of his kingdom unto the age.
\v 14 I am to him for a father, and he is to Me for a son; whom in his dealings perversely I have even reproved with a rod of men, and with strokes of the sons of Adam,
\v 15 and My kindness did not turn aside from him, as I turned it aside from Saul, whom I turned aside from before you,
\v 16 and stedfast is your house and your kingdom unto the age before you, your throne is established unto the age.'
\v 17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan unto David.
\v 18 And king David came in and sitteth before Yahweh, and said, 'Who am I, Lord Yahweh? and what my house, that You hast brought me hitherto?
\v 19 And yet this is little in Thine eyes, Lord Yahweh, and You will speak also concerning the house of Your servant afar off; and this is the law of the Man, Lord Yahweh.
\v 20 And what did David add more to speak unto Thee? and You, You hast known Your servant, Lord Yahweh.
\v 21 Because of Your word, and according to Your heart, You hast done all this greatness, to cause Your servant to know it.
\v 22 Therefore You hast been great, Yahweh God, for there is none like Thee, and there is no God save Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\v 23 And who is as Your people, as Israel — one nation in the earth, whom God had gone to redeem to Him for a people, and to make for Him a name — and to do for you the greatness — even fearful things for Your land, at the presence of Your people, whom You hast redeemed to Thee out of Egypt — among the nations and their gods?
\v 24 Yea, You will establish to Thee Your people Israel, to Thee for a people unto the age, and You, Yahweh, hast been to them for God.
\v 25 'And now, Yahweh God, the word which You hast spoken concerning Your servant, and concerning his house, establish unto the age, and do as You hast spoken;
\v 26 And Your Name is great unto the age, saying, Yahweh of Hosts is God over Israel, and the house of Your servant David is established before Thee,
\v 27 For You, Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, You hast uncovered the ear of Your servant, saying, A house I build for you, therefore had Your servant found his heart to pray unto Thee this prayer;
\v 28 And now, Lord Yahweh, You are God Himself, and Your words are truth, and You speakest unto Your servant this goodness,
\v 29 And now, begin and bless the house of Your servant, to be unto the age before Thee, for You, Lord Yahweh, hast spoken, and by Your blessing is the house of Your servant blessed — to the age.'

\v 1 And it came to pass afterwards that David smiteth the Philistines, and humbleth them, and David took the bridle of the metropolis out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 2 And he smiteth Moab, and measureth them with a line, causing them to lie down on the earth, and he measureth two lines to put to death, and the fulness of the line to keep alive, and the Moabites are to David for servants, bearers of a present.
\v 3 And David smiteth Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, in his going to bring back his power by the River Euphrates;
\v 4 and David captureth from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David destroyeth utterly the whole of the charioteers, only he leaveth of them a hundred charioteers.
\v 5 And Aram of Damascus came to give help to Hadadezer king of Zobah, and David smiteth of Aram twenty and two thousand men;
\v 6 and David putteth garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and Aram is to David for a servant, bearing a present; and Yahweh saveth David wheresoever he had gone;
\v 7 and David took the shields of gold which were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem;
\v 8 and from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, had king David taken very much brass.
\v 9 And Toi king of Hamath heareth that David had smitten all the force of Hadadezer,
\v 10 and Toi sent Joram his son unto king David to ask of him of welfare, and to bless him, (because that he had fought against Hadadezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars with Toi had Hadadezer been), and in his hand have been vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass,
\v 11 also them did king David sanctify to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold which he sanctified of all the nations which he subdued:
\v 12 of Aram, and of Moab, and of the Bene-Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah.
\v 13 And David made a name in his turning back from his smiting Aram in the valley of Salt — eighteen thousand;
\v 14 and he putteth in Edom garrisons — in all Edom he had put garrisons, and all Edom are servants to David; and Yahweh saveth David wheresoever he had gone.
\v 15 And David reigneth over all Israel, and David is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people,
\v 16 and Joab son of Zeruiah is over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud is remembrancer,
\v 17 and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech son of Abiathar, are priests, and Seraiah is scribe,
\v 18 and Benaiah son of Jehoiada is over both the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the sons of David have been ministers.
\c 9
\v 1 And David said, 'Is there yet any left to the house of Saul, and I do with him kindness because of Jonathan?'
\v 2 And the house of Saul had a servant, and his name is Ziba, and they call for him unto David; and the king said unto him, 'Art you Ziba?' and he said, 'Your servant.'
\v 3 And the king said, 'Is there not yet a man to the house of Saul, and I do with him the kindness of God?' And Ziba said unto the king, 'Jonathan had yet a son — lame.'
\v 4 And the king said to him, 'Where is he?' and Ziba said unto the king, 'Lo, he is in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lo-Debar.'
\v 5 And king David sent, and took him out of the house of Machir son of Ammiel, of Lo-Debar,
\v 6 and Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came unto David, and falleth on his face, and did obeisance, and David said, 'Mephibosheth;' and he said, 'Lo, your servant.'
\v 7 And David said to him, 'Be not afraid; for I certainly do with you kindness because of Jonathan your father, and have given back to you all the field of Saul your father, and you will eat bread at my table continually.'
\v 8 And he boweth himself, and said, 'What is your servant, that you hast turned unto the dead dog — such as I?'
\v 9 And the king called unto Ziba servant of Saul, and said unto him, 'All that was to Saul and to all his house, I have given to the son of your lord,
\v 10 and you hast served for him the land, you and your sons, and your servants, and hast brought in, and there had been to the son of your lord bread, and he had eaten it; and Mephibosheth son of your lord did eat continually bread at my table;' and Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\v 11 And Ziba said unto the king, 'According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so did your servant;' as to Mephibosheth, 'he is eating at my table (said the king) as one of the sons of the king.'
\v 12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, and his name is Micha, and every one dwelling in the house of Ziba are servants to Mephibosheth.
\v 13 And Mephibosheth is dwelling in Jerusalem, for at the table of the king he is eating continually, and he is lame of his two feet.
\c 10
\v 1 And it came to pass afterwards, that the king of the Bene-Ammon dieth, and Hanun his son reigneth in his stead,
\v 2 and David said, 'I do kindness with Hanun son of Nahash, as his father did with me kindness;' and David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants concerning his father, and the servants of David come in to the land of the Bene-Ammon.
\v 3 And the heads of the Bene-Ammon say unto Hanun their lord, 'Is David honouring your father in yours eyes because he had sent to you comforters? for to search the city, and to spy it, and to overthrow it, had not David sent his servants unto you?'
\v 4 And Hanun took the servants of David, and shaveth off the half of their beard, and cutteth off their long robes in the middle — unto their buttocks, and sent them away;
\v 5 and they declare it to David, and he sent to meet them, for the men have been greatly ashamed, and the king said, 'Abide in Jericho till your beard did spring up — then you have returned.'
\v 6 And the Bene-Ammon see that they have been abhorred by David, and the Bene-Ammon send and hire Aram of Beth-Rehob, and Aram of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and Ish-Tob with twelve thousand men;
\v 7 and David heareth, and sent Joab, and all the host — the mighty men.
\v 8 And the Bene-Ammon come out, and set battle in array, at the opening of the gate, and Aram of Zoba, and Rehob, and Ish-Tob, and Maacah, are by themselves in the field;
\v 9 and Joab saw that the front of the battle had been unto him before and behind, and he chooseth of all the chosen in Israel, and setteth in array to meet Aram,
\v 10 and the rest of the people he had given into the hand of Abishai his brother, and setteth in array to meet the Bene-Ammon.
\v 11 And he said, 'If Aram be stronger than I, then you hast been to me for salvation, and if the Bene-Ammon be stronger than you, then I have come to give salvation to you;
\v 12 be strong and strengthen thyself for our people, and for the cities of our God, and Yahweh did that which is good in His eyes.'
\v 13 And Joab draweth nigh, and the people who are with him, to battle against Aram, and they flee from his presence;
\v 14 and the Bene-Ammon have seen that Aram had fled, and they flee from the presence of Abishai, and go in to the city; and Joab turneth back from the Bene-Ammon, and came in to Jerusalem.
\v 15 And Aram saw that it is smitten before Israel, and they are gathered together;
\v 16 and Hadadezer sent, and brought out Aram which is beyond the River, and they come in to Helam, and Shobach head of the host of Hadadezer is before them.
\v 17 And it is declared to David, and he gathereth all Israel, and passeth over the Jordan, and came in to Helam, and Aram setteth itself in array to meet David, and they fight with him;
\v 18 and Aram fleeth from the presence of Israel, and David slaid of Aram seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen, and Shobach head of its host he had smitten, and he dieth there.
\v 19 And all the kings — servants of Hadadezer — see that they have been smitten before Israel, and make peace with Israel, and serve them; and Aram is afraid to help any more the Bene-Ammon.
\c 11
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the revolution of the year — at the time of the going out of the messengers — that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel, and they destroy the Bene-Ammon, and lay siege against Rabbah. And David is dwelling in Jerusalem,
\v 2 and it came to pass, at evening-time, that David riseth from off his couch, and walks up and down on the roof of the king's house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing, and the woman is of very good appearance,
\v 3 and David sent and inquireth about the woman, and said, 'Is not this Bath-Sheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite?'
\v 4 And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came unto him, and he lieth with her — and she is purifying herself from her uncleanness — and she turneth back unto her house;
\v 5 and the woman conceiveth, and sent, and declareth to David, and said, 'I am conceiving.'
\v 6 And David sent unto Joab, 'Send unto me Uriah the Hittite,' and Joab sent Uriah unto David;
\v 7 and Uriah came unto him, and David asketh of the prosperity of Joab, and of the prosperity of the people, and of the prosperity of the war.
\v 8 And David said to Uriah, 'Go down to your house, and wash your feet;' and Uriah went out of the king's house, and there went out after him a gift from the king,
\v 9 and Uriah lieth down at the opening of the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and had not gone down unto his house.
\v 10 And they declare to David, saying, 'Uriah had not gone down unto his house;' and David said unto Uriah, 'Hast you not come from a journey? wherefore hast you not gone down unto your house?'
\v 11 And Uriah said unto David, 'The ark, and Israel, and Judah, are abiding in booths, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, on the face of the field are encamping; and I — I go in unto my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife! — your life, and the life of your soul — if I do this thing.'
\v 12 And David said unto Uriah, 'Abide in this place also to-day, and to-morrow I send you away;' and Uriah abideth in Jerusalem, on that day, and on the morrow,
\v 13 and David called for him, and he eateth before him, and drinketh, and he caused him to drink, and he went out in the evening to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, and unto his house he had not gone down.
\v 14 And it came to pass in the morning, that David writeth a letter unto Joab, and sent by the hand of Uriah;
\v 15 and he writeth in the letter, saying, 'Place you Uriah over-against the front of the severest battle, and you have turned back from after him, and he had been smitten, and had died.'
\v 16 And it came to pass in Joab's watching of the city, that he appointeth Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men are;
\v 17 and the men of the city go out and fight with Joab, and there fall some of the people, of the servants of David; and there dieth also Uriah the Hittite.
\v 18 And Joab sent and declareth to David all the matters of the war,
\v 19 and commandeth the messenger, saying, 'At your finishing all the matters of the war to speak unto the king,
\v 20 then, it had been, if the king's fury ascend, and he had said to you, Wherefore did you draw nigh unto the city to fight? did you not know that they shoot from off the wall?
\v 21 Who smote Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast on him a piece of a rider from the wall, and he dieth in Thebez? why drew you nigh unto the wall? that you hast said, Also your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'
\v 22 And the messenger went, and came in, and declareth to David all that with which Joab sent him,
\v 23 and the messenger said unto David, 'Surely the men have been mighty against us, and come out unto us into the field, and we are upon them unto the opening of the gate,
\v 24 and those shooting shoot at your servants from off the wall, and some of the servants of the king are dead, and also, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.
\v 25 And David said unto the messenger, 'Thus will you say unto Joab, Let not this thing be evil in yours eyes; for thus and thus did the sword devour; strengthen your warfare against the city, and throw it down — and strengthen you him.'
\v 26 And the wife of Uriah heareth that Uriah her husband is dead, and lamenteth for her lord;
\v 27 and the mourning passeth by, and David sent and gathereth her unto his house, and she is to him for a wife, and beareth to him a son; and the thing which David had done is evil in the eyes of Yahweh.
\c 12
\v 1 And Yahweh sent Nathan unto David, and he came unto him, and said to him: 'Two men have been in one city; One rich and one poor;
\v 2 The rich had flocks and herds very many;
\v 3 And the poor one had nothing, Except one little ewe-lamb, Which he had bought, and keepeth alive, And it groweth up with him, And with his sons together; Of his morsel it eateth, And from his cup it drinketh, And in his bosom it lieth, And it is to him as a daughter;
\v 4 And there came a traveller to the rich man, And he spareth to take Of his own flock, and of his own herd, To prepare for the traveller Who had come to him, And he took the ewe-lamb of the poor man, And prepared it for the man Who had come unto him.'
\v 5 And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly, and he said unto Nathan, 'Yahweh lived, surely a son of death is the man who is doing this,
\v 6 and the ewe-lamb he did repay fourfold, because that he had done this thing, and because that he had no pity.'
\v 7 And Nathan said unto David, 'You are the man! Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, I anointed you for king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;
\v 8 and I give to you the house of your lord, and the wives of your lord, into your bosom, and I give to you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if little, then I add to you such and such things.
\v 9 'Wherefore hast you despised the word of Yahweh, to do the evil thing in His eyes? Uriah the Hittite you hast smitten by the sword, and his wife you hast taken to you for a wife, and him you hast killed by the sword of the Bene-Ammon.
\v 10 'And now, the sword did not turn aside from your house unto the age, because you hast despised Me, and will take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to you for a wife;
\v 11 thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am raising up against you evil, out of your house, and have taken your wives before yours eyes, and given to your neighbour, and he had lain with your wives before the eyes of this sun;
\v 12 for you hast done it in secret, and I do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'
\v 13 And David said unto Nathan, 'I have sinned against Yahweh.' And Nathan said unto David, 'Also — Yahweh had caused your sin to pass away; you will not die;
\v 14 only, because you hast caused the enemies of Yahweh greatly to despise by this thing, also the son who is born to you did surely die.'
\v 15 And Nathan went unto his house, and Yahweh smiteth the lad, whom the wife of Uriah had born to David, and it is incurable;
\v 16 and David seeketh God for the youth, and David keepeth a fast, and had gone in and lodged, and lain on the earth.
\v 17 And the elders of his house rise against him, to raise him up from the earth, and he had not been willing, nor had he eaten with them bread;
\v 18 and it came to pass on the seventh day, that the lad dieth, and the servants of David fear to declare to him that the lad is dead, for they said, 'Lo, in the lad being alive we spake unto him, and he did not hearken to our voice; and how do we say unto him, The lad is dead? — then he had done evil.'
\v 19 And David saw that his servants are whispering, and David understandeth that the lad is dead, and David said unto his servants, 'Is the lad dead?' and they say, 'Dead.'
\v 20 And David riseth from the earth, and did bathe and anoint himself, and changeth his raiment, and came in to the house of Yahweh, and boweth himself, and came unto his house, and asketh and they place for him bread, and he eateth.
\v 21 And his servants say unto him, 'What is this thing you hast done? because of the living lad you hast fasted and will weep, and when the lad is dead you hast risen and will eat bread.'
\v 22 And he said, 'While the lad is alive I have fasted, and weep, for I said, Who knoweth? — Yahweh did pity me, and the lad had lived;
\v 23 and now, he had died, why is this — I fast? am I able to bring him back again? I am going unto him, and he did not turn back unto me.'
\v 24 And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lieth with her, and she beareth a son, and he called his name Solomon; and Yahweh had loved him,
\v 25 and sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jedidiah, because of Yahweh.
\v 26 And Joab fighteth against Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and captureth the royal city,
\v 27 and Joab sent messengers unto David, and said, 'I have fought against Rabbah — also I have captured the city of waters;
\v 28 and now, gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and capture it, lest I capture the city, and my name had been called upon it.'
\v 29 And David gathereth all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fighteth against it, and captureth it;
\v 30 and he took the crown of their king from off his head, and its weight is a talent of gold, and precious stones, and it is on the head of David; and the spoil of the city he had brought out, very much;
\v 31 and the people who are in it he had brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes of iron, and had caused them to pass over into the brick-kiln; and so he did to all the cities of the Bene-Ammon; and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.
\c 13
\v 1 And it came to pass afterwards that Absalom son of David had a fair sister, and her name is Tamar, and Amnon son of David loveth her.
\v 2 And Amnon had distress — even to become sick, because of Tamar his sister, for she is a virgin, and it is hard in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.
\v 3 And Amnon had a friend, and his name is Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David's brother, and Jonadab is a very wise man,
\v 4 and said to him, 'Wherefore are you thus lean, O king's son, morning by morning? will you not declare to me?' And Amnon said to him, 'Tamar — sister of Absalom my brother — I am loving.'
\v 5 And Jonadab said to him, 'Lie down on your couch, and feign thyself sick, and your father had come in to see you, and you hast said unto him, 'Let, I pray you, Tamar my sister come in and give me bread to eat; and she had made the food before mine eyes so that I see it, and have eaten from her hand.'
\v 6 And Amnon lieth down, and feigneth himself sick, and the king came in to see him, and Amnon said unto the king, 'Let, I pray you, Tamar my sister come, and she made before mine eyes two cakes, and I eat from her hand.'
\v 7 And David sent unto Tamar, to the house, saying, 'Go, I pray you, to the house of Amnon your brother, and make for him food.'
\v 8 And Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, and he is lying down, and she took the dough, and kneadeth, and made cakes before his eyes, and cooketh the cakes,
\v 9 and took the frying-pan, and poureth out before him, and he refuseth to eat, and Amnon said, 'Take you out every one from me;' and they go out every one from him.
\v 10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, 'Bring the food into the inner chamber, and I eat from your hand;' and Tamar took the cakes that she had made, and brought in to Amnon her brother, into the inner chamber,
\v 11 and she brought nigh unto him to eat, and he laid hold on her, and said to her, 'Come, lie with me, my sister.'
\v 12 And she said to him, 'Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it is not done so in Israel; do not this folly.
\v 13 And I — where do I cause my reproach to go? and you — you are as one of the fools in Israel; and now, speak, I pray you, unto the king; for he did not withhold me from you.'
\v 14 And he had not been willing to hearken to her voice, and is stronger than she, and humbleth her, and lieth with her.
\v 15 And Amnon hateth her — a very great hatred — that greater is the hatred with which he had hated her than the love with which he loved her, and Amnon said to her, 'Rise, go.'
\v 16 And she said to him, 'Because of the circumstances this evil is greater than the other that you hast done with me — to send me away;' and he had not been willing to hearken to her,
\v 17 and called his young man, his servant, and said, 'Send away, I pray you, this one from me without, and bolt the door after her;'
\v 18  — and upon her is a long coat, for such upper robes do daughters of the king who are virgins put on, — and his servant took her out without, and had bolted the door after her.
\v 19 And Tamar took ashes for her head, and the long coat that is on her she had rent, and putteth her hand on her head, and went, going on and crying;
\v 20 and Absalom her brother said unto her, 'Hath Amnon your brother been with you? and now, my sister, keep silent, he is your brother; set not your heart to this thing;' and Tamar dwelleth — but desolate — in the house of Absalom her brother.
\v 21 And king David had heard all these things, and it is very displeasing to him;
\v 22 and Absalom had not spoken with Amnon either evil or good, for Absalom is hating Amnon, because that he humbled Tamar his sister.
\v 23 And it came to pass, after two years of days, that Absalom had shearers in Baal-Hazor, which is with Ephraim, and Absalom called for all the sons of the king.
\v 24 And Absalom came unto the king, and said, 'Lo, I pray you, your servant had shearers, let the king go, I pray you, and his servants, with your servant.'
\v 25 And the king said unto Absalom, 'Nay, my son, let us not all go, I pray you, and we are not too heavy on you;' and he presseth on him, and he had not been willing to go, and he blessed him.
\v 26 And Absalom said, 'If not — let, I pray you, Amnon my brother go with us;' and the king said to him, 'Why did he go with you?'
\v 27 and Absalom urgeth on him, and he sent with him Amnon, and all the sons of the king.
\v 28 And Absalom commandeth his young men, saying, 'See, I pray you, when the heart of Amnon is glad with wine, and I have said unto you, Smite Amnon, that you have put him to death; fear not; is it not because I have commanded you? be strong, yea, become sons of valour.'
\v 29 And the young men of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom commanded, and rise do all the sons of the king, and they ride, each on his mule, and flee.
\v 30 And it came to pass — they are in the way — and the report had come unto David, saying, 'Absalom had smitten all the sons of the king, and there is not left of them one;'
\v 31 and the king riseth, and rendeth his garments, and lieth on the earth, and all his servants are standing by with rent garments.
\v 32 And Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, answereth and said, 'Let not my lord say, The whole of the young men, the sons of the king, they have put to death; for Amnon alone is dead, for by the command of Absalom it had been appointed from the day of his humbling Tamar his sister;
\v 33 and now, let not my lord the king lay unto his heart the word, saying, All the sons of the king have died, for Amnon alone is dead.'
\v 34 And Absalom fleeth, and the young man who is watching lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and behold, much people are coming by the way behind him, on the side of the hill.
\v 35 And Jonadab said unto the king, 'Lo, the sons of the king have come; as the word of your servant, so it had been.'
\v 36 And it came to pass at his finishing to speak, that behold, the sons of the king have come, and they lift up their voice, and weep, and also the king and all his servants have wept — a very great weeping.
\v 37 And Absalom had fled, and went unto Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur, and David mourneth for his son all the days.
\v 38 And Absalom had fled, and went to Geshur, and is there three years;
\v 39 and the soul of king David determineth to go out unto Absalom, for he had been comforted for Amnon, for he is dead.
\c 14
\v 1 And Joab son of Zeruial knoweth that the heart of the king is on Absalom,
\v 2 and Joab sent to Tekoah, and took there a wise woman, and said unto her, 'Feign thyself a mourner, I pray you, and put on, I pray you, garments of mourning, and anoint not thyself with oil, and you hast been as a woman these many days mourning for the dead,
\v 3 and you hast gone unto the king, and spoken unto him, according to this word;' and Joab putteth the words into her mouth.
\v 4 And the woman of Tekoah spoke unto the king, and falleth on her face to the earth, and did obeisance, and said, 'Save, O king.'
\v 5 And the king said to her, 'What — to you?' and she said, 'Truly a widow woman am I, and my husband dieth,
\v 6 and your maid-servant had two sons; and they strive both of them in a field, and there is no deliverer between them, and the one smiteth the other, and putteth him to death;
\v 7 and behold, the whole family had risen against your maid-servant, and say, Give up him who smiteth his brother, and we put him to death for the life of his brother whom he had killed, and we destroy also the heir; and they have quenched my coal which is left — so as not to set to my husband a name and remnant on the face of the ground.'
\v 8 And the king said unto the woman, 'Go to yours house, and I give charge concerning you.'
\v 9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, 'On me, my lord, O king, is the iniquity, and on the house of my father; and the king and his throne are innocent.'
\v 10 And the king said, 'He who spoke aught unto you, and you hast brought him unto me, then he did not add any more to come against you.'
\v 11 And she said, 'Let, I pray you, the king remember by Yahweh your God, that the redeemer of blood add not to destroy, and they destroy not my son;' and he said, 'Yahweh lived; if there did fall of the hair of your son to the earth.'
\v 12 And the woman said, 'Let, I pray you, your maid-servant speak unto my lord the king a word;' and he said, 'Speak.'
\v 13 And the woman said, 'And why hast you thought thus concerning the people of God? yea, the king is speaking this thing as a guilty one, in that the king had not brought back his outcast;
\v 14 for we do surely die, and are as water which is running down to the earth, which is not gathered, and God did not accept a person, and had devised devices in that the outcast is not outcast by Him.
\v 15 And now that I have come to speak unto the king my lord this word, it is because the people made me afraid, and your maid-servant said, Let me speak, I pray you, unto the king; it may be the king did do the word of his handmaid,
\v 16 for the king did hearken to deliver his handmaid out of the paw of the man seeking to destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God,
\v 17 and your maid-servant said, Let, I pray you, the word of my lord the king be for ease; for as a messenger of God so is my lord the king, to understand the good and the evil; and Yahweh your God is with you.'
\v 18 And the king answereth and said unto the woman, 'Do not, I pray you, hide from me the thing that I am asking you;' and the woman said, 'Let, I pray you, my lord the king speak.'
\v 19 And the king said, 'Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?' And the woman answereth and said, 'Your soul lived, my lord, O king, none did turn to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king had spoken; for your servant Joab he commanded me, and he put in the mouth of your maid-servant all these words;
\v 20 in order to bring round the appearance of the thing had your servant Joab done this thing, and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of a messenger of God, to know all that is in the land.'
\v 21 And the king said unto Joab, 'Lo, I pray you, you hast done this thing; and go, bring back the young man Absalom.'
\v 22 And Joab falleth on his face to the earth, and did obeisance, and blessed the king, and Joab said, 'To-day had your servant known that I have found grace in yours eyes, my lord, O king, in that the king had done the word of his servant.'
\v 23 And Joab riseth and went to Geshur, and brought in Absalom to Jerusalem,
\v 24 and the king said, 'Let him turn round unto his house, and my face he did not see.' And Absalom turneth round unto his house, and the face of the king he had not seen.
\v 25 And like Absalom there was no man so fair in all Israel, to praise greatly; from the sole of his foot even unto his crown there was no blemish in him;
\v 26 and in his polling his head — and it had been at the end of year by year that he polleth it, for it is heavy on him, and he had polled it — he had even weighed out the hair of his head — two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
\v 27 And there are born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter, and her name is Tamar; she was a woman of a fair appearance.
\v 28 And Absalom dwelleth in Jerusalem two years of days, and the face of the king he had not seen;
\v 29 and Absalom sent unto Joab, to send him unto the king, and he had not been willing to come unto him; and he sent again a second time, and he had not been willing to come.
\v 30 And he said unto his servants, 'See, the portion of Joab is by the side of mine, and he had barley there; go, and burn it with fire;' and the servants of Absalom burn the portion with fire.
\v 31 And Joab riseth and came unto Absalom in the house, and said unto him, 'Why have your servants burned the portion that I have with fire?'
\v 32 And Absalom said unto Joab, 'Lo, I sent unto you, saying, Come hither, and I send you unto the king to say, Why have I come in from Geshur? — good for me while I am there — and now, let me see the king's face, and if there is in me iniquity then you hast put me to death.'
\v 33 And Joab came unto the king, and declareth it to him, and he called unto Absalom, and he came unto the king, and boweth himself to him, on his face, to the earth, before the king, and the king gave a kiss to Absalom.
\c 15
\v 1 And it came to pass afterwards, that Absalom prepared for himself a chariot, and horses, and fifty men are running before him;
\v 2 and Absalom had risen early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate, and it came to pass, every man who had a pleading to come unto the king for judgment, that Absalom called unto him, and said, 'Of what city are you?' and he said, 'Of one of the tribes of Israel is your servant.'
\v 3 And Absalom said unto him, 'See, your matters are good and straightforward — and there is none hearkening to you from the king.'
\v 4 And Absalom said, 'Who did make me a judge in the land, that unto me did come every man who had a plea and judgment? — then I have declared him righteous.'
\v 5 And it had come to pass, in the drawing nearing of any one to bow himself to him, that he had put forth his hand, and laid hold on him, and given a kiss to him;
\v 6 and Absalom did according to this thing to all Israel who come in for judgment unto the king, and Absalom stealeth the heart of the men of Israel.
\v 7 And it came to pass, at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, 'Let me go, I pray you, and I complete my vow, that I vowed to Yahweh in Hebron,
\v 8 for a vow had your servant vowed in my dwelling in Geshur, in Aram, saying, If Yahweh did certainly bring me back to Jerusalem, then I have served Yahweh.'
\v 9 And the king said to him, 'Go in peace;' and he riseth and went to Hebron,
\v 10 and Absalom sent spies through all the tribes of Israel, saying, 'At your hearing the voice of the trumpet, then you have said, Absalom had reigned in Hebron.'
\v 11 And with Absalom have gone two hundred men, out of Jerusalem, invited ones, and they are going in their simplicity, and have not known anything;
\v 12 and Absalom sent Ahithophel the Gilonite, a counsellor of David, out of his city, out of Gilo, in his sacrificing sacrifices; and the conspiracy is strong, and the people are going and increasing with Absalom.
\v 13 And he who is declaring tidings came in unto David, saying, 'The heart of the men of Israel had been after Absalom.'
\v 14 And David said to all his servants who are with him in Jerusalem, 'Rise, and we flee, for we have no escape from the face of Absalom; haste to go, lest he hasten, and have overtaken us, and forced on us evil, and smitten the city by the mouth of the sword.'
\v 15 And the servants of the king say unto the king, 'According to all that my lord the king chooseth — behold, your servants do.'
\v 16 And the king went out, and all his household at his feet, and the king leaveth ten women — concubines — to keep the house.
\v 17 And the king went out, and all the people at his feet, and they stand still at the farthest off house.
\v 18 And all his servants are passing on at his side, and all the Cherethite, and all the Pelethite, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came at his feet from Gath, are passing on at the front of the king.
\v 19 And the king said unto Ittai the Gittite, 'Why will you go — you also — with us? turn back — and abide with the king, for you are a stranger, and also an exile you — to your place.
\v 20 Yesterday is your coming in, and to-day I move you to go with us, and I am going on that which I am going! — turn back, and take back your brethren with you, — kindness and truth.'
\v 21 And Ittai answereth the king and said, 'Yahweh lived, and my lord the king lived, surely in the place where my lord the king is — if for death, if for life, surely there is your servant.'
\v 22 And David said unto Ittai, 'Go and pass over;' and Ittai the Gittite passeth over, and all his men, and all the infants who are with him.
\v 23 And all the land are weeping — a great voice, and all the people are passing over; and the king is passing over through the brook Kidron, and all the people are passing over on the front of the way of the wilderness;
\v 24 and behold, also Zadok, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God, and they make the ark of God firm, and Abiathar went up, till the completion of all the people to pass over out of the city.
\v 25 And the king said to Zadok, 'Take back the ark of God to the city; if I find grace in the eyes of Yahweh, then He had brought me back, and shewn me it and His habitation;
\v 26 and if thus He say, I have not delighted in you; here am I, He did to me as is good in His eyes.'
\v 27 And the king said unto Zadok the priest, 'Art you a seer? turn back to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar, your two sons with you;
\v 28 see you, I am tarrying in the plains of the wilderness till the coming in of a word from you to declare to me.'
\v 29 And Zadok took back — and Abiathar — the ark of God to Jerusalem, and they abide there.
\v 30 And David is going up in the ascent of the olives, going up and weeping, and he had the head covered, and he is going barefooted, and all the people who are with him have covered each his head, and have gone up, going up and weeping;
\v 31 and David declared, saying, 'Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom;' and David said, 'Make foolish, I pray Thee, the counsel of Ahithophel, O Yahweh.'
\v 32 And it came to pass, David had come unto the top, where he boweth himself to God, and behold, to meet him is Hushai the Archite, his coat rent, and earth on his head;
\v 33 and David said to him, 'If you hast passed on with me then you hast been on me for a burden,
\v 34 and if to the city you will turn back, and hast said to Absalom, Your servant I am, O king; servant of your father I am also hitherto, and now, I am also your servant; then you hast made void for me the counsel of Ahithophel;
\v 35 and are there not with you there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it had been, the whole of the matter that you hearest from the house of the king you will declare to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests.
\v 36 Lo, there with them are their two sons, Ahimaaz to Zadok, and Jonathan to Abiathar, and you have sent by their hand unto me anything that you hear.'
\v 37 And Hushai, David's friend, came in to the city, and Absalom came in to Jerusalem.
\c 16
\v 1 And David had passed on a little from the top, and behold, Ziba, servant of Mephibosheth — to meet him, and a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer-fruit, and a bottle of wine.
\v 2 And the king said unto Ziba, 'What — these to you?' and Ziba said, 'The asses for the household of the king to ride on, and the bread and the summer-fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for the wearied to drink in the wilderness.'
\v 3 And the king said, 'And where is the son of your lord?' and Ziba said unto the king, 'Lo, he is abiding in Jerusalem, for he said, To-day do the house of Israel give back to me the kingdom of my father.'
\v 4 And the king said to Ziba, 'Lo, yours are all that Mephibosheth had;' and Ziba said, 'I have bowed myself — I find grace in yours eyes, my lord, O king.'
\v 5 And king David had come in unto Bahurim, and behold, there a man is coming out, of the family of the house of Saul, and his name is Shimei, son of Gera, he came out, coming out and reviling;
\v 6 and he stoneth David with stones, and all the servants of king David, and all the people, and all the mighty men on his right and on his left.
\v 7 And thus said Shimei in his reviling, 'Go out, go out, O man of blood, and man of worthlessness!
\v 8 Yahweh had turned back on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you hast reigned, and Yahweh did give the kingdom in to the hand of Absalom your son; and behold, you are in yours evil, for a man of blood you are.'
\v 9 And Abishai son of Zeruiah said unto the king, 'Why did this dead dog revile my lord the king? let me pass over, I pray you, and I turn aside his head.'
\v 10 And the king said, 'What — to me and to you, O sons of Zeruiah? for — let him revile; even because Yahweh had said to him, Revile David; and who said, Wherefore hast You done so?'
\v 11 And David said unto Abishai, and unto all his servants, 'Lo, my son who came out of my bowels is seeking my life, and also surely now the Benjamite; leave him alone, and let him revile, for Yahweh had said so to him;
\v 12 it may be Yahweh did look on mine affliction, and Yahweh had turned back to me good for his reviling this day.'
\v 13 And David went with his men in the way, and Shimei is going at the side of the hill over-against him, going on, and he revileth, and stoneth with stones over-against him, and had dusted with dust.
\v 14 And the king came in, and all the people who are with him, wearied, and they are refreshed there.
\v 15 And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, have come in to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him,
\v 16 and it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, 'Let the king live! let the king live!'
\v 17 And Absalom said unto Hushai, 'This your kindness with your friend! why hast you not gone with your friend?'
\v 18 And Hushai said unto Absalom, 'Nay, for he whom Yahweh had chosen, and this people, even all the men of Israel, his I am, and with him I abide;
\v 19 and secondly, for whom do I labour? is it not before his son? as I served before your father so am I before you.'
\v 20 And Absalom said unto Ahithophel, 'Give for you counsel what we do.'
\v 21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, 'Go in unto the concubines of your father, whom he left to keep the house, and all Israel had heard that you hast been abhorred by your father, and the hands of all who are with you have been strong.'
\v 22 And they spread out for Absalom the tent on the roof, and Absalom went in unto the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel.
\v 23 And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counselled in those days is as when one inquireth at the word of God; so is all the counsel of Ahithophel both to David and to Absalom.
\c 17
\v 1 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, 'Let me choose, I pray you, twelve thousand men, and I arise and pursue after David to-night,
\v 2 and come upon him, and he weary and feeble-handed, and I have caused him to tremble, and all the people have fled who are with him, and I have smitten the king by himself,
\v 3 and I bring back all the people unto you — as the turning back of the whole is the man whom you are seeking — all the people are peace.
\v 4 And the thing is right in the eyes of Absalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
\v 5 And Absalom said, 'Call, I pray you, also for Hushai the Archite, and we hear what is in his mouth — even he.'
\v 6 And Hushai came in unto Absalom, and Absalom spoke unto him, saying, 'According to this word had Ahithophel spoken; do we do his word? if not, you — speak you.'
\v 7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, 'Not good is the counsel that Ahithophel had counselled at this time.'
\v 8 And Hushai said, 'You hast known your father and his men, that they are heroes, and they are bitter in soul as a bereaved bear in a field, and your father is a man of war, and did not lodge with the people;
\v 9 behold, now, he is hidden in one of the pits, or in one of the places, and it had been, at the falling among them at the commencement, that the hearer had heard, and said, There had been a slaughter among the people who are after Absalom;
\v 10 and he also, the son of valour, whose heart is as the heart of the lion, did utterly melt, for all Israel did know that your father is a hero, and sons of valour are those with him.
\v 11 So that I have counselled: Let all Israel be diligently gathered unto you, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and you thyself are going in the middle;
\v 12 and we have come in unto him in one of the places where he is found, and we are upon him as the dew falleth on the ground, and there had not been left of him and of all the men who are with him even one.
\v 13 And if unto a city he is gathered, then they have caused all Israel to bear unto that city ropes, and we have drawn it unto the brook till that there had not been found there even a stone.'
\v 14 And Absalom said — and all the men of Israel — 'Better is the counsel of Hushai the Archite than the counsel of Ahithophel;' and Yahweh willed to make void the good counsel of Ahithophel for the sake of Yahweh's bringing unto Absalom the evil.
\v 15 And Hushai said unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests, 'Thus and thus had Ahithophel counselled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus I have counselled;
\v 16 and now, send hastily, and declare to David, saying, Lodge not to-night in the plains of the wilderness, and also, certainly pass over, lest there be a swallowing up of the king and of all the people who are with him.'
\v 17 And Jonathan and Ahimaaz are standing at En-Rogel, and the maid-servant had gone and declared to them — and they go and have declared it to king David — for they are not able to be seen to go in to the city.
\v 18 And a youth saw them, and declareth to Absalom; and they go on both of them hastily, and come in unto the house of a man in Bahurim, and he had a well in his court, and they go down there,
\v 19 and the woman took and spreadeth the covering over the face of the well, and spreadeth on it the ground corn, and the thing had not been known.
\v 20 And the servants of Absalom come in unto the woman to the house, and say, 'Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?' and the woman said to them, 'They passed over the brook of water;' and they seek, and have not found, and turn back to Jerusalem.
\v 21 And it came to pass, after their going on, that they come up out of the well, and go and declare to king David, and say unto David, 'Rise you, and pass over hastily the waters, for thus had Ahithophel counselled against you.'
\v 22 And David riseth, and all the people who are with him, and they pass over the Jordan, till the light of the morning, till one had not been lacking who had not passed over the Jordan.
\v 23 And Ahithophel had seen that his counsel was not done, and he saddleth the ass, and riseth and went unto his house, unto his city, and gave charge unto his household, and strangleth himself, and dieth, and he is buried in the burying-place of his father.
\v 24 And David came to Mahanaim, and Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him;
\v 25 and Amasa had Absalom set instead of Joab over the host, and Amasa is a man's son whose name is Ithra the Israelite who had gone in unto Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab;
\v 26 and Israel encampeth with Absalom in the land of Gilead.
\v 27 And it came to pass at the coming in of David to Mahanaim, that Shobi, son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and Machir son of Ammiel, from Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, from Rogelim,
\v 28 couch, and basin, and earthen vessel, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and roasted corn, and beans, and lentiles, and roasted pulse,
\v 29 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, have brought nigh for David, and for the people who are with him to eat, for they said, 'Your people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.'
\c 18
\v 1 And David inspecteth the people who are with him, and setteth over them heads of thousands and heads of hundreds,
\v 2 and David sent the third of the people by the hand of Joab, and the third by the hand of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, and the third by the hand of Ittai the Gittite, and the king said unto the people, 'I certainly go out — I also — with you.'
\v 3 And the people say, 'You will not go out, for if we utterly flee, they do not set their heart upon us; and if half of us die, they do not set their heart unto us — for now like us are ten thousand; and now, better that you be to us from the city for an helper.'
\v 4 And the king said unto them, 'That which is good in your eyes I do;' and the king standeth at the side of the gate, and all the people have gone out by hundreds and by thousands,
\v 5 and the king chargeth Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'Gently — for me, for the youth, for Absalom;' and all the people heard in the king's charging all the heads concerning Absalom.
\v 6 And the people went out into the field to meet Israel, and the battle is in a forest of Ephraim;
\v 7 and smitten there are the people of Israel before the servants of David, and the smiting there is great on that day — twenty thousand;
\v 8 and the battle is there scattered over the face of all the land, and the forest multiplieth to devour among the people more than those whom the sword had devoured in that day.
\v 9 And Absalom meeteth before the servants of David, and Absalom is riding on the mule, and the mule came in under an entangled bough of the great oak, and his head took hold on the oak, and he is placed between the heavens and the earth, and the mule that is under him had passed on.
\v 10 And one man saw, and declareth to Joab, and said, 'Lo, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.'
\v 11 And Joab said to the man who is declaring it to him, 'And behold, you hast seen — and wherefore did you not smite him there to the earth — and on me to give to you ten silverlings and one girdle?'
\v 12 And the man said unto Joab, 'Yea, though I am weighing on my hand a thousand silverlings, I do not put forth my hand unto the son of the king; for in our ears had the king charged you, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Observe you who is against the youth — against Absalom;
\v 13 or I had done against my soul a vain thing, and no matter is hid from the king, and you — you will station thyself over-against.'
\v 14 And Joab said, 'Not right — I tarry before you;' and he took three darts in his hand, and striketh them into the heart of Absalom, while he is alive, in the middle of the oak.
\v 15 And they go round — ten youths bearing weapons of Joab — and smite Absalom, and put him to death.
\v 16 And Joab bloweth with a trumpet, and the people turneth back from pursuing after Israel, for Joab had kept back the people;
\v 17 and they take Absalom and cast him in the forest unto the great pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones, and all Israel have fled — each to his tent.
\v 18 And Absalom had taken, and setteth up for himself in his life, the standing-pillar that is in the king's valley, for he said, 'I have no son to cause my name to be remembered;' and he called the standing-pillar by his own name, and it is called 'The monument of Absalom' unto this day.
\v 19 And Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, 'Let me run, I pray you, and I bear the king tidings, for Yahweh had delivered him out of the hand of his enemies;'
\v 20 and Joab said to him, 'You are not a man of tidings this day, but you hast borne tidings on another day, and this day you will not bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.'
\v 21 And Joab said to Cushi, 'Go, declare to the king that which you hast seen;' and Cushi boweth himself to Joab, and runneth.
\v 22 And Ahimaaz son of Zadok addeth again, and said unto Joab, 'And whatever it be, let me run, I pray you, I also, after the Cushite.' And Joab said, 'Why is this — you are running, my son, and for you there are no tidings found?' — 
\v 23 And, whatever it be, said he, let me run.' And he said to him, 'Run;' and Ahimaaz runneth the way of the circuit, and passeth by the Cushite.
\v 24 And David is sitting between the two gates, and the watchman went unto the roof of the gate, unto the wall, and lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and behold, a man running by himself.
\v 25 And the watchman called, and declareth to the king, and the king said, 'If by himself, tidings are in his mouth;' and he came, coming on and drawing near.
\v 26 And the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called unto the gatekeeper, and said, 'Lo, a man running by himself;' and the king said, 'Also this one is bearing tidings.'
\v 27 And the watchman said, 'I see the running of the first as the running of Ahimaaz son of Zadok.' And the king said, 'This is a good man, and with good tidings he came.'
\v 28 And Ahimaaz called and said unto the king, 'Peace;' and he boweth himself to the king, on his face, to the earth, and said, 'Blessed is Yahweh your God who had shut up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.'
\v 29 And the king said, 'Peace to the youth — to Absalom?' And Ahimaaz said, 'I saw the great multitude, at the sending away of the servant of the king, even your servant by Joab, and I have not known what it is.'
\v 30 And the king said, 'Turn round, station thyself here;' and he turneth round and standeth still.
\v 31 And behold, the Cushite had come, and the Cushite said, 'Let tidings be proclaimed, my lord, O king; for Yahweh had delivered you to-day out of the hand of all those rising up against you.'
\v 32 And the king said unto the Cushite, 'Peace to the youth — to Absalom?' And the Cushite said, 'Let them be — as the youth — the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have risen up against you for evil.'
\v 33 And the king trembleth, and went up on the upper chamber of the gate, and weepeth, and thus he had said in his going, 'My son! Absalom my son; my son Absalom; oh that I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son.'
\c 19
\v 1 And it is declared to Joab, 'Lo, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom;'
\v 2 and the salvation on that day became mourning to all the people, for the people had heard on that day, saying, 'The king had been grieved for his son.'
\v 3 And the people stealeth away, on that day, to go in to the city, as the people steal away, who are ashamed, in their fleeing in battle;
\v 4 and the king had covered his face, yea, the king crieth — a loud voice — 'My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son.'
\v 5 And Joab came in unto the king to the house, and said, 'You hast put to shame to-day the faces of all your servants, those delivering your life to-day, and the life of your sons, and of your daughters, and the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines,
\v 6 to love yours enemies, and to hate those loving you, for you hast declared to-day that you hast no princes and servants, for I have known to-day that if Absalom were alive, and all of us to-day dead, that then it were right in yours eyes.
\v 7 And now, rise, go out and speak unto the heart of your servants, for by Yahweh I have sworn, that — you are not going out — there did not lodge a man with you to-night; and this is worse for you than all the evil that had come upon you from your youth till now.'
\v 8 And the king riseth, and sitteth in the gate, and to all the people they have declared, saying, 'Lo, the king is sitting in the gate;' and all the people come in before the king, and Israel had fled, each to his tents.
\v 9 And it came to pass, all the people are contending through all the tribes of Israel, saying, 'The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, yea, he himself delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines, and now he had fled out of the land because of Absalom,
\v 10 and Absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle, and now, why are you silent — to bring back the king?'
\v 11 And king David sent unto Zadok and unto Abiathar the priests, saying, 'Speak you unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you last to bring back the king unto his house? (and the word of all Israel had come unto the king, unto his house;)
\v 12 my brethren you are, my bone and my flesh you are, and why are you last to bring back the king?
\v 13 And to Amasa say you, Art not you my bone and my flesh? Thus did God do to me, and thus He did add, if you are not head of the host before me all the days instead of Joab.'
\v 14 And he inclineth the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they send unto the king, 'Turn back, you, and all your servants.'
\v 15 And the king turneth back, and came in unto the Jordan, and Judah had come to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan,
\v 16 and Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite, who is from Bahurim, hasteth, and came down with the men of Judah, to meet king David,
\v 17 and a thousand men are with him from Benjamin, and Ziba servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him, and they have gone prosperously over the Jordan before the king.
\v 18 And passed over had the ferry-boat to carry over the household of the king, and to do that which is good in his eyes, and Shimei son of Gera had fallen before the king in his passing over into Jordan,
\v 19 and said unto the king, 'Let not my lord impute to me iniquity; neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely in the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, — for the king to set it unto his heart;
\v 20 for your servant had known that I have sinned; and behold, I have come to-day, first of all the house of Joseph, to go down to meet my lord the king.'
\v 21 And Abishai son of Zeruiah answereth and said, 'For this is not Shimei put to death — because he reviled the anointed of Yahweh?'
\v 22 And David said, 'What — to me and to you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you are to me to-day for an adversary? to-day is any man put to death in Israel? for have I not known that to-day I am king over Israel?'
\v 23 And the king said unto Shimei, 'You will not die;' and the king sweareth to him.
\v 24 And Mephibosheth son of Saul had come down to meet the king — and he prepared not his feet, nor did he prepare his upper lip, yea, his garments he washed not, even from the day of the going away of the king, till the day that he came in peace — 
\v 25 and it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, 'Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?'
\v 26 And he said, 'My lord, O king, my servant deceived me, for your servant said, I saddle for me the ass, and ride on it, and go with the king, for your servant is lame;
\v 27 and he uttereth slander against your servant unto my lord the king, and my lord the king is as a messenger of God; and do you that which is good in yours eyes,
\v 28 for all the house of my father have been nothing except men of death before my lord the king, and you will set your servant among those eating at your table, and what right have I any more — even to cry any more unto the king?'
\v 29 And the king said to him, 'Why will you speak any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba — share you the field.'
\v 30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, 'Yea, the whole let him take, after that my lord the king had come in peace unto his house.'
\v 31 And Barzillai the Gileadite had gone down from Rogelim, and passeth over the Jordan with the king, to send him away over the Jordan;
\v 32 and Barzillai is very aged, a son of eighty years, and he had sustained the king in his abiding in Mahanaim, for he is a very great man;
\v 33 and the king said unto Barzillai, 'Pass you over with me, and I have sustained you with me in Jerusalem.'
\v 34 And Barzillai said unto the king, 'How many are the days of the years of my life, that I go up with the king to Jerusalem?
\v 35 A son of eighty years I am to-day; do I know between good and evil? did your servant taste that which I am eating, and that which I drink? do I hearken any more to the voice of singers and songstresses? and why is your servant any more for a burden unto my lord the king?
\v 36 As a little thing, your servant did pass over the Jordan with the king, and why did the king recompense me this recompense?
\v 37 Let, I pray you, your servant turn back again, and I die in mine own city, near the burying-place of my father and of my mother, — and behold, your servant Chimham, let him pass over with my lord the king, and do you to him that which is good in yours eyes.'
\v 38 And the king said, 'With me did Chimham go over, and I do to him that which is good in yours eyes, yea, all that you will fix on me I do to you.'
\v 39 And all the people pass over the Jordan, and the king had passed over, and the king gave a kiss to Barzillai, and blessed him, and he turneth back to his place.
\v 40 And the king passeth over to Gilgal, and Chimham had passed over with him, and all the people of Judah, and they bring over the king, and also the half of the people of Israel.
\v 41 And, behold, all the men of Israel are coming unto the king, and they say unto the king, 'Wherefore have they stolen you — our brethren, the men of Judah?' (and they bring the king and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David with him).
\v 42 And all the men of Judah answer against the men of Israel, 'Because the king is near unto us, and why is this — you are displeased about this matter? have we at all eaten of the king's substance? a gift had he lifted up to us?'
\v 43 And the men of Israel answer the men of Judah, and say, 'Ten parts we have in the king, and also in David more than you; and wherefore have you lightly esteemed us, that our word had not been first to bring back our king?' And the word of the men of Judah is sharper than the word of the men of Israel.
\c 20
\v 1 And there had been called there a man of worthlessness, and his name is Sheba, son of Bichri, a Benjamite, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and said, 'We have no portion in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel.'
\v 2 And every man of Israel went up from after David, after Sheba son of Bichri, and the men of Judah have cleaved to their king, from the Jordan even unto Jerusalem.
\v 3 And David came in unto his house at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women-concubines — whom he had left to keep the house, and putteth them in a house of ward, and sustaineth them, and unto them he had not gone in, and they are shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood living.
\v 4 And the king said unto Amasa, 'Call for me the men of Judah in three days, and you, stand here,'
\v 5 and Amasa went to call Judah, and tarrieth beyond the appointed time that he had appointed him;
\v 6 and David said unto Abishai, 'Now did Sheba son of Bichri do evil to us more than Absalom; you, take the servants of your lord, and pursue after him, lest he have found for himself fenced cities, and delivered himself from our eye.'
\v 7 And the men of Joab go out after him, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite, and all the mighty men, and they go out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri;
\v 8 they are near the great stone that is in Gibeon, and Amasa had gone before them, and Joab is girded; his long robe he had put on him, and upon it a girdle — a sword is fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and he had gone out, and it falleth.
\v 9 And Joab said to Amasa, 'Art you in peace, my brother?' and the right hand of Joab laid hold on the beard of Amasa to give a kiss to him;
\v 10 and Amasa had not been watchful of the sword that is in the hand of Joab, and he smiteth him with it unto the fifth rib, and sheddeth out his bowels to the earth, and he had not repeated it to him, and he dieth; and Joab and Abishai his brother have pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.
\v 11 And a man had stood by him, of the young men of Joab, and said, 'He who had delight in Joab, and he who is for David — after Joab!'
\v 12 And Amasa is rolling himself in blood, in the middle of the highway, and the man saw that all the people have stood still, and he brought round Amasa out of the highway to the field, and threw over him a garment, when he had seen that every one who had come by him — had stood still.
\v 13 When he had been removed out of the highway, every man had passed on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.
\v 14 And he passeth over through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-Maachah, and to all the Berites, and they are assembled, and go in also after him,
\v 15 and they go in and lay siege against him, in Abel of Beth-Maachah, and cast up a mount against the city, and it standeth in a trench, and all the people who are are with Joab are destroying, to cause the wall to fall.
\v 16 And a wise woman called out of the city, 'Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, and I speak unto you.'
\v 17 And he came near unto her, and the woman said, 'Art you Joab?' and he said, 'I am.' And she said to him, 'Hear the words of your handmaid;' and he said, 'I am hearing.'
\v 18 and she spoke, saying, 'They spake often in former times, saying, Let them diligently ask at Abel, and so they finished.
\v 19 I am of the peaceable — faithful ones of Israel; you are seeking to destroy a city, and a mother in Israel; why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?
\v 20 And Joab answereth and said, 'Far be it — far be it from me; I do not swallow up nor destroy.
\v 21 The matter is not so; for a man of the hill-country of Ephraim — Sheba son of Bichri his name — had lifted up his hand against the king, against David; give you up him by himself, and I go away from the city.' And the woman said unto Joab, 'Lo, his head is cast unto you over the wall.'
\v 22 And the woman came unto all the people in her wisdom, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri, and cast it unto Joab, and he bloweth with a trumpet, and they are scattered from the city, each to his tents, and Joab had turned back to Jerusalem unto the king.
\v 23 And Joab is over all the host of Israel, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada is over the Cherethite, and over the Pelethite,
\v 24 and Adoram is over the tribute, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud is the remembrancer,
\v 25 and Sheva is scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar are priests,
\v 26 and also, Ira the Jairite had been minister to David.
\c 21
\v 1 And there is a famine in the days of David three years, year after year, and David seeketh the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh said, 'For Saul and for the bloody house, because that he put to death the Gibeonites.'
\v 2 And the king called for the Gibeonites, and said unto them — as to the Gibeonites, they are not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorite, and the sons of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul seeketh to smite them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah — 
\v 3 yea, David said unto the Gibeonites, 'What do I do for you? and with what do I make atonement? and bless you the inheritance of Yahweh.'
\v 4 And the Gibeonites say to him, 'We have no silver and gold by Saul and by his house, and we have no man to put to death in Israel;' and he said, 'What you are saying I do to you.'
\v 5 And they say unto the king, 'The man who consumed us, and who devised against us — we have been destroyed from stationing ourselves in all the border of Israel — 
\v 6 let there be given to us seven men of his sons, and we have hanged them before Yahweh, in the height of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.' And the king said, 'I do give;'
\v 7 and the king had pity on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, son of Saul, because of the oath of Yahweh that is between them, between David and Jonathan son of Saul;
\v 8 and the king took the two sons of Rizpah daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal daughter of Saul whom she bare to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite,
\v 9 and gave them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they hang them in the hill before Yahweh; and the seven fall together, and they have been put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, the commencement of barley-harvest.
\v 10 And Rizpah daughter of Aiah took the sackcloth, and stretcheth it out for herself on the rock, from the commencement of harvest till water had been poured out upon them from the heavens, and had not suffered a fowl of the heavens to rest upon them by day, or the beast of the field by night.
\v 11 And it is declared to David that which Rizpah daughter of Aiah, concubine of Saul, had done,
\v 12 and David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the possessors of Jabesh-Gilead, who had stolen them from the broad place of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines hanged them, in the day of the Philistines smiting Saul in Gilboa;
\v 13 and he brought up there the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gather the bones of those hanged,
\v 14 and bury the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin, in Zelah, in the burying-place of Kish his father, and do all that the king commanded, and God is entreated for the land afterwards.
\v 15 And again have the Philistines war with Israel, and David went down, and his servants with him, and they fight with the Philistines; and David is weary,
\v 16 and Ishbi-Benob, who is among the children of the giant — the weight of his spear is three hundred shekels weight of brass, and he is girded with a new one — spoke of smiting David,
\v 17 and Abishai son of Zeruiah gave help to him, and smiteth the Philistine, and putteth him to death; then swear the men of David to him, saying, 'You will not go out again with us to battle, nor quench the lamp of Israel.'
\v 18 And it came to pass afterwards, that the battle is again in Gob with the Philistines, then had Sibbechai the Hushadite smitten Saph, who is among the children of the giant.
\v 19 And the battle is again in Gob with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim, the Beth-Lehemite, smiteth a brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear is like a beam of weavers.
\v 20 And the battle is again in Gath, and there is a man of stature, and the fingers of his hands are six, and the toes of his feet are six, twenty and four in number, and he also had been born to the giant,
\v 21 and he reproacheth Israel, and smite him did Jonathan son of Shimeah, brother of David;
\v 22 these four have been born to the giant in Gath, and they fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
\c 22
\v 1 And David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day Yahweh had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,
\v 2 and he said: 'Yahweh is my rock, And my bulwark, and a deliverer to me,
\v 3 My God is my rock — I take refuge in Him; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, My high tower, and my refuge! My Saviour, from violence You savest me!
\v 4 The Praised One, I call Yahweh: And from mine enemies I am saved.
\v 5 When the breakers of death compassed me, The streams of the worthless terrify me,
\v 6 The cords of Sheol have surrounded me, Before me have been the snares of death.
\v 7 In mine adversity I call Yahweh, And unto my God I call, And He heareth from His temple my voice, And my cry is in His ears,
\v 8 And shake and tremble did the earth, Foundations of the heavens are troubled, And are shaken, for He had wrath!
\v 9 Gone up had smoke by His nostrils. And fire from His mouth devoureth, Brands have been kindled by it.
\v 10 And He inclineth heaven, and came down, And thick darkness is under His feet.
\v 11 And He rideth on a cherub, and did fly, And is seen on the wings of the wind.
\v 12 And He setteth darkness Round about Him — tabernacles, Darkness of waters — thick clouds of the skies.
\v 13 From the brightness before Him Were brands of fire kindled!
\v 14 Thunder from the heavens did Yahweh, And the Most High gave forth His voice.
\v 15 And He sent forth arrows, And scattereth them; Lightning, and troubleth them;
\v 16 And seen are the streams of the sea, Revealed are foundations of the world, By the rebuke of Yahweh, From the breath of the spirit of His anger.
\v 17 He sent from above — He took me, He draweth me out of many waters.
\v 18 He delivereth me from my strong enemy, From those hating me, For they were stronger than I.
\v 19 They are before me in a day of my calamity, And Yahweh is my support,
\v 20 And He brought me out to a large place, He draweth me out for He delighted in me.
\v 21 Yahweh recompenseth me, According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, He did return to me.
\v 22 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not done wickedly against my God.
\v 23 For all His judgments are before me, As to His statutes, I turn not from them.
\v 24 And I am perfect before Him, And I keep myself from mine iniquity.
\v 25 And Yahweh returneth to me, According to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His eyes.
\v 26 With the kind You shewest Yourself kind, With the perfect man You shewest Yourself perfect,
\v 27 With the pure You shewest Yourself pure, And with the perverse You shewest Yourself a wrestler.
\v 28 And the poor people You will save, And Thine eyes on the high causest to fall.
\v 29 For You are my lamp, O Yahweh, And Yahweh did lighten my darkness.
\v 30 For by Thee I run — a troop, By my God I leap a wall.
\v 31 God! Perfect is His way, The saying of Yahweh is tried, A shield He is to all those trusting in Him.
\v 32 For who is God save Yahweh? And who a Rock save our God?
\v 33 God — my bulwark, my strength, And He made perfect my way;
\v 34 Making my feet like hinds, And on my high places caused me to stand,
\v 35 Teaching my hands for battle, And brought down was a bow of brass by mine arms,
\v 36 And You givest to me the shield of Your salvation, And Your lowliness made me great.
\v 37 You enlargest my step under me, And mine ankles have not slidden.
\v 38 I pursue mine enemies and destroy them, And I turn not till they are consumed.
\v 39 And I consume them, and smite them, And they rise not, and fall under my feet.
\v 40 And You girdest me with strength for battle, You causest my withstanders to bow under me.
\v 41 And mine enemies — You givest to me the neck, Those hating me — and I cut them off.
\v 42 They look, and there is no saviour; Unto Yahweh, and He had not answered them.
\v 43 And I beat them as dust of the earth, As mire of the streets I beat them small — I spread them out!
\v 44 And — You will deliver me From the strivings of my people, You placest me for a head of nations; A people I have not known do serve me.
\v 45 Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me, At the hearing of the ear they hearken to me.
\v 46 Sons of a stranger fade away, And gird themselves by their close places.
\v 47 Yahweh lived, and blessed is my Rock, And exalted is my God — The Rock of my salvation.
\v 48 God — who is giving vengeance to me, And bringing down peoples under me,
\v 49 And bringing me forth from mine enemies, Yea, above my withstanders You raisest me up. From a man of violence You deliverest me.
\v 50 Therefore I confess Thee, O Yahweh, among nations. And to Your name I sing praise.
\v 51 Magnifying the salvations of His king, And doing loving-kindness to His anointed, To David, and to his seed — unto the age!'
\c 23
\v 1 And these are the last words of David: — 'The affirmation of David son of Jesse — And the affirmation of the man raised up — Concerning the Anointed of the God of Jacob, And the Sweetness of the Songs of Israel:
\v 2 The Spirit of Yahweh had spoken by me, And His word is on my tongue.
\v 3 He said — the God of Israel — to me, He spake — the Rock of Israel: He who is ruling over man is righteous, He is ruling in the fear of God.
\v 4 And as the light of morning he riseth, A morning sun — no clouds! By the shining, by the rain, Tender grass of the earth!
\v 5 For — not so is my house with God; For — a covenant age-during He made with me, Arranged in all things, and kept; For — all my salvation, and all desire, For — He had not caused it to spring up.
\v 6 As to the worthless — As a thorn driven away are all of them, For — not by hand are they taken;
\v 7 And the man who came against them Is filled with iron and the staff of a spear, And with fire they are utterly burnt In the cessation.'
\v 8 These are the names of the mighty ones whom David had: sitting in the seat is the Tachmonite, head of the captains — he is Adino, who hardened himself against eight hundred — wounded at one time.
\v 9 And after him is Eleazar son of Dodo, son of Ahohi, of the three mighty men with David; in their exposing themselves among the Philistines — they have been gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel go up — 
\v 10 he had arisen, and smiteth among the Philistines till that his hand had been weary, and his hand cleaveth unto the sword, and Yahweh worketh a great salvation on that day, and the people turn back after him only to strip off.
\v 11 And after him is Shammah son of Agee the Hararite, and the Philistines are gathered into a company, and there is there a portion of the field full of lentiles, and the people had fled from the presence of the Philistines,
\v 12 and he stationeth himself in the middle of the portion, and delivereth it, and smiteth the Philistines, and Yahweh worketh a great salvation.
\v 13 And three of the thirty heads go down and come unto the harvest, unto David, unto the cave of Adullam, and the company of the Philistines are encamping in the valley of Rephaim,
\v 14 and David is then in a fortress, and the station of the Philistines is then in Beth-Lehem,
\v 15 and David longeth and said, 'Who did give me a drink of the water of the well of Beth-Lehem, which is by the gate?'
\v 16 And the three mighty ones cleave through the camp of the Philistines, and draw water out of the well of Beth-Lehem, which is by the gate, and take it up, and bring in unto David; and he was not willing to drink it, and poureth it out to Yahweh,
\v 17 and said, 'Far be it from me, O Yahweh, to do this; is it the blood of the men who are going with their lives?' and he was not willing to drink it; these things did the three mighty ones.
\v 18 And Abishai brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah, he is head of three, and he is lifting up his spear against three hundred — wounded, and he had a name among three.
\v 19 Of the three is he not the honoured? and he became their head; and unto the first three he had not come.
\v 20 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada (son of a man of valour, great in deeds from Kabzeel), he had smitten two lion-like men of Moab, and he had gone down and smitten the lion in the middle of the pit in a day of snow.
\v 21 And he had smitten the Egyptian man, a man of appearance, and in the hand of the Egyptian is a spear, and he went down unto him with a rod, and took violently away the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slaid him with his own spear.
\v 22 These things had Benaiah son of Jehoiada done, and had a name among three mighty.
\v 23 Of the thirty he is honoured, and unto the three he came not; and David setteth him over his guard.
\v 24 Asahel brother of Joab is of the thirty; Elhanan son of Dodo of Beth-Lehem.
\v 25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\v 26 Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\v 27 Abiezer the Annethothite, Mebunnai the Hushadite,
\v 28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophadite,
\v 29 Heleb son of Baanah the Netophadite, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,
\v 30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
\v 31 Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
\v 32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
\v 33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
\v 34 Eliphelet son of Ahasbai, son of the Maachadite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
\v 35 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
\v 36 Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
\v 37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, bearer of the weapons of Joab son of Zeruiah,
\v 38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
\v 39 Uriah the Hittite; in all thirty and seven.
\c 24
\v 1 And the anger of Yahweh addeth to burn against Israel, and an adversary moveth David about them, saying, 'Go, number Israel and Judah.'
\v 2 And the king said unto Joab, head of the host that is with him, 'Go to and fro, I pray you, through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, and inspect you the people — and I have known the number of the people.'
\v 3 And Joab said unto the king, 'Yea, Yahweh your God did add unto the people, as they are, a hundred times, and the eyes of my lord the king are seeing; and my lord the king, why is he desirous of this thing?'
\v 4 And the word of the king is severe towards Joab, and against the heads of the force, and Joab went out, and the heads of the force, from before the king to inspect the people, even Israel;
\v 5 and they pass over the Jordan, and encamp in Aroer, on the right of the city that is in the middle of the brook of Gad, and unto Jazer,
\v 6 and they come in to Gilead, and unto the land of Tahtim-Hodshi, and they come in to Dan-Jaan, and round about unto Zidon,
\v 7 and they come in to the fortress of Tyre, and all the cities of the Hivite, and of the Canaanite, and go out unto the south of Judah, to Beer-Sheba.
\v 8 And they go to and fro through all the land, and come in at the end of nine months and twenty days to Jerusalem,
\v 9 and Joab gave the account of the inspection of the people unto the king, and Israel is eight hundred thousand men of valour, drawing sword, and the men of Judah five hundred thousand men.
\v 10 And the heart of David smiteth him, after that he had numbered the people, and David said unto Yahweh, 'I have sinned greatly in that which I have done, and now, O Yahweh, cause to pass away, I pray Thee, the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.'
\v 11 And David riseth in the morning, and the word of Yahweh had been unto Gad the prophet, seer of David, saying,
\v 12 Go, and you hast spoken unto David, Thus said Yahweh: Three — I am lifting up for you, choose you one of them, and I do it to you.'
\v 13 And Gad came in unto David, and declareth to him, and said to him, 'Do seven years of famine come in to you in your land? or three months are you fleeing before yours adversary — and he pursuing you? or are three days' pestilence in your land? now, know and see what word I take back to Him sending me.'
\v 14 And David said unto Gad, 'I have great distress, let us fall, I pray you, into the hand of Yahweh, for many are His mercies, and into the hand of man let me not fall.'
\v 15 And Yahweh gave a pestilence on Israel from the morning even unto the time appointed, and there die of the people, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, seventy thousand men,
\v 16 and the messenger putteth forth his hand to Jerusalem to destroy it, and Yahweh repenteth concerning the evil, and said to the messenger who is destroying among the people, 'Enough, now, cease your hand;' and the messenger of Yahweh was near the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\v 17 And David spoke unto Yahweh, when he saw the messenger who is smiting among the people, and said, 'Lo, I have sinned, yea, I have done perversely; and these — the flock — what have they done? Let, I pray Thee, Your hand be on me, and on the house of my father.'
\v 18 And Gad came in unto David on that day, and said to him, 'Go up, raise to Yahweh an altar in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite;'
\v 19 and David went up, according to the word of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
\v 20 And Araunah looketh, and saw the king and his servants passing over unto him, and Araunah went out and boweth himself to the king — his face to the earth.
\v 21 And Araunah said, 'Wherefore had my lord the king come unto his servant?' and David said, 'To buy from you the threshing-floor, to build an altar to Yahweh, and the plague is restrained from the people.'
\v 22 And Araunah said unto David, 'Let my lord the king take and cause to ascend that which is good in his eyes; see, the oxen for a burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments, and the instruments of the oxen, for wood;'
\v 23 the whole had Araunah given, as a king to a king; and Araunah said unto the king, 'Yahweh your God did accept you.'
\v 24 And the king said unto Araunah, 'Nay, for I do surely buy from you for a price, and I do not cause to ascend to Yahweh my God burnt-offerings for nought;' and David buyeth the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver,
\v 25 and David built there an altar to Yahweh, and caused to ascend burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and Yahweh is entreated for the land, and the plague is restrained from Israel.
