\v 1 And Moab transgresseth against Israel after the death of Ahab,
\v 2 and Ahaziah falleth through the lattice in his upper chamber that is in Samaria, and is sick, and sent messengers, and said unto them, 'Go ye, inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron if I recover from this sickness.'
\v 3 And a messenger of Yahweh had spoken unto Elijah the Tishbite, 'Rise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and speak unto them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel — ye are going to inquire of Baal Zebub god of Ekron?
\v 4 and therefore, thus said Yahweh, The bed whither you hast gone up, you will not come down from it, for you will certainly die;' and Elijah went on.
\v 5 And the messengers turn back unto him, and he said unto them, 'What is this — ye have turned back!'
\v 6 And they say unto him, 'A man had come up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn back unto the king who sent you, and ye have said unto him, Thus said Yahweh, Is it because there is not a God in Israel — you art sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? therefore, the bed whither you hast gone up, you will not come down from it, for you will certainly die.'
\v 7 And he said unto them, 'What is the fashion of the man who had come up to meet you, and spoke unto you these words?'
\v 8 And they say unto him, 'A man — hairy, and a girdle of skin girt about his loins;' and he said, 'He is Elijah the Tishbite.'
\v 9 And he sent unto him a head of fifty and his fifty, and he went up unto him (and lo, he is sitting on the top of the hill), and he spoke unto him, 'O man of God, the king had spoken, Come down.'
\v 10 And Elijah answereth and spoke unto the head of the fifty, 'And if I am a man of God, fire did come down from the heavens, and consume thee and your fifty;' and fire came down from the heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty.
\v 11 And he turneth and sent unto him another head of fifty and his fifty, and he answereth and spoke unto him, 'O man of God, thus said the king, Haste, come down.'
\v 12 And Elijah answereth and spoke unto them, 'If I am a man of God, fire did come down from the heavens, and consume thee and your fifty;' and fire of God came down from the heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty.
\v 13 And he turneth and sent a third head of fifty and his fifty, and the third head of fifty went up, and came in, and boweth on his knees over-against Elijah, and made supplication unto him, and spoke unto him, 'O man of God, let be precious, I pray thee, my soul and the soul of your servants — these fifty — in yours eyes.
\v 14 Lo, come down had fire from the heavens, and consumeth the two heads of the former fifties and their fifties; and, now, let my soul be precious in yours eyes.'
\v 15 And a messenger of Yahweh spoke unto Elijah, 'Go down with him, be not afraid of him;' and he riseth and went down with him unto the king,
\v 16 and spoke unto him, 'Thus said Yahweh, Because that you hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron — is it because there is not a God in Israel to inquire of His word? therefore, the bed whither you hast gone up — you will not come down from it, for you will certainly die.'
\v 17 And he dieth, according to the word of Yahweh that Elijah spake, and Jehoram reigneth in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, for he had no son.
\v 18 And the rest of the matters of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\c 2
\v 1 And it came to pass, at Yahweh's taking up Elijah in a whirlwind to the heavens, that Elijah went, and Elisha, from Gilgal,
\v 2 and Elijah said unto Elisha, 'Abide, I pray thee, here, for Yahweh had sent me unto Beth-El;' and Elisha said, 'Yahweh lived, and your soul lived, if I leave thee;' and they go down to Beth-El.
\v 3 And sons of the prophets who are in Beth-El come out unto Elisha, and say unto him, 'Hast you known that to-day Yahweh is taking your lord from your head?' and he said, 'I also have known — keep silent.'
\v 4 And Elijah said to him, 'Elisha, abide, I pray thee, here, for Yahweh had sent me to Jericho;' and he said, 'Yahweh lived, and your soul lived, if I leave thee;' and they come in to Jericho.
\v 5 And sons of the prophets who are in Jericho come nigh unto Elisha, and say unto him, 'Hast you known that to-day Yahweh is taking your lord from your head?' and he said, 'I also have known — keep silent.'
\v 6 And Elijah said to him, 'Abide, I pray thee, here, for Yahweh had sent me to the Jordan;' and he said, 'Yahweh lived, and your soul lived, if I leave thee;' and they go on both of them,
\v 7  — and fifty men of the sons of the prophets have gone on, and stand over-against afar off — and both of them have stood by the Jordan.
\v 8 And Elijah taketh his robe, and wrappeth it together, and smiteth the waters, and they are halved, hither and thither, and they pass over both of them on dry land.
\v 9 And it came to pass, at their passing over, that Elijah had said unto Elisha, 'Ask, what do I do for thee before I am taken from thee?' and Elisha said, 'Then let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of your spirit unto me;'
\v 10 and he said, 'Thou hast asked a hard thing; if you will see me taken from thee, it is to thee so; and if not, it is not.'
\v 11 And it came to pass, they are going, going on and speaking, and lo, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and they separate between them both, and Elijah went up in a whirlwind, to the heavens.
\v 12 And Elisha is seeing, and he is crying, 'My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen;' and he had not seen him again; and he taketh hold on his garments, and rendeth them into two pieces.
\v 13 And he taketh up the robe of Elijah, that fell from off him, and turneth back and standeth on the edge of the Jordan,
\v 14 and he taketh the robe of Elijah that fell from off him, and smiteth the waters, and said, 'Where is Yahweh, God of Elijah — even He?' and he smiteth the waters, and they are halved, hither and thither, and Elisha passeth over.
\v 15 And they see him — the sons of the prophets who are in Jericho — over-against, and they say, 'Rested had the spirit of Elijah on Elisha;' and they come to meet him, and bow themselves to him to the earth,
\v 16 and say unto him, 'Lo, we pray thee, there are with your servants fifty men, sons of valour: let them go, we pray thee, and they seek your lord, lest the Spirit of Yahweh had taken him up, and did cast him on one of the hills, or into one of the valleys;' and he said, 'Ye do not send.'
\v 17 And they press upon him, till he is ashamed, and he said, 'Send ye;' and they send fifty men, and they seek three days, and have not found him;
\v 18 and they turn back unto him — and he is abiding in Jericho — and he said unto them, 'Did I not say unto you, Do not go?'
\v 19 And the men of the city say unto Elisha, 'Lo, we pray thee, the site of the city is good, as my lord saw, and the waters are bad, and the earth sterile.'
\v 20 And he said, 'Bring to me a new dish, and place there salt;' and they bring it unto him,
\v 21 and he went out unto the source of the waters, and threw there salt, and said, 'Thus said Yahweh, I have given healing to these waters; there is not there any more death and sterility.'
\v 22 And the waters are healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha, that he spake.
\v 23 And he went up there to Beth-El, and he is going up in the way, and little youths have come out from the city, and scoff at him, and say to him, 'Go up, bald-head! go up, bald-head!'
\v 24 And he looketh behind him, and saw them, and declareth them vile in the name of Yahweh, and two bears come out of the forest, and rend of them forty and two lads.
\v 25 And he went there unto the hill of Carmel, and there he had turned back to Samaria.
\c 3
\v 1 And Jehoram son of Ahab had reigned over Israel, in Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigneth twelve years,
\v 2 and did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, only not like his father, and like his mother, and he turneth aside the standing-pillar of Baal that his father made;
\v 3 only to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused Israel to sin he had cleaved, he had not turned aside from it.
\v 4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered to the king of Israel a hundred yousand lambs, and a hundred yousand rams, with wool,
\v 5 and it came to pass at the death of Ahab, that the king of Moab transgresseth against the king of Israel.
\v 6 And king Jehoram went out in that day from Samaria, and inspecteth all Israel,
\v 7 and went and sent unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, 'The king of Moab had transgressed against me; will you go with me unto Moab for battle?' and he said, 'I go up, as I, so you; as my people, so your people; as my horses, so your horses.
\v 8 And he said, 'Where is this — the way we go up?' and he said, 'The way of the wilderness of Edom.'
\v 9 And the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and they turn round the way seven days, and there had been no water for the camp, and for the cattle that are at their feet,
\v 10 and the king of Israel said, 'Alas, for Yahweh had called for these three kings, to give them into the hand of Moab.'
\v 11 And Jehoshaphat said, 'Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, and we seek Yahweh by him?' And one of the servants of the king of Israel answereth and said, 'Here is Elisha son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.'
\v 12 And Jehoshaphat said, 'The word of Yahweh is with him;' and go down unto him do the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom.
\v 13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, 'What — to me and to thee? go unto the prophets of your father, and unto the prophets of your mother;' and the king of Israel said to him, 'Nay, for Yahweh had called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.'
\v 14 And Elisha said, 'Yahweh of Hosts lived, before whom I have stood; for unless the face of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I am lifting up, I do not look unto thee, nor see thee;
\v 15 and now, bring to me a minstrel; and it had been, at the playing of the minstrel, that the hand of Yahweh is on him,
\v 16 and he said, 'Thus said Yahweh, Make this valley ditches — ditches;
\v 17 for thus said Yahweh, Ye do not see wind, nor do ye see rain, and that valley is full of water, and ye have drunk — ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
\v 18 'And this had been light in the eyes of Yahweh, and he had given Moab into your hand,
\v 19 and ye have smitten every fenced city, and every choice city, and every good tree ye cause to fall, and all fountains of waters ye stop, and every good portion ye mar with stones.'
\v 20 And it came to pass in the morning, at the ascending of the morning -present, that lo, waters are coming in from the way of Edom, and the land is filled with the waters,
\v 21 and all Moab have heard that the kings have come up to fight against them, and they are called together, from every one girding on a girdle and upward, and they stand by the border.
\v 22 And they rise early in the morning, and the sun had shone on the waters, and the Moabites see, from over-against, the waters red as blood,
\v 23 and say, 'Blood this is; the kings have been surely destroyed, and they smite each his neighbour; and now for spoil, Moab!'
\v 24 And they come in unto the camp of Israel, and the Israelites rise, and smite the Moabites, and they flee from their face; and they enter into Moab, so as to smite Moab,
\v 25 and the cities they break down, and on every good portion they cast each his stone, and have filled it, and every fountain of water they stop, and every good tree they cause to fall — till one had left its stones in Kir-Haraseth, and the slingers go round and smite it.
\v 26 And the king of Moab saw that the battle has been too strong for him, and he taketh with him seven hundred men, drawing sword, to cleave through unto the king of Edom, and they have not been able,
\v 27 and he taketh his son, the first-born who reigneth in his stead, and caused him to ascend — a burnt-offering on the wall, and there is great wrath against Israel, and they journey from off him, and turn back to the land.

\v 1 And a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets had cried unto Elisha, saying, 'Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you hast known that your servant was fearing Yahweh, and the lender had come to take my two children to him for servants.'
\v 2 And Elisha said unto her, 'What do I do for thee? declare to me, what hast you in the house?' and she said, 'Your maid-servant had nothing in the house except a pot of oil.'
\v 3 And he said, 'Go, ask for thee vessels from wiyout, from all your neighbours — empty vessels — let them not be few;
\v 4 and you hast entered, and shut the door upon thee, and upon your sons, and hast poured out into all these vessels, and the full ones you will remove.'
\v 5 And she went from him, and shutteth the door upon her, and upon her sons; they are bringing nigh unto her, and she is pouring out,
\v 6 and it came to pass, at the filling of the vessels, that she said unto her son, 'Bring nigh unto me a vessel more,' and he said unto her, 'There is not a vessel more;' and the oil stayeth.
\v 7 And she came and declareth to the man of God, and he said, 'Go, sell the oil, and repay your loan; and you and your sons do live of the rest.'
\v 8 And the day came that Elisha passeth over unto Shunem, and there is a great woman, and she laid hold on him to eat bread, and it came to pass, at the time of his passing over, he turneth aside thither to eat bread,
\v 9 and she said unto her husband, 'Lo, I pray thee, I have known that a holy man of God he is, passing over by us continually;
\v 10 let us make, I pray thee, a little upper chamber of the wall, and we set for him there a bed, and a table, and a high seat, and a candlestick; and it had been, in his coming in unto us, he did turn aside thither.'
\v 11 And the day came, that he came in thither, and turneth aside unto the upper chamber, and lieth there,
\v 12 and he said unto Gehazi his young man, 'Call for this Shunammite;' and he called for her, and she standeth before him.
\v 13 And he said to him, 'Say, I pray thee, unto her, Lo, you hast troubled yourself concerning us with all this trouble; what — to do for thee? is it to speak for thee unto the king, or unto the head of the host?' and she said, 'In the middle of my people I am dwelling.'
\v 14 And he said, 'And what — to do for her?' and Gehazi said, 'Verily she had no son, and her husband is aged.'
\v 15 And he said, 'Call for her;' and he called for her, and she standeth at the opening,
\v 16 and he said, 'At this season, according to the time of life, you art embracing a son;' and she said, 'Nay, my lord, O man of God, do not lie unto your maid-servant.'
\v 17 And the woman conceiveth and beareth a son, at this season, according to the time of life, that Elisha spake of unto her.
\v 18 And the lad groweth, and the day came that he went out unto his father, unto the reapers,
\v 19 and he said unto his father, 'My head, my head;' and he said unto the young man, 'Bear him unto his mother;'
\v 20 and he beareth him, and brought him in unto his mother, and he sitteth on her knees till the noon, and dieth.
\v 21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shutteth the door upon him, and went out,
\v 22 and called unto her husband, and said, 'Send, I pray thee, to me, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I run unto the man of God, and return.'
\v 23 And he said, 'Wherefore art you going unto him to-day? — neither new moon nor sabbath!' and she said, 'Peace to thee!'
\v 24 And she saddleth the ass, and said unto her young man, 'Lead, and go, do not restrain riding for me, except I have said so to thee.'
\v 25 And she went, and came in unto the man of God, unto the hill of Carmel, and it came to pass, at the man of God's seeing her from over-against, that he said unto Gehazi his young man, 'Lo, this Shunammite;
\v 26 now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is there peace to thee? is there peace to your husband? is there peace to the lad?' and she said, 'Peace.'
\v 27 And she came in unto the man of God, unto the hill, and laid hold on his feet, and Gehazi came nigh to thrust her away, and the man of God said, 'Let her alone, for her soul is bitter to her, and Yahweh had hidden it from me, and had not declared it to me.'
\v 28 And she said, 'Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?'
\v 29 And he said to Gehazi, 'Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go; when you will meet a man, you will not salute him; and when a man did salute thee, you will not answer him; and you hast laid my staff on the face of the youth.'
\v 30 And the mother of the youth said, 'Yahweh lived, and your soul lived — if I leave thee;' and he riseth and went after her.
\v 31 And Gehazi had passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the youth, and there is no voice, and there is no attention, and he turneth back to meet him, and declareth to him, saying, 'The youth had not awaked.'
\v 32 And Elisha came in to the house, and lo, the youth is dead, laid on his bed,
\v 33 and he went in and shutteth the door upon them both, and prayeth unto Yahweh.
\v 34 And he went up, and lieth down on the lad, and putteth his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands, and stretcheth himself upon him, and the flesh of the lad became warm;
\v 35 and he turneth back and walketh in the house, once hither and once thither, and went up and stretcheth himself upon him, and the youth sneezeth till seven times, and the youth opened his eyes.
\v 36 And he called unto Gehazi, and said, 'Call unto this Shunammite;' and he called her, and she came in unto him, and he said, 'Lift up your son.'
\v 37 And she went in, and falleth at his feet, and boweth herself to the earth, and lifteth up her son, and went out.
\v 38 And Elisha had turned back to Gilgal, and the famine is in the land, and the sons of the prophets are sitting before him, and he said to his young man, 'Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.'
\v 39 And one went out unto the field to gather herbs, and findeth a vine of the field, and gathereth of it gourds of the field — the fulness of his garment — and came in and splitteth them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not;
\v 40 and they pour out for the men to eat, and it came to pass at their eating of the pottage, that they have cried out, and say, 'Death is in the pot, O man of God!' and they have not been able to eat.
\v 41 And he said, 'Then bring ye meal;' and he threw into the pot, and said, 'Pour out for the people, and they eat;' and there was no evil thing in the pot.
\v 42 And a man had come from Baal-Shalishah, and brought in to the man of God bread of first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in its husk, and he said, 'Give to the people, and they eat.'
\v 43 And his minister said, 'What — do I give this before a hundred men?' and he said, 'Give to the people, and they eat, for thus said Yahweh, Eat and leave;'
\v 44 and he gave before them, and they eat and leave, according to the word of Yahweh.

\v 1 And Naaman, head of the host of the king of Aram, was a great man before his lord, and accepted of face, for by him had Yahweh given salvation to Aram, and the man was mighty in valour — leprous.
\v 2 And the Aramaeans have gone out by troops, and they take captive out of the land of Israel a little damsel, and she is before the wife of Naaman,
\v 3 and she said unto her mistress, 'O that my lord were before the prophet who is in Samaria; then he did recover him from his leprosy.'
\v 4 And one went in and declareth to his lord, saying, 'Thus and thus she had spoken, the damsel who is from the land of Israel.'
\v 5 And the king of Aram said, 'Go you, enter, and I send a letter unto the king of Israel;' and he went and taketh in his hand ten talents of silver, and six yousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of garments.
\v 6 And he brought in the letter unto the king of Israel, saying, 'And now, at the coming in of this letter unto thee, lo, I have sent unto thee Naaman my servant, and you hast recovered him from his leprosy.'
\v 7 And it came to pass, at the king of Israel's reading the letter, that he rendeth his garments, and said, 'Am I God, to put to death and to keep alive, that this one is sending unto me to recover a man from his leprosy? for surely know, I pray you, and see, for he is presenting himself to me.'
\v 8 And it came to pass, at Elisha the man of God's hearing that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent unto the king, saying, 'Why hast you rent your garments? let him come, I pray thee, unto me, and he did know that there is a prophet in Israel.'
\v 9 And Naaman came, with his horses and with his chariot, and standeth at the opening of the house for Elisha;
\v 10 and Elisha sent unto him a messenger, saying, 'Go, and you hast washed seven times in Jordan, and your flesh did turn back to thee — and be you clean.
\v 11 And Naaman is wroth, and went on, and said, 'Lo, I said, Unto me he did certainly come out, and had stood and called in the name of Yahweh his God, and waved his hand over the place, and recovered the leper.
\v 12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? do I not wash in them and I have been clean?' and he turneth and went on in fury.
\v 13 And his servants come nigh, and speak unto him, and say, 'My father, a great thing had the prophet spoken unto thee — will you not do it? and surely, when he had said unto thee, Wash, and be clean.'
\v 14 And he went down and dippeth in Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh did turn back as the flesh of a little youth, and is clean.
\v 15 And he turneth back unto the man of God, he and all his camp, and came in, and standeth before him, and said, 'Lo, I pray thee, I have known that there is not a God in all the earth except in Israel; and now, take, I pray thee, a blessing from your servant.'
\v 16 And he said, 'Yahweh lived, before whom I have stood — if I take it;' and he presseth on him to take, and he refuseth.
\v 17 And Naaman said, 'If not — let be given, I pray thee, to your servant, a couple of mules' burden of earth, for your servant did make no more burnt-offering and sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.
\v 18 For this thing Yahweh be propitious to your servant, in the coming in of my lord into the house of Rimmon to bow himself there, and he was supported by my hand, and I bowed myself in the house of Rimmon; for my bowing myself in the house of Rimmon Yahweh be propitious, I pray thee, to your servant in this thing.'
\v 19 And he said to him, 'Go in peace.' And he went from him a kibrath of land,
\v 20 And Gehazi, servant of Elisha the man of God, said, 'Lo, my lord had spared Naaman this Aramaean, not to receive from his hand that which he brought; Yahweh lived; surely if I have run after him, then I have taken from him something.'
\v 21 And Gehazi pursueth after Naaman, and Naaman saw one running after him, and alighteth from off the chariot to meet him, and said, 'Is there peace?'
\v 22 And he said, 'Peace; my lord had sent me, saying, Lo, now, this, come unto me have two young men from the hill-country of Ephraim, of the sons of the prophets; give, I pray thee, to them, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.'
\v 23 And Naaman said, 'Be pleased, take two talents;' and he urgeth on him, and bindeth two talents of silver in two purses, and two changes of garments, and gave unto two of his young men, and they bear before him;
\v 24 and he came in unto the high place, and taketh out of their hand, and laid up in the house, and sent away the men, and they go.
\v 25 And he had come in, and did stand by his lord, and Elisha said unto him, 'Whence — Gehazi?' and he said, 'Your servant went not hither or thither.'
\v 26 And he said unto him, 'My heart went not when the man turned from off his chariot to meet thee; is it a time to take silver, and to take garments, and olives, and vines, and flock, and herd, and men-servants, and maid-servants?
\v 27 yea, the leprosy of Naaman did cleave to thee, and to your seed, — to the age;' and he went out from before him — leprous as snow.
\c 6
\v 1 And sons of the prophet say unto Elisha, 'Lo, we pray thee, the place where we are dwelling before thee is too strait for us;
\v 2 let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and we take there each one beam, and we make for ourselves there a place to dwell there;' and he said, 'Go.'
\v 3 And the one said, 'Be pleased, I pray thee, and go with your servants;' and he said, 'I — I go.'
\v 4 And he went with them, and they come in to the Jordan, and cut down the trees,
\v 5 and it came to pass, the one is felling the beam, and the iron had fallen into the water, and he crieth and said, 'Alas! my lord, and it asked!'
\v 6 And the man of God said, 'Whither had it fallen?' and he sheweth him the place, and he cutteth a stick, and threw thither, and caused the iron to swim,
\v 7 and said, 'Raise to thee;' and he putteth forth his hand and taketh it.
\v 8 And the king of Aram had been fighting against Israel, and taketh counsel with his servants, saying, 'At such and such a place is my encamping.'
\v 9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, 'Take heed of passing by this place, for thither are the Aramaeans coming down;
\v 10 and the king of Israel sent unto the place of which the man of God spake to him, and warned him, and he is preserved there not once nor twice.
\v 11 And the heart of the king of Aram is tossed about concerning this thing, and he called unto his servants, and said unto them, 'Do ye not declare to me who of us is for the king of Israel?'
\v 12 And one of his servants said, 'Nay, my lord, O king, for Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel, declareth to the king of Israel the words that you speakest in the inner part of your bed-chamber.'
\v 13 And he said, 'Go ye and see where he is, and I send and take him;' and it is declared to him, saying, 'Lo — in Dothan.'
\v 14 And he sent thither horses and chariot, and a heavy force, and they come in by night, and go round against the city.
\v 15 And the servant of the man of God riseth early, and went out, and lo, a force is surrounding the city, and horse and chariot, and his young man said unto him, 'Alas! my lord, how do we do?'
\v 16 And he said, 'Fear not, for more are they who are with us than they who are with them.'
\v 17 And Elisha prayeth, and said, 'Yahweh, open, I pray Thee, his eyes, and he did see;' and Yahweh opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and lo, the hill is full of horses and chariots of fire, round about Elisha.
\v 18 And they come down unto it, and Elisha prayeth unto Yahweh, and said, 'Smite, I pray Thee, this nation with blindness;' and He smiteth them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.
\v 19 And Elisha said unto them, 'This is not the way, nor is this the city; come after me, and I lead you unto the man whom ye seek;' and he leadeth them to Samaria.
\v 20 And it came to pass, at their coming in to Samaria, that Elisha said, 'Yahweh, open the eyes of these, and they see;' and Yahweh opened their eyes, and they see, and lo, in the middle of Samaria!
\v 21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, at his seeing them, 'Do I smite — do I smite — my father?'
\v 22 And he said, 'Thou will not smite; those whom you hast taken captive with your sword and with your bow art you smiting? set bread and water before them, and they eat, and drink, and go unto their lord.'
\v 23 And he prepared for them great provision, and they eat and drink, and he sent them away, and they go unto their lord: and troops of Aram have not added any more to come in to the land of Israel.
\v 24 And it came to pass afterwards, that Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathereth all his camp, and went up, and laid siege to Samaria,
\v 25 and there is a great famine in Samaria, and lo, they are laying siege to it, till the head of an ass is at eighty silverlings, and a forth of the cab of dovesdung at five silverlings.
\v 26 And it came to pass, the king of Israel is passing by on the wall, and a woman had cried unto him, saying, 'Save, my lord, O king.'
\v 27 And he said, 'Yahweh did not save thee — whence do I save thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the wine-vat?'
\v 28 And the king said to her, 'What — to thee?' and she said, 'This woman said unto me, Give your son, and we eat him to-day, and my son we eat to-morrow;
\v 29 and we boil my son and eat him, and I say unto her on the next day, Give your son, and we eat him; and she hideth her son.'
\v 30 And it came to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the woman, that he rendeth his garments, and he is passing by on the wall, and the people see, and lo, the sackcloth is on his flesh within.
\v 31 And he said, 'Thus did God do to me, and thus He did add — if it remain — the head of Elisha son of Shaphat — upon him this day.'
\v 32 And Elisha is sitting in his house, and the elders are sitting with him, and the king sent a man from before him; before the messenger did come unto him, even he himself said unto the elders, 'Have ye seen that this son of the murderer had sent to turn aside my head? see, at the coming in of the messenger, shut the door, and ye have held him fast at the door, is not the sound of the feet of his lord behind him?'
\v 33 He is yet speaking with them, and lo, the messenger is coming down unto him, and he said, 'Lo, this is the evil from Yahweh: what — do I wait for Yahweh any more?'
\c 7
\v 1 And Elisha said, 'Hear ye a word of Yahweh: thus said Yahweh, About this time to-morrow, a measure of fine flour is at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.'
\v 2 And the captain whom the king had, by whose hand he had been supported, answereth the man of God and said, 'Lo, Yahweh is making windows in the heavens — shall this thing be?' and he said, 'Lo, you art seeing it with yours eyes, and thereof you will not eat.'
\v 3 And four men have been leprous, at the opening of the gate, and they say one unto another, 'What — we are sitting here till we have died;
\v 4 if we have said, We go in to the city, then the famine is in the city, and we have died there; and if we have sat here, then we have died; and now, come and we fall unto the camp of Aram; if they keep us alive, we live, and if they put us to death — we have died.'
\v 5 And they rise in the twilight, to go in unto the camp of Aram, and they come in unto the extremity of the camp of Aram, and lo, there is not a man there,
\v 6 seeing Yahweh had caused the camp of Aram to hear a noise of chariot and a noise of horse — a noise of great force, and they say one unto another, 'Lo, the king of Israel had hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us.'
\v 7 And they rise and flee in the twilight, and forsake their tents, and their horses, and their asses — the camp as it is — and flee for their life.
\v 8 And these lepers come in unto the extremity of the camp, and come in unto one tent, and eat, and drink, and lift up there silver, and gold, and garments, and go and hide; and they turn back and go in unto another tent, and lift up there, and go and hide.
\v 9 And they say one unto another, 'We are not doing right this day; a day of tidings it is, and we are keeping silent; and — we have waited till the light of the morning, then had punishment found us; and now, come and we go in and declare to the house of the king.'
\v 10 And they come in, and call unto the gatekeeper of the city, and declare for themselves, saying, 'We have come in unto the camp of Aram, and lo, there is not there a man, or sound of man, but the bound horse, and the bound ass, and tents as they are.'
\v 11 and he called the gatekeepers, and they declare to the house of the king within.
\v 12 And the king riseth by night, and said unto his servants, 'Let me declare, I pray you, to you that which the Aramaeans have done to us; they have known that we are famished, and they are gone out from the camp to be hidden in the field, saying, When they come out from the city, then we catch them alive, and unto the city we enter.'
\v 13 And one of his servants answereth and said, 'Then let them take, I pray thee, five of the horses that are left, that have been left in it — lo, they are as all the multitude of Israel who have been left in it; lo, they are as all the multitude of Israel who have been consumed — and we send and see.'
\v 14 And they take two chariot-horses, and the king sent after the camp of Aram, saying, 'Go, and see.'
\v 15 And they go after them unto the Jordan, and lo, all the way is full of garments and vessels that the Aramaeans have cast away in their haste, and the messengers turn back and declare to the king.
\v 16 And the people go out and spoil the camp of Aram, and there is a measure of fine flour at a shekel, and two measures of barley at a shekel, according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 17 And the king had appointed the captain, by whose hand he is supported, over the gate, and the people tread him down in the gate, and he dieth, as the man of God spake, which he spake in the coming down of the king unto him,
\v 18 yea, it came to pass, according to the speaking of the man of God unto the king, saying, 'Two measures of barley at a shekel, and a measure of fine flour at a shekel are, at this time to-morrow, in the gate of Samaria;'
\v 19 and the captain answereth the man of God, and said, 'And lo, Yahweh is making windows in the heavens — it is according to this word?' and he said, 'Lo, you art seeing with yours eyes, and thereof you will not eat;'
\v 20 and it came to him so, and the people tread him down in the gate, and he dieth.
\c 8
\v 1 And Elisha spake unto the woman whose son he had revived, saying, 'Rise and go, you and your household, and sojourn where you will sojourn, for Yahweh had called for a famine, and also, it is coming unto the land seven years.'
\v 2 And the woman riseth, and did according to the word of the man of God, and went, she and her household, and sojourneth in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\v 3 And it came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman turneth back from the land of the Philistines, and went out to cry unto the king, for her house, and for her field.
\v 4 And the king is speaking unto Gehazi, servant of the man of God, saying, 'Recount, I pray thee, to me, the whole of the great things that Elisha had done.'
\v 5 And it came to pass, he is recounting to the king how he had revived the dead, and lo, the woman whose son he had revived is crying unto the king, for her house and for her field, and Gehazi said, 'My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this her son, whom Elisha revived.'
\v 6 And the king asketh at the woman, and she recounteth to him, and the king appointeth to her a certain eunuch, saying, 'Give back all that she had, and all the increase of the field from the day of her leaving the land even till now.'
\v 7 And Elisha came in to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram is sick, and it is declared to him, saying, 'The man of God had come hither.'
\v 8 And the king said unto Hazael, 'Take in your hand a present, and go to meet the man of God, and you hast sought Yahweh by him, saying, Do I revive from this sickness?'
\v 9 And Hazael went to meet him, and taketh a present in his hand, even of every good thing of Damascus, a burden of forty camels, and he came in and standeth before him, and said, 'Your son Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, had sent me unto thee, saying, Do I revive from this sickness?'
\v 10 And Elisha said unto him, 'Go, say, Thou will certainly not revive, seeing Yahweh had shewed me that he did surely die.'
\v 11 And he setteth his face, yea, he setteth it till he is ashamed, and the man of God weepeth.
\v 12 And Hazael said, 'Wherefore is my lord weeping?' and he said, 'Because I have known the evil that you will to the sons of Israel — their fenced places you will send into fire, and their young men with sword you will slay, and their sucklings you will dash to pieces, and their pregnant women you will rip up.'
\v 13 And Hazael said, 'But what, is your servant the dog, that he did this great thing?' And Elisha said, 'Yahweh had shewed me thee — king of Aram.'
\v 14 And he went from Elisha, and came in unto his lord, and he said unto him, 'What said Elisha to thee?' and he said, 'He said to me, Thou will certainly recover.'
\v 15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he taketh the coarse cloth, and dippeth in water, and spreadeth on his face, and he dieth, and Hazael reigneth in his stead.
\v 16 And in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel — and Jehoshaphat is king of Judah — had Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah reigned;
\v 17 a son of thirty and two years was he in his reigning, and eight years he had reigned in Jerusalem.
\v 18 And he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab was to him for a wife, and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh,
\v 19 and Yahweh was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, as He said to him, to give to him a lamp — to his sons all the days.
\v 20 In his days had Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they cause a king to reign over them,
\v 21 and Joram passeth over to Zair, and all the chariots with him, and he himself had risen by night, and smiteth Edom, that is coming round about unto him, and the heads of the chariots, and the people fleeth to its tents;
\v 22 and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah till this day; then did Libnah revolt at that time.
\v 23 And the rest of the matters of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 24 And Joram lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David, and reign did Ahaziah his son in his stead.
\v 25 In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel reigned had Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah;
\v 26 a son of twenty and two years is Ahaziah in his reigning, and one year he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Athaliah daughter of Omri king of Israel,
\v 27 and he walketh in the way of the house of Ahab, and did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, like the house of Ahab, for he is son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
\v 28 And he went with Joram son of Ahab to battle with Hazael king of Aram in Ramoth-Gilead, and the Aramaeans smite Joram,
\v 29 and Joram the king turneth back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds with which the Arameans smite him in Ramah, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram, and Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah had gone down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he is sick.
\c 9
\v 1 And Elisha the prophet had called to one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, 'Gird up your loins, and take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead,
\v 2 and you hast gone in there, and see you there Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, and you hast gone in, and caused him to rise out of the middle of his brethren, and brought him in to the inner part of an inner-chamber,
\v 3 and taken the vial of oil, and poured on his head, and said, Thus said Yahweh, I have anointed thee for king unto Israel; and you hast opened the door, and fled, and will not wait.'
\v 4 And the young man went — the young man the prophet — to Ramoth-Gilead,
\v 5 and came in, and lo, chiefs of the force are sitting, and he said, 'I have a word unto thee, O chief!' and Jehu said, 'Unto which of all of us?' and he said, 'Unto thee, O chief.'
\v 6 And he riseth and came in to the house, and he poureth the oil on his head, and said to him, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, I have anointed thee for king unto the people of Yahweh, unto Israel,
\v 7 and you hast smitten the house of Ahab your lord, and I have required the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, from the hand of Jezebel;
\v 8 and perished had all the house of Ahab, and I have cut off to Ahab those sitting on the wall, and restrained, and left, in Israel,
\v 9 and I have given up the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha son of Ahijah,
\v 10 and Jezebel do the dogs eat in the portion of Jezreel, and there is none burying;' and he opened the door and fleeth.
\v 11 And Jehu had gone out unto the servants of his lord, and one said to him, 'Is there peace? wherefore came this madman unto thee?' and he said unto them, 'Ye have known the man and his talk.'
\v 12 And they say, 'False, declare, we pray thee, to us;' and he said, 'Thus and thus spake he unto me, saying, Thus said Yahweh, I have anointed thee for king unto Israel.'
\v 13 And they haste and take each his garment, and put it under him at the top of the stairs, and blow with a trumpet, and say, 'Reigned had Jehu!'
\v 14 And Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspireth against Joram — (and Joram was keeping in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all Israel, from the presence of Hazael king of Aram,
\v 15 and king Joram turneth back to be healed in Jezreel, of the wounds with which the Aramaeans smite him, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram) — and Jehu said, 'If it is your mind, let not an escaped one go out from the city, to go to declare it in Jezreel.'
\v 16 And Jehu rideth, and went to Jezreel, for Joram is lying there, and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see Joram.
\v 17 And the watchman is standing on the tower in Jezreel, and saw the company of Jehu in his coming, and said, 'A company I see;' and Joram said, 'Take a rider and send to meet them, and let him say, Is there peace?'
\v 18 and the rider on the horse went to meet him, and said, 'Thus said the king, Is there peace?' and Jehu said, 'What — to thee and to peace? turn round behind me.' And the watchman declareth, saying, 'The messenger came unto them, and he had not returned.'
\v 19 And he sent a second rider on a horse, and he came in unto them, and said, 'Thus said the king, Is there peace?' and Jehu said, 'What — to thee and to peace? turn round behind me.'
\v 20 And the watchman declareth, saying, 'He came unto them, and he had not returned, and the driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi, for with madness he driveth.'
\v 21 And Jehoram said, 'Harness;' and his chariot is harnessed, and Jehoram king of Israel went out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each in his chariot, and they go out to meet Jehu, and find him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\v 22 And it came to pass, at Jehoram's seeing Jehu, that he said, 'Is there peace, Jehu?' and he said, 'What is the peace, while the whoredoms of Jezebel your mother, and her witchcrafts, are many?'
\v 23 And Jehoram turneth his hands, and fleeth, and said unto Ahaziah, 'Deceit, O Ahaziah!'
\v 24 And Jehu had filled his hand with a bow, and smiteth Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out from his heart, and he boweth down in his chariot.
\v 25 And Jehu said unto Bidkar his captain, 'Lift up, cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite — for, remember, I and you were riding together after Ahab his father, and Yahweh lifted upon him this burden:
\v 26 Have I not the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons seen yesternight — the affirmation of Yahweh — yea, I have recompensed to thee in this portion — the affirmation of Yahweh; — and now, lift up, cast him into the portion, according to the word of Yahweh.'
\v 27 And Ahaziah king of Judah had seen, and fleeth the way of the garden-house, and Jehu pursueth after him, and said, 'Smite him — also him — in the chariot,' in the going up to Gur, that is Ibleam, and he fleeth to Megiddo, and dieth there,
\v 28 and his servants carry him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and bury him in his burying-place, with his fathers, in the city of David.
\v 29 And in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab reign did Ahaziah over Judah.
\v 30 And Jehu came in to Jezreel, and Jezebel had heard, and putteth her eyes in paint and made right her head, and looketh out through the window.
\v 31 And Jehu had come into the gate, and she said, 'Was there peace to Zimri — slayer of his lord?'
\v 32 And he lifteth up his face unto the window, and said, 'Who is with me? — who?' and look out unto him do two or three eunuchs;
\v 33 And he said, 'Let her go;' and they let her go, and some of her blood is sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses, and he treadeth her down.
\v 34 And he came in, and eateth, and drinketh, and said, 'Look after, I pray you, this cursed one, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.'
\v 35 And they go to bury her, and have not found of her except the skull, and the feet, and the palms of the hands.
\v 36 And they turn back, and declare to him, and he said, 'The word of Yahweh it is, that He spake by the hand of this servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel do the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel,
\v 37 and the carcase of Jezebel had been as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, that they say not, This is Jezebel.'
\c 10
\v 1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria, and Jehu writeth letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the heads of Jezreel, the elders, and unto the supporters of Ahab, saying,
\v 2 And now, at the coming in of this letter unto you, and with you are sons of your lord, and with you are the chariots and the horses, and a fenced city, and the armour,
\v 3 and ye have seen the best and the uprightest of the sons of your lord, and have set him on the throne of his father, and fight ye for the house of your lord.'
\v 4 And they fear very greatly, and say, 'Lo, the two kings have not stood before him, and how do we stand — we?'
\v 5 And he who is over the house, and he who is over the city, and the elders, and the supporters, send unto Jehu, saying, 'Your servants we are, and all that you sayest unto us we do; we do not make any one king — that which is good in yours eyes do.'
\v 6 And he writeth unto them a letter a second time, saying, 'If ye are for me, and to my voice are hearkening, take the heads of the men — the sons of your lord, and come unto me about this time to-morrow, to Jezreel;' and the sons of the king are seventy men, with the great ones of the city those bringing them up.
\v 7 And it came to pass, at the coming in of the letter unto them, that they take the sons of the king, and slaughter seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and send unto him to Jezreel,
\v 8 and the messenger came in, and declareth to him, saying, 'They have brought in the heads of the sons of the king,' and he said, 'Make them two heaps at the opening of the gate till the morning.'
\v 9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and standeth, and said unto all the people, 'Righteous are ye; lo, I have conspired against my lord, and slay him — and who smote all these?
\v 10 Know ye now, that nothing did fall of the word of Yahweh to the earth that Yahweh spake against the house of Ahab, and Yahweh had done that which He spake by the hand of His servant Elijah.'
\v 11 And Jehu smiteth all those left to the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his acquaintances, and his priests, till he had not left to him a remnant.
\v 12 And he riseth, and came in and went to Samaria; he is at the shepherds' shearing-house in the way,
\v 13 and Jehu had found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, 'Who are ye?' and they say, 'Brethren of Ahaziah we are, and we go down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the mistress.'
\v 14 And he said, 'Catch them alive;' and they catch them alive, and slaughter them at the pit of the shearing-house, forty and two men, and he had not left a man of them.
\v 15 And he went there, and findeth Jehonadab son of Rechab — to meet him, and blessed him, and said unto him, 'Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?' and Jehonadab said, 'It is;' — 'Then it is; give your hand;' and he gave his hand, and he caused him to come up into him into the chariot,
\v 16 and said, 'Come with me, and look on my zeal for Yahweh;' and they cause him to ride in his chariot.
\v 17 And he came in to Samaria, and smiteth all those left to Ahab in Samaria, till his destroying him, according to the word of Yahweh that He spake unto Elisha.
\v 18 And Jehu gathereth the whole of the people, and said unto them, 'Ahab served Baal a little — Jehu did serve him much:
\v 19 and now, all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests, call ye unto me; let not a man be lacking, for a great sacrifice I have for Baal; every one who is lacking — he did not live;' and Jehu had done it in subtilty, in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
\v 20 And Jehu said, 'Sanctify a restraint for Baal;' and they proclaim it.
\v 21 And Jehu sent into all Israel, and all the servants of Baal come in, and there had not been left a man who had not come in; and they come in to the house of Baal, and the house of Baal is full — mouth to mouth.
\v 22 And he said to him who is over the wardrobe, 'Bring out clothing to all servants of Baal;' and he brought out to them the clothing.
\v 23 And Jehu went in, and Jehonadab son of Rechab, to the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, 'Search and see, lest there be here with you of the servants of Yahweh — but, the servants of Baal by themselves.'
\v 24 And they come in to make sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and Jehu had set for himself in an out-place eighty men, and said, 'The man who letteth escape any of the men whom I am bringing in unto your hand — his soul for his soul.'
\v 25 And it came to pass at his finishing to make the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the runners, and to the captains, 'Go in, smite them, let none come out;' and they smite them by the mouth of the sword, and the runners and the captains cast them out; and they go unto the city, to the house of Baal,
\v 26 and bring out the standing-pillars of the house of Baal, and burn them,
\v 27 and break down the standing-pillar of Baal, and break down the house of Baal, and appoint it for a draught-house unto this day.
\v 28 And Jehu destroyeth Baal out of Israel,
\v 29 only — the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, that he caused Israel to sin, Jehu had not turned aside from after them — the calves of gold that are at Beth-El, and in Dan.
\v 30 And Yahweh said unto Jehu, 'Because that you hast done well, to do that which is right in Mine eyes — according to all that is in My heart you hast done to the house of Ahab — the sons of the fourth generation do sit for thee on the throne of Israel.'
\v 31 And Jehu had not taken heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, God of Israel, with all his heart, he had not turned aside from the sins of Jeroboam, that he caused Israel to sin.
\v 32 In those days had Yahweh begun to cut off some in Israel, and Hazael smiteth them in all the border of Israel,
\v 33 from the Jordan, at the sun-rising, the whole land of Gilead, of the Gadite, and the Reubenite, and the Manassahite (from Aroer, that is by the brook Arnon), even Gilead and Bashan.
\v 34 And the rest of the matters of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 35 And Jehu lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in Samaria, and reign did Jehoahaz his son in his stead.
\v 36 And the days that Jehu had reigned over Israel are twenty and eight years, in Samaria.
\c 11
\v 1 And Athaliah is mother of Ahaziah, and she had seen that her son is dead, and she riseth, and destroyeth all the seed of the kingdom;
\v 2 and Jehosheba daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, taketh Joash son of Ahaziah, and stealeth him out of the middle of the sons of the king who are put to death, him and his nurse, in the inner part of the bed-chambers, and they hide him from the presence of Athaliah, and he had not been put to death,
\v 3 and he is with her, in the house of Yahweh, hiding himself, six years, and Athaliah is reigning over the land.
\v 4 And in the seventh year had Jehoiada sent and taketh the heads of the hundreds, of the executioners and of the runners, and brought them in unto him, to the house of Yahweh, and made with them a covenant, and caused them to swear in the house of Yahweh, and sheweth them the son of the king,
\v 5 and commandeth them, saying, 'This is the thing that ye do; The third of you are going in on the sabbath, and keepers of the charge of the house of the king,
\v 6 and the third is at the gate of Sur, and the third at the gate behind the runners, and ye have kept the charge of the house pulled down;
\v 7 and two parts of you, all going out on the sabbath — they have kept the charge of the house of Yahweh about the king,
\v 8 and ye have compassed the king round about, each with his weapons in his hand, and he who is coming unto the ranges is put to death; and be ye with the king in his going out and in his coming in.'
\v 9 And the heads of the hundreds do according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and take each his men going in on the sabbath, with those going out on the sabbath, and come in unto Jehoiada the priest,
\v 10 and the priest gave to the heads of the hundreds the spears and the shields that king David had, that are in the house of Yahweh.
\v 11 And the runners stand, each with his weapons in his hand, from the right shoulder of the house unto the left shoulder of the house, by the altar and by the house, by the king round about;
\v 12 and he brought out the son of the king, and putteth on him the crown, and the testimony, and they make him king, and anoint him, and smite the hand, and say, 'Let the king live.'
\v 13 And Athaliah heareth the voice of the runners and of the people, and she came in unto the people, to the house of Yahweh,
\v 14 and looketh, and lo, the king is standing by the pillar, according to the ordinance, and the heads, and the trumpets, are by the king, and all the people of the land are rejoicing, and blowing with trumpets, and Athaliah rendeth her garments, and called, 'Conspiracy! conspiracy!'
\v 15 And Jehoiada the priest commandeth the heads of the hundreds, inspectors of the force, and said unto them, 'Bring her out unto the outside of the ranges, and him who is going after her, put to death by the sword:' for the priest had said, 'Let her not be put to death in the house of Yahweh.'
\v 16 And they make for her sides, and she entereth the way of the entering in of the horses to the house of the king, and is put to death there.
\v 17 And Jehoiada made the covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, to be for a people to Yahweh, and between the king and the people.
\v 18 And all the people of the land go in to the house of Baal, and break it down, its altars and its images they have thoroughly broken, and Mattan priest of Baal they have killed before the altars; and the priest setteth inspectors over the house of Yahweh,
\v 19 and taketh the heads of the hundreds, and the executioners, and the runners, and all the people of the land, and they bring down the king from the house of Yahweh, and come by the way of the gate of the runners, to the house of the king, and he sitteth on the throne of the kings.
\v 20 And all the people of the land rejoice, and the city is quiet, and Athaliah they have put to death by the sword in the house of the king;
\v 21 a son of seven years is Jehoash in his reigning.
\c 12
\v 1 In the seventh year of Jehu reigned had Jehoash, and forty years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Zibiah of Beer-Sheba,
\v 2 and Jehoash did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest directed him,
\v 3 only, the high places have not turned aside, still are the people sacrificing and making perfume in high places.
\v 4 And Jehoash said unto the priests, 'All the money of the sanctified things that is brought in to the house of Yahweh, the money of him who is passing over, each the money of his valuation, all the money that it went up on the heart of a man to bring in to the house of Yahweh,
\v 5 do the priests take to them, each from his acquaintance, and they strengthen the breach of the house, in all places where there is found a breach.'
\v 6 And it came to pass, in the twenty and third year of king Jehoash, the priests have not strengthened the breach of the house,
\v 7 and king Jehoash called to Jehoiada the priest, and to the priests, and said unto them, 'Wherefore are ye not strengthening the breach of the house? and now, receive no money from your acquaintances, but for the breach of the house give it.'
\v 8 And the priests consent not to receive money from the people, nor to strengthen the breach of the house,
\v 9 and Jehoiada the priest taketh a chest, and pierceth a hole in its lid, and putteth it near the altar, on the right side, as one came in to the house of Yahweh, and the priests keeping the threshold have put there all the money that is brought in to the house of Yahweh.
\v 10 And it came to pass, at their seeing that the money is abundant in the chest, that there went up a scribe of the king, and of the high priest, and they bind it up, and count the money that is found in the house of Yahweh,
\v 11 and have given the weighed money into the hands of those doing the work, those inspecting the house of Yahweh, and they bring it out to those working in the wood, and to builders who are working in the house of Yahweh,
\v 12 and to those repairing the wall, and to hewers of stone, and to buy wood and hewn stones to strengthen the breach of the house of Yahweh, and for all that went out on the house, to strengthen it.
\v 13 Only, there is not made for the house of Yahweh basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any vessel of gold, and vessel of silver, out of the money that is brought into the house of Yahweh;
\v 14 for to those doing the work they give it, and they have strengthened with it the house of Yahweh,
\v 15 and they do not reckon with the men into whose hand they give the money to give to those doing the work, for in faithfulness they are dealing.
\v 16 The money of a trespass-offering, and the money of sin-offerings is not brought in to the house of Yahweh — for the priests it is.
\v 17 Then go up did Hazael king of Aram, and fighteth against Gath, and captureth it, and Hazael setteth his face to go up against Jerusalem;
\v 18 and Jehoash king of Judah taketh all the sanctified things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had sanctified, and his own sanctified things, and all the gold that is found in the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the house of the king, and sent to Hazael king of Aram, and he went up from off Jerusalem.
\v 19 And the rest of the matters of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 20 And his servants rise, and make a conspiracy, and smite Joash in the house of Millo, that is going down to Silla:
\v 21 yea, Jozachar son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad son of Shemer, his servants, have smitten him, and he dieth, and they bury him with his fathers in the city of David, and reign did Amaziah his son, in his stead.
\c 13
\v 1 In the twenty and third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, had Jehoahaz son of Jehu reigned over Israel, in Samaria — seventeen years,
\v 2 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and went after the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, that he caused Israel to sin — he turned not aside from it,
\v 3 and the anger of Yahweh burneth against Israel, and He gave them into the hand of Hazael king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael, all the days.
\v 4 And Jehoahaz appeaseth the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh hearkeneth unto him, for He had seen the oppression of Israel, for oppressed them had the king of Aram, — 
\v 5 and Yahweh gave to Israel a saviour, and they go out from under the hand of Aram, and the sons of Israel dwell in their tents as heretofore;
\v 6 only, they have not turned aside from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, that he caused Israel to sin, therein they walked, and also, the shrine had remained in Samaria, — 
\v 7 for he left not to Jehoahaz of the people except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten yousand footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them, and made them as dust for threshing.
\v 8 And the rest of the matters of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\v 14 And Elisha had been sick with his sickness in which he dieth, and come down unto him did Joash king of Israel, and weepeth on his face, and said, 'My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen.'
\v 15 And Elisha said to him, 'Take bow and arrows:' and he taketh unto him bow and arrows.
\v 16 And he said to the king of Israel, 'Place your hand on the bow;' and he placeth his hand, and Elisha putteth his hands on the hands of the king,
\v 17 and said, 'Open the window eastward;' and he opened, and Elisha said, 'Shoot,' and he shooteth; and he said, 'An arrow of salvation to Yahweh, and an arrow of salvation against Aram, and you hast smitten Aram, in Aphek, till consuming.'
\v 18 And he said, 'Take the arrows,' and he taketh; and he said to the king of Israel, 'Smite to the earth;' and he smiteth three times, and stayeth.
\v 19 And the man of God is wroth against him, and said, 'By smiting five or six times then you hadst smitten Aram till consuming; and now, three times you will smite Aram.'
\v 20 And Elisha dieth, and they bury him, and troops of Moab come in to the land, at the coming in of the year,
\v 21 and it came to pass, they are burying a man, and lo, they have seen the troop, and cast the man into the grave of Elisha, and the man went and came against the bones of Elisha, and lived, and riseth on his feet.
\v 22 And Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz,
\v 23 and Yahweh did favour them, and pity them, and turn unto them, for the sake of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and had not been willing to destroy them, nor to cast them from His presence as yet.
\v 24 And Hazael king of Aram dieth, and reign did Ben-Hadad his son in his stead,
\v 25 and Jehoash son of Jehoahaz turneth and taketh the cities out of the hand of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael that he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father in war; three times had Joash smitten him, and he brought back the cities of Israel.
\c 14

\v 2 a son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and twenty and nine years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jehoaddan of Jerusalem,
\v 3 and he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not like David his father, according to all that Joash his father did he had done,
\v 4 only, the high places have not turned aside — yet are the people sacrificing and making perfume in high places.
\v 5 And it came to pass, when the kingdom had been strong in his hand, that he smiteth his servants, those smiting the king his father,
\v 6 and the sons of those smiting him he had not put to death, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses that Yahweh commanded, saying, 'Fathers are not put to death for sons, and sons are not put to death for fathers, but each for his own sin is put to death.'
\v 7 He had smitten Edom, in the valley of salt — ten yousand, and seized Selah in war, and one called its name Joktheel unto this day,
\v 8 then had Amaziah sent messengers unto Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, 'Come, we look one another in the face.'
\v 9 And Jehoash king of Israel sent unto Amaziah king of Judah, saying, 'The thorn that is in Lebanon had sent unto the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son for a wife; and pass by did a beast of the field that is in Lebanon, and treadeth down the thorn.
\v 10 Thou hast certainly smitten Edom, and your heart had lifted thee up; be honoured, and abide in your house; and why will you stir yourself up in evil, that you hast fallen, you, and Judah with thee?'
\v 11 And Amaziah had not hearkened, and go up did Jehoash king of Israel, and they look one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in Beth-Shemesh, that is Judah's,
\v 12 and Judah is smitten before Israel, and they flee each to his tent.

\v 26 for Yahweh had seen the affliction of Israel — very bitter, and there is none restrained, and there is none left, and there is no helper to Israel;
\v 27 and Yahweh had not spoken to blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens, and saveth them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Joash.

\v 36 And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?

\v 38 And Jotham lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers, in the city of David his father, and reign did Ahaz his son in his stead.
\c 16
\v 1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah reigned had Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah.
\v 2 A son of twenty years is Ahaz in his reigning, and sixteen years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and he had not done that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh his God, like David his father,
\v 3 and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, and also his son he had caused to pass over into fire, according to the abominations of the nations that Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,
\v 4 and he sacrificeth and made perfume in high places, and on the heights, and under every green tree.
\v 5 Then did Rezin king of Aram go up, and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to battle, and they lay siege to Ahaz, and they have not been able to fight.
\v 6 At that time had Rezin king of Aram brought back Elath to Aram, and threw out the Jews from Elath, and the Aramaeans have come in to Elath, and dwell there unto this day.
\v 7 And Ahaz sent messengers unto Tiglath-Pileser king of Asshur, saying, 'Your servant and your son am I; come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.'
\v 8 And Ahaz taketh the silver and the gold that is found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the house of the king, and sent to the king of Asshur — a bribe.
\v 9 And hearken unto him did the king of Asshur, and the king of Asshur went up unto Damascus, and seizeth it, and removeth the people of it to Kir, and Rezin he had put to death.
\v 10 And king Ahaz went to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Asshur at Damascus, and saw the altar that is in Damascus, and king Ahaz sent unto Urijah the priest the likeness of the altar, and its pattern, according to all its work,
\v 11 and Urijah the priest built the altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus; so did Urijah the priest till the coming in of king Ahaz from Damascus.
\v 12 And the king came in from Damascus, and the king saw the altar, and the king draweth near on the altar, and offereth on it,
\v 13 and perfumeth his burnt-offering, and his present, and poureth out his libation, and sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings that he had, on the altar.
\v 14 As to the altar of brass that is before Yahweh — he brought it near from the front of the house, from between the altar and the house of Yahweh, and putteth it on the side of the altar, northward.
\v 15 And king Ahaz commandeth him — Urijah the priest — saying, 'On the great altar perfume the burnt-offering of the morning, and the present of the evening, and the burnt-offering of the king, and his present, and the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their present, and their libations; and all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice, on it you will sprinkle, and the altar of brass is to me to inquire by.'
\v 16 And Urijah the priest did according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
\v 17 And king Ahaz cutteth off the borders of the bases, and turneth aside from off them the laver, and the sea he had taken down from off the brazen oxen that are under it, and putteth it on a pavement of stones.
\v 18 And the covered place for the sabbath that they built in the house, and the entrance of the king wiyout, he turned from the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Asshur.
\v 19 And the rest of the matters of Ahaz that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 20 And Ahaz lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers, in the city of David, and reign did Hezekiah his son in his stead.
\c 17
\v 1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah reigned had Hoshea son of Elah in Samaria, over Israel — nine years,
\v 2 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, only, not as the kings of Israel who were before him;
\v 3 against him came up Shalmaneser king of Asshur, and Hoshea is to him a servant, and did render to him a present.
\v 4 And the king of Asshur findeth in Hoshea a conspiracy, in that he had sent messengers unto So king of Egypt, and had not caused a present to go up to the king of Asshur, as year by year, and the king of Asshur restraineth him, and bindeth him in a house of restraint.
\v 5 And the king of Asshur went up into all the land, and he went up to Samaria, and laid siege against it three years;
\v 6 in the ninth year of Hoshea had the king of Asshur captured Samaria, and removeth Israel to Asshur, and caused them to dwell in Halah, and in Habor, by the river Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\v 7 And it came to pass, because the sons of Israel have sinned against Yahweh their God — who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt — and fear other gods,
\v 8 and walk in the statutes of the nations that Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel, and of the kings of Israel that they made;
\v 9 and the sons of Israel do covertly things that are not right against Yahweh their God, and build for them high places in all their cities, from a tower of the watchers unto the fenced city,
\v 10 and set up for them standing-pillars and shrines on every high height, and under every green tree,
\v 11 and make perfume there in all high places, like the nations that Yahweh removed from their presence, and do evil things to provoke Yahweh,
\v 12 and serve the idols, of which Yahweh said to them, 'Ye do not do this thing;'
\v 13 And Yahweh testifieth against Israel, and against Judah, by the hand of every prophet, and every seer, saying, 'Turn back from your evil ways, and keep My commands, My statutes, according to all the law that I commanded your fathers, and that I sent unto you by the hand of My servants the prophets;'
\v 14 and they have not hearkened, and harden their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who did not remain stedfast in Yahweh their God,
\v 15 and reject His statutes and His covenant that He made with their fathers, and His testimonies that He testified against them, and go after the vain thing, and become vain, and after the nations that are round about them, of whom Yahweh commanded them not to do like them;
\v 16 And they forsake all the commands of Yahweh their God, and make to them a molten image — two calves, and make a shrine, and bow themselves to all the host of the heavens, and serve Baal,
\v 17 and cause their sons and their daughters to pass over through fire, and divine divinations, and use enchantments, and sell themselves to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, to provoke Him;
\v 18 That Yahweh sheweth himself very angry against Israel, and turneth them aside from His presence; none had been left, only the tribe of Judah by itself.
\v 19 Also Judah had not kept the commands of Yahweh their God, and they walk in the statutes of Israel that they had made.
\v 20 And Yahweh kicketh against all the seed of Israel, and afflicteth them, and gave them into the hand of spoilers, till that He had cast them out of His presence,
\v 21 for He had rent Israel from the house of David, and they make Jeroboam son of Nebat king, and Jeroboam driveth Israel from after Yahweh, and had caused them to sin a great sin,
\v 22 and the sons of Israel walk in all the sins of Jeroboam that he did, they have not turned aside therefrom,
\v 23 till that Yahweh had turned Israel aside from His presence, as He spake by the hand of all His servants the prophets, and Israel is removed from off its land to Asshur, unto this day.
\v 24 And the king of Asshur brought in from Babylon and from Cutha, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and caused them to dwell in the cities of Samaria instead of the sons of Israel, and they possess Samaria, and dwell in its cities;
\v 25 and it came to pass, at the commencement of their dwelling there, they have not feared Yahweh, and Yahweh did send among them the lions, and they are destroying among them.
\v 26 And they speak to the king of Asshur, saying, 'The nations that you hast removed, and will place in the cities of Samaria, have not known the custom of the God of the land, and He sent among them the lions, and lo, they are destroying them, as they do not know the custom of the God of the land.'
\v 27 And the king of Asshur commandeth, saying, 'Cause to go thither one of the priests whom ye removed there, and they go and dwell there, and he did teach them the custom of the God of the land.'
\v 28 And one of the priests whom they removed from Samaria came in, and dwelleth in Beth-El, and he is teaching them how they do fear Yahweh,
\v 29 and they are making each nation its gods, and place them in the houses of the high places that the Samaritans have made, each nation in their cities where they are dwelling.
\v 30 And the men of Babylon have made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth have made Nergal, and the men of Hamath have made Ashima,
\v 31 and the Avites have made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites are burning their sons with fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, gods of Sepharvim.
\v 32 And they are fearing Yahweh, and make to themselves from their extremities priests of high places, and they are acting for them in the house of the high places.
\v 33 Yahweh they are fearing, and their gods they are serving, according to the custom of the nations whence they removed them.
\v 34 Unto this day they are doing according to the former customs — they are not fearing Yahweh, and are not doing according to their statutes, and according to their ordinances, and according to the law, and according to the command, that Yahweh commanded the sons of Jacob whose name He made Israel,
\v 35 and Yahweh made with them a covenant, and chargeth them, saying, 'Ye do not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them,
\v 36 but Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a stretched-out arm, Him ye do fear, and to Him ye bow yourselves, and to Him ye do sacrifice;
\v 37 and the statutes, and the judgments, and the law, and the command, that He wrote for you, ye observe to do all the days, and ye do not fear other gods;
\v 38 and the covenant that I have made with you ye do not forget, and ye do not fear other gods;
\v 39 but Yahweh your God ye do fear, and He did deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies;'
\v 40 and they have not hearkened, but according to their former custom they are doing,
\v 41 and these nations are fearing Yahweh, and their graven images they have served, both their sons and their sons' sons; as their fathers did, they are doing unto this day.
\c 18
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, reigned had Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah;
\v 2 a son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and twenty and nine years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Abi daughter of Zechariah.
\v 3 And he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father did,
\v 4 he had turned aside the high places, and broken in pieces the standing-pillars, and cut down the shrine, and beaten down the brazen serpent that Moses made, for unto these days were the sons of Israel making perfume to it, and he called it 'a piece of brass.'
\v 5 In Yahweh, God of Israel, he had trusted, and after him there had not been like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among any who were before him;
\v 6 and he cleaveth to Yahweh, he had not turned aside from after Him, and keepeth His commands that Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 7 And Yahweh had been with him, in every place where he went out he acteth wisely, and he rebelleth against the king of Asshur, and had not served him;
\v 8 he had smitten the Philistines unto Gaza, and its borders, from a tower of watchers unto the fenced city.
\v 9 And it came to pass, in the fourth year of king Hezekiah — it is the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel — come up had Shalmaneser king of Asshur against Samaria, and laid siege to it,
\v 10 and they capture it at the end of three years; in the sixth year of Hezekiah — it is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel — had Samaria been captureth,
\v 11 and the king of Asshur removeth Israel to Asshur, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor by the river Gozan, and in cities of the Medes,
\v 12 because that they have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh their God, and transgress His covenant — all that He commanded Moses, servant of Yahweh — yea, they have not hearkened nor done it.
\v 13 And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah had Sennacherib king of Asshur come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and seizeth them,
\v 14 and Hezekiah king of Judah sent unto the king of Asshur to Lachish, saying, 'I have sinned, turn back from off me; that which you puttest on me I bear;' and the king of Asshur laid on Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold,
\v 15 and Hezekiah gave all the silver that is found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the house of the king;
\v 16 at that time had Hezekiah cut off the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and the pillars that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave them to the king of Asshur.
\v 17 And the king of Asshur sent Tartan, and the chief of the eunuchs, and the chief of the butlers, from Lachish, unto king Hezekiah, with a heavy force, to Jerusalem, and they go up and come in to Jerusalem, and they go up, and come in and stand by the conduit of the upper pool that is in the highway of the fuller's field.
\v 18 And they call unto the king, and go out unto them did Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who is over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the remembrancer.
\v 19 And the chief of the butlers said unto them, 'Say, I pray you, unto Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Asshur, What is this confidence in which you hast confided?
\v 20 Thou hast said: Only a word of the lips! counsel and might are for battle; now, on whom hast you trusted that you hast rebelled against me?
\v 21 Now, lo, you hast trusted for thee on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; which a man leaneth on, and it had gone into his hand, and pierced it! — so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all those trusting on him.
\v 22 'And when ye say unto me, Unto Yahweh our God we have trusted, is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah had turned aside, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar do ye bow yourselves in Jerusalem?
\v 23 'And, now, give a pledge for thee, I pray thee, to my lord the king of Asshur, and I give to thee two yousand horses, if you art able to give for thee riders on them.
\v 24 And how will you turn back the face of one captain of the least of the servants of my lord, that you will trust for thee on Egypt for chariot, and for horsemen?
\v 25 Now, wiyout Yahweh have I come up against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said unto me, Go up against this land, and you hast destroyed it.'
\v 26 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah said — and Shebna, and Joah — to the chief of the butlers, 'Speak, we pray thee, unto your servants in Aramaean, for we are understanding, and do not speak with us in Jewish, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.'
\v 27 And the chief of the butlers said unto them, 'For your lord, and unto thee, had my lord sent me to speak these words? is it not for the men, those sitting on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water, with you?'
\v 28 And the chief of the butlers standeth and called with a great voice in Jewish, and spoke and said, 'Hear ye a word of the great king, the king of Asshur:
\v 29 thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah lift you up, for he is not able to deliver you out of his hand;
\v 30 and let not Hezekiah make you trust unto Yahweh, saying, Yahweh did certainly deliver us, and this city is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.
\v 31 'Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for thus said the king of Asshur, Make with me a blessing, and come out unto me, and eat ye each of his vine, and each of his fig-tree, and drink ye each the waters of his own well,
\v 32 till my coming in, and I have taken you unto a land like your own land, a land of corn and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive, and honey, and live, and die not; and do not hearken unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Yahweh did deliver us.
\v 33 'Have the gods of the nations delivered at all each his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur?
\v 34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah, that they have delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\v 35 Who are they among all the gods of the lands that have delivered their land out of my hand, that Yahweh did deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'
\v 36 And the people have kept silent, and have not answered him a word, for the command of the king is, saying, 'Do not answer him.'
\v 37 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who is over the house, came in, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the remembrancer, unto Hezekiah, with rent garments, and they declare to him the words of the chief of the butlers.
\c 19
\v 1 And it came to pass, at king Hezekiah's hearing, that he rendeth his garments, and covereth himself with sackcloth, and entereth the house of Yahweh,
\v 2 and sent Eliakim, who is over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covering themselves with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz,
\v 3 and they say unto him, 'Thus said Hezekiah — A day of distress, and rebuke, and despising is this day; for come have sons unto the birth, and power there is not to bring forth.
\v 4 'It may be Yahweh your God did hear all the words of the chief of the butlers with which the king of Asshur his lord had sent him to reproach the living God, and had decided concerning the words that Yahweh your God had heard, and you hast lifted up prayer for the remnant that is found.'
\v 5 And the servants of king Hezekiah come in unto Isaiah,
\v 6 and Isaiah said to them, 'Thus do ye say unto your lord: Thus said Yahweh, Be not afraid because of the words that you hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have reviled Me.
\v 7 Lo, I am giving in him a spirit, and he had heard a report, and had turned back to his land, and I have caused him to fall by the sword in his land.'
\v 8 And the chief of the butlers turneth back and findeth the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had journeyed from Lachish.
\v 9 And he heareth concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, 'Lo, he had come out to fight with thee;' and he turneth and sent messengers unto Hezekiah, saying,
\v 10 'Thus do ye speak unto Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God lift thee up in whom you art trusting, saying, Jerusalem is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.
\v 11 Lo, you hast heard that which the kings of Asshur have done to all the lands — to devote them; and you art delivered!
\v 12 did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed — Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who are in Thelassar?
\v 13 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'
\v 14 And Hezekiah taketh the letters out of the hand of the messengers, and readeth them, and went up to the house of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spreadeth it before Yahweh.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayeth before Yahweh, and said, 'O Yahweh, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubs, Thou art God Himself — Yourself alone — to all the kingdoms of the earth: Thou hast made the heavens and the earth.
\v 16 Incline, O Yahweh, Thine ear, and hear; open, O Yahweh, Thine eyes, and see; and hear Thou the words of Sennacherib with which he had sent him to reproach the living God.
\v 17 'Truly, O Yahweh, kings of Asshur have laid waste the nations, and their land,
\v 18 and have put their gods into fire, for they are no gods, but work of the hands of man, wood and stone, and destroy them.
\v 19 And now, O Yahweh our God, save us, we pray Thee, out of his hand, and know do all kingdoms of the earth that Thou art Yahweh God — Yourself alone.'
\v 20 And Isaiah son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, That which you hast prayed unto Me concerning Sennacherib king of Asshur I have heard:
\v 21 this is the word that Yahweh spake concerning him: 'Trampled on thee — laughed at thee, Hath the virgin daughter of Zion Behind thee shaken the head — Hath the daughter of Jerusalem?
\v 22 Whom hast you reproached and reviled? And against whom lifted up a voice? Yea, you will lift up on high yours eyes — Against the Holy One of Israel!
\v 23 By the hand of your messengers Thou hast reproached the Lord, and sayest: In the multitude of my chariots I have come up to a high place of mountains — The sides of Lebanon, And I cut down the height of its cedars, The choice of its firs, And I enter the lodging of its extremity, The forest of its Carmel.
\v 24 I have digged, and drunk strange waters, And I dry up with the sole of my steps All floods of a bulwark.
\v 25 Hast you not heard from afar, it I made, From days of old that I formed it? Now I have brought it in, And it became a desolation, Ruinous heaps are fenced cities,
\v 26 And their inhabitants are feeble-handed, They were broken down, and are dried up, They have been the herb of the field, And the greenness of the tender grass, Grass of the roofs, And blasted corn — before it had risen up!
\v 27 And your sitting down, and your going out, And your coming in, I have known, And yours anger towards Me;
\v 28 Because of yours anger towards Me, And your noise — it came up into Mine ears, I have put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And have caused thee to turn back, In the way in which you camest.
\v 29 And this to thee is the sign, Food of the year is the spontaneous growth, And in the second year the self-produced, And in the third year sow ye, and reap, And plant vineyards, and eat their fruits.
\v 30 And it had continued — The escaped of the house of Judah That had been left — to take root beneath, And had made fruit upward.
\v 31 For from Jerusalem went out a remnant, And an escape from mount Zion; The zeal of Yahweh of Hosts did this.
\v 32 Therefore, thus said Yahweh, Concerning the king of Asshur: He did not come in unto this city, Nor did he shoot there an arrow, Nor did he come before it with shield. Nor did he pour out against it a mount.
\v 33 In the way that he came in — In it he turneth back, And unto this city he did not come in, The affirmation of Yahweh — 
\v 34 And I have covered over this city, To save it, for Mine own sake, And for the sake of David My servant.'
\v 35 And it came to pass, in that night, that a messenger of Yahweh went out, and smiteth in the camp of Asshur a hundred eighty and five yousand, and they rise early in the morning, and lo, all of them are dead corpses.
\v 36 And Sennacherib king of Asshur journeyeth, and went, and turneth back, and dwelleth in Nineveh;
\v 37 and it came to pass, he is bowing himself in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech and Sharezar his sons have smitten him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land of Ararat, and Esar-Haddon his son reigneth in his stead.
\c 20
\v 1 In those days had Hezekiah been sick unto death, and come unto him did Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, and said unto him, 'Thus said Yahweh: Give a charge to your house, for you art dying, and will not live.'
\v 2 And he turneth round his face unto the wall, and prayeth unto Yahweh, saying,
\v 3 I pray Thee, O Yahweh, remember, I pray Thee, how I have walked habitually before Thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and that which is good in Thine eyes I have done;' and Hezekiah weepeth — a great weeping.
\v 4 And it came to pass — Isaiah had not gone out to the middle court — that the word of Yahweh had been unto him, saying,
\v 5 'Turn back, and you hast said unto Hezekiah, leader of My people: Thus said Yahweh, God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tear, lo, I give healing to thee, on the third day you will go up to the house of Yahweh;
\v 6 and I have added to your days fifteen years, and out of the hand of the king of Asshur I deliver thee and this city, and have covered over this city for Mine own sake, and for the sake of David My servant.'
\v 7 And Isaiah said, 'Take ye a cake of figs;' and they take and lay it on the boil, and he reviveth.
\v 8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, 'What is the sign that Yahweh did give healing to me, that I have gone up on the third day to the house of Yahweh?'
\v 9 And Isaiah said, 'This is to thee the sign from Yahweh, that Yahweh did the thing that He had spoken — The shadow had gone on ten degrees, or it did turn back ten degrees?'
\v 10 And Hezekiah said, 'It had been light for the shadow to incline ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow turn backward ten degrees.'
\v 11 And Isaiah the prophet called unto Yahweh, and He brought back the shadow by the degrees that it had gone down in the degrees of Ahaz — backward ten degrees.
\v 12 At that time had Berodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick;
\v 13 and Hezekiah hearkeneth unto them, and sheweth them all the house of his treasury, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good ointment, and all the house of his vessels, and all that had been found in his treasuries; there had not been a thing that Hezekiah had not shewed them, in his house, and in all his dominion.
\v 14 And Isaiah the prophet came in unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, 'What said these men? and whence come they unto thee?' And Hezekiah said, 'From a land afar off they have come — from Babylon.'
\v 15 And he said, 'What saw they in your house?' and Hezekiah said, 'All that is in my house they saw; there had not been a thing that I have not shewed them among my treasures.'
\v 16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, 'Hear a word of Yahweh:
\v 17 Lo, days are coming, and borne had been all that is in your house, and that your father have treasured up till this day, to Babylon; there is not left a thing, said Yahweh;
\v 18 and of your sons who go out from thee, whom you begettest, they take away, and they have been eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'
\v 19 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, 'Good is the word of Yahweh that you hast spoken;' and he said, 'Is it not — if peace and truth are in my days?'
\v 20 And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought in the waters to the city, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 21 And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and reign did Manasseh his son in his stead.
\c 21
\v 1 A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Hephzi-Bah;
\v 2 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, according to the abominations of the nations that Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,
\v 3 and he turneth and built the high places that Hezekiah his father destroyed, and raiseth altars for Baal, and made a shrine, as did Ahab king of Israel, and boweth himself to all the host of the heavens, and serveth them.
\v 4 And he had built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, 'In Jerusalem I put My name.'
\v 5 And he built altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Yahweh;
\v 6 and he had caused his son to pass through fire, and observed clouds, and used enchantment, and dealt with a familiar spirit and wizards; he had multiplied to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh — to provoke to anger.
\v 7 And he setteth the graven image of the shrine that he made in the house of which Yahweh said unto David and unto Solomon his son, 'In this house, and in Jerusalem, that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name — to the age;
\v 8 and I do not add to cause the foot of Israel to move from the ground that I gave to their fathers, only, if they observe to do according to all that I commanded them, and to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.'
\v 9 And they have not hearkened, and Manasseh caused them to err, to do the evil thing above the nations that Yahweh destroyed from the presence of the sons of Israel.
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,
\v 11 Because that Manasseh king of Judah had done these abominations — he had done evil above all that the Amorites have done who are before him, and caused also Judah to sin by his idols;
\v 12 therefore thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Lo, I am bringing in evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever heareth of it, tingle do his two ears.
\v 13 And I have stretched out over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and wiped Jerusalem as one wipeth the dish — he had wiped, and had turned it on its face.
\v 14 'And I have left the remnant of Mine inheritance, and given them into the hand of their enemies, and they have been for a prey and for a spoil to all their enemies,
\v 15 because that they have done the evil thing in Mine eyes, and are provoking Me to anger from the day that their fathers came out of Egypt, even unto this day.'
\v 16 And also, innocent blood had Manasseh shed very much, till that he had filled Jerusalem — mouth to mouth; apart from his sin that he had caused Judah to sin, to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 17 And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 18 And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza, and reign did Amon his son in his stead.
\v 19 A son of twenty and two years is Amon in his reigning, and two years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz of Jotbah,
\v 20 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father,
\v 21 and walketh in all the way that his father walked in, and serveth the idols that his father served, and boweth himself to them,
\v 22 and forsaketh Yahweh, God of his fathers, and had not walked in the way of Yahweh.
\v 23 And the servants of Amon conspire against him, and put the king to death in his own house,
\v 24 and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his son to reign in his stead.
\v 25 And the rest of the matters of Amon that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 26 and one burieth him in his burying-place in the garden of Uzza, and reign did Josiah his son in his stead.
\c 22
\v 1 A son of eight years is Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Boskath,
\v 2 and he did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walketh in all the way of David his father, and had not turned aside — right or left.
\v 3 And it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king had sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,
\v 4 'Go up unto Hilkiah the high priest, and he did complete the silver that is brought into the house of Yahweh, that the keepers of the threshold have gathered from the people,
\v 5 and they give it into the hand of the doers of the work, the overseers, in the house of Yahweh, and they give it to the doers of the work that is in the house of Yahweh, to strengthen the breach of the house,
\v 6 to artificers, and to builders, and to repairers of the wall, and to buy wood and hewn stones to strengthen the house;
\v 7 only, the silver that is given into their hand is not reckoned with them, for in faithfulness they are dealing.
\v 8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, 'A book of the law I have found in the house of Yahweh;' and Hilkiah gave the book unto Shaphan, and he readeth it.
\v 9 And Shaphan the scribe came in unto the king, and brought the king back word, and said, 'Your servants have poured out the silver that had been found in the house, and give it into the hand of the doers of the work, the inspectors, in the house of Yahweh.'
\v 10 And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, 'A book had Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth it before the king.
\v 11 And it came to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the book of the law, that he rendeth his garments,
\v 12 and the king commandeth Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Achbor son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah servant of the king, saying,
\v 13 Go, seek Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found, for great is the fury of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because that our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according to all that is written for us.'
\v 14 And Hilkiah the priest went, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the garments, and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the second, and they speak unto her.
\v 15 And she said unto them, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Say to the man who had sent you unto me:
\v 16 Thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am bringing in evil unto this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah had read,
\v 17 because that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, so as to provoke Me to anger with every work of their hands, and My wrath had been kindled against this place, and it is not quenched.
\v 18 And unto the king of Judah, who is sending you to seek Yahweh, thus do ye say unto him, Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, The words that you hast heard — 
\v 19 because your heart is tender, and you art humbled because of Yahweh, in your hearing that which I have spoken against this place, and against its inhabitants, to be for a desolation, and for a reviling, and will rend your garments, and weep before Me — I also have heard — the affirmation of Yahweh — 
\v 20 therefore, lo, I am gathering thee unto your fathers, and you hast been gathered unto your grave in peace, and yours eyes do not look on any of the evil that I am bringing in on this place;' and they bring the king back word.
\c 23
\v 1 And the king sent, and they gather unto him all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem,
\v 2 and the king went up to the house of Yahweh, and every man of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, from small unto great, and he readeth in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that is found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 And the king standeth by the pillar, and made the covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep His commands, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all the heart, and with all the soul, to establish the words of this covenant that are written on this book, and all the people stand in the covenant.
\v 4 And the king commandeth Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out from the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that are made for Baal, and for the shrine, and for all the host of the heavens, and he burneth them at the outside of Jerusalem, in the fields of Kidron, and had borne their ashes to Beth-El.
\v 5 And he had caused to cease the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah have appointed, (and they make perfume in high places, in cities of Judah and suburbs of Jerusalem,) and those making perfume to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of the heavens.
\v 6 And he brought out the shrine from the house of Yahweh to the outside of Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burneth it at the brook Kidron, and beateth it small to dust, and threw its dust on the grave of the sons of the people.
\v 7 And he breaketh down the houses of the whoremongers that are in the house of Yahweh, where the women are weaving houses for the shrine.
\v 8 And he brought in all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defileth the high places where the priests have made perfume, from Geba unto Beer-Sheba, and had broken down the high places of the gates that are at the opening of the gate of Joshua, head of the city, that is on a man's left hand at the gate of the city;
\v 9 only, the priests of the high places come not up unto the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they have eaten unleavened things in the middle of their brethren.
\v 10 And he had defiled Topheth, that is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, so that no man did cause his son and his daughter to pass over through fire to Molech.
\v 11 And he caused to cease the horses that the kings of Judah have given to the sun from the entering in of the house of Yahweh, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech the eunuch, that is in the suburbs, and the chariots of the sun he had burnt with fire.
\v 12 And the altars that are on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, that the kings of Judah made, and the altars that Manasseh made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, had the king broken down, and removeth there, and had cast their dust unto the brook Kidron.
\v 13 And the high places that are on the front of Jerusalem, that are on the right of the mount of corruption, that Solomon king of Israel had built to Ashtoreth abomination of the Zidonians, and Chemosh abomination of Moab, and to Milcom abomination of the sons of Ammon, had the king defiled.
\v 14 And he had broken in pieces the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the shrines, and filleth their place with bones of men;
\v 15 and also the altar that is in Beth-El, the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat made, by which he made Israel sin, both that altar and the high place he had broken down, and did burn the high place — he had beat it small to dust, and had burnt the shrine.
\v 16 And Josiah turneth, and saw the graves that are there in the mount, and sent and taketh the bones out of the graves, and burneth them on the altar, and defileth it, according to the word of Yahweh that the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
\v 17 And he said, 'What is this sign that I see?' and the men of the city say unto him, 'The grave of the man of God who had come from Judah, and proclaimeth these things that you hast done concerning the altar of Beth-El.'
\v 18 And he said, 'Let him alone, let no man touch his bones;' and they let his bones escape, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.
\v 19 And also all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria, that the kings of Israel made to provoke to anger, had Josiah turned aside, and did to them according to all the deeds that he did in Beth-El.
\v 20 And he slaid all the priests of the high places who are there by the altars, and burneth the bones of man upon them, and turneth back to Jerusalem.
\v 21 And the king commandeth the whole of the people, saying, 'Make ye a passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written on this book of the covenant.'
\v 22 Surely there had not been made like this passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Judah;
\v 23 but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, had this passover been made to Yahweh in Jerusalem.
\v 24 And also, those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah, and in Jerusalem, had Josiah put away, in order to establish the words of the law that are written on the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 25 And like him there had not been before him a king who turned back unto Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there had none risen like him.
\v 26 Only, Yahweh had not turned back from the fierceness of His great anger with which His anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh provoked him,
\v 27 and Yahweh said, 'Also Judah I turn aside from my presence, as I turned Israel aside, and I have rejected this city that I have chosen — Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name is there.'
\v 28 And the rest of the matters of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 29 In his days had Pharaoh-Nechoh king of Egypt come up against the king of Asshur, by the river Phrat, and king Josiah went out to meet him, and he putteth him to death in Megiddo, when he saw him.
\v 30 And his servants cause him to ride dying from Megiddo, and bring him in to Jerusalem, and bury him in his own grave, and the people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and anoint him, and cause him to reign instead of his father.
\v 31 A son of twenty and three years is Jehoahaz in his reigning, and three months he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah,
\v 32 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers did,
\v 33 and Pharaoh-Nechoh bindeth him in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, from reigning in Jerusalem, and he putteth a fine on the land — a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\v 34 And Pharaoh-Nechoh caused Eliakim son of Josiah to reign instead of Josiah his father, and turneth his name to Jehoiakim, and Jehoahaz he had taken away, and he came in to Egypt, and dieth there.
\v 35 And the silver and the gold had Jehoiakim given to Pharaoh; only he valued the land to give the silver by the command of Pharaoh; from each, according to his valuation, he exacted the silver and the gold, from the people of the land, to give to Pharaoh-Nechoh.
\v 36 A son of twenty and five years is Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Zebudah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah,
\v 37 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers did.
\c 24
\v 1 In his days had Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up, and Jehoiakim is to him a servant three years; and he turneth and rebelleth against him,
\v 2 and Yahweh sent against him the troops of the Chaldeans, and the troops of Aram, and the troops of Moab, and the troops of the sons of Ammon, and He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh, that He spake by the hand of His servants the prophets;
\v 3 only, by the command of Yahweh it had been against Judah to turn them aside from His presence, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,
\v 4 and also the innocent blood that he had shed, and he filleth Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Yahweh was not willing to forgive.
\v 5 And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 6 And Jehoiakim lieth with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 7 And the king of Egypt had not added any more to go out from his own land, for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Phrat, all that had been to the king of Egypt.
\v 8 A son of eighteen years is Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem,
\v 9 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers did.
\v 10 At that time come up have servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and the city went into siege,
\v 11 and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants are laying siege to it,
\v 12 and Jehoiachin king of Judah went out unto the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his chiefs, and his eunuchs, and the king of Babylon taketh him in the eighth year of his reign,
\v 13 and brought out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the house of the king, and cutteth in pieces all the vessels of gold that Solomon king of Israel made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 14 And he had removed all Jerusalem, and all the chiefs, and all the mighty ones of valour — ten yousand is the removal — and every artificer and smith, none had been left save the poor of the people of the land.
\v 15 And he removeth Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the mother of the king, and the wives of the king, and his eunuchs, and the mighty ones of the land — he had caused a removal to go from Jerusalem to Babylon,
\v 16 and all the men of valour seven yousand, and the artificers and the smiths a yousand, the whole are mighty men, warriors; and the king of Babylon brought them in a captivity to Babylon.
\v 17 And the king of Babylon caused Mattaniah his father's brother to reign in his stead, and turneth his name to Zedekiah.
\v 18 A son of twenty and one years is Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah,
\v 19 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that Jehoiakim did,
\v 20 for, by the anger of Yahweh it had been against Jerusalem and against Judah, till he cast them out from His presence, that Zedekiah rebelleth against the king of Babylon.
\c 25
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, come had Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, he and all his force, against Jerusalem, and encampeth against it, and built against it a fortification round about.
\v 2 And the city entereth into siege till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah,
\v 3 on the ninth of the month — when the famine is severe in the city, and there had not been bread for the people of the land,
\v 4 then the city is broken up, and all the men of war go by night the way of the gate, between the two walls that are by the garden of the king, and the Chaldeans are against the city round about, and the king went the way of the plain.
\v 5 And the force of the Chaldeans pursue after the king, and overtake him in the plains of Jericho, and all his force have been scattered from him;
\v 6 and they seize the king, and bring him up unto the king of Babylon, to Riblah, and they speak with him — judgment.
\v 7 And the sons of Zedekiah they have slaughtered before his eyes, and the eyes of Zedekiah he had blinded, and bindeth him with brazen fetters, and they bring him to Babylon.
\v 8 And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month (it is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), had Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners, servant of the king of Babylon, come to Jerusalem,
\v 9 and he burneth the house of Yahweh, and the house of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, yea, every great house he had burned with fire;
\v 10 and the walls of Jerusalem round about have all the forces of the Chaldeans, who are with the chief of the executioners, broken down.
\v 11 And the rest of the people, those left in the city, and those falling who have fallen to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude, had Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners removed;
\v 12 and of the poor of the land had the chief of the executioners left for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
\v 13 And the pillars of brass that are in the house of Yahweh, and the bases, and the sea of brass, that is in the house of Yahweh, have the Chaldeans broken in pieces, and bear away their brass to Babylon.
\v 14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they minister they have taken,
\v 15 and the fire-pans, and the bowls that are wholly of silver, had the chief of the executioners taken.
\v 16 The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases that Solomon made for the house of Yahweh, there was no weighing of the brass of all these vessels;
\v 17 eighteen cubits is the height of the one pillar, and the chapiter on it is of brass, and the height of the chapiter is three cubits, and the net and the pomegranates are on the chapiter round about — the whole is of brass; and like these had the second pillar, with the net.
\v 18 And the chief of the executioners taketh Seraiah the head priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold,
\v 19 and out of the city he had taken a certain eunuch who is appointed over the men of war, and five men of those seeing the king's face who have been found in the city, and the head scribe of the host, who mustereth the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who are found in the city,
\v 20 and Nebuzaradan chief of the executioners taketh them, and caused them to go unto the king of Babylon, to Libnah,
\v 21 and the king of Babylon smiteth them, and putteth them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he removeth Judah from off its land.
\v 22 And the people that is left in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left — he appointeth over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan.
\v 23 And all the heads of the forces hear — they and the men — that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, and they come in unto Gedaliah, to Mizpah, even Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophadite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maachadite — they and their men;
\v 24 and Gedaliah sweareth to them, and to their men, and said to them, 'Be not afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans, dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it is good for you.'
\v 25 And it came to pass, in the seventh month, come had Ishmael son of Nathaniah, son of Elishama of the seed of the kingdom, and ten men with him, and they smite Gedaliah, and he dieth, and the Jews and the Chaldeans who have been with him in Mizpah.
\v 26 And all the people rise, from small even unto great, and the heads of the forces, and come in to Egypt, for they have been afraid of the presence of the Chaldeans.
\v 27 And it came to pass, in the thirty and seventh year of the removal of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and seventh of the month had Evil-Merodach king of Babylon lifted up, in the year of his reigning, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, out of the house of restraint,
\v 28 and spoke with him good things and putteth his throne above the throne of the kings who are with him in Babylon,
\v 29 and had changed the garments of his restraint, and he had eaten bread continually before him all days of his life,
\v 30 and his allowance — a continual allowance — had been given to him from the king, the matter of a day in its day, all days of his life.
