\v 1 How had she sat alone, The city abounding with people! She had been as a widow, The mighty among nations! Princes among provinces, She had become tributary!
\v 2 She weepeth sore in the night, And her tear is on her cheeks, There is no comforter for her out of all her lovers, All her friends dealt treacherously by her, They have been to her for enemies.
\v 3 Removed had Judah because of affliction, And because of the abundance of her service; She had dwelt among nations, She had not found rest, All her pursuers have overtaken her between the straits.
\v 4 The ways of Zion are mourning, Without any coming at the appointed time, All her gates are desolate, her priests sigh, Her virgins are afflicted — and she had bitterness.
\v 5 Her adversaries have become chief, Her enemies have been at ease, For Yahweh had afflicted her, For the abundance of her transgressions, Her infants have gone captive before the adversary.
\v 6 And go out from the daughter of Zion did all her honour, Her princes have been as harts — They have not found pasture, And they go powerless before a pursuer.
\v 7 Remembered had Jerusalem In the days of her affliction and her mournings, all her desirable things that were from the days of old, In the falling of her people into the hand of an adversary, And she had no helper; Seen her have adversaries, They have laughed at her cessation.
\v 8 A sin had Jerusalem sinned, Therefore impure she had become, All who honoured her have esteemed her lightly, For they have seen her nakedness, Yea, she herself had sighed and turneth backward.
\v 9 Her uncleanness is in her skirts, She had not remembered her latter end, And she came down wonderfully, There is no comforter for her. See, O Yahweh, mine affliction, For exerted himself had an enemy.
\v 10 His hand spread out had an adversary On all her desirable things, For she had seen — Nations have entered her sanctuary, Concerning which You did command, 'They do not come into the assembly to you.'
\v 11 All her people are sighing — seeking bread, They have given their desirable things For food to refresh the body; See, O Yahweh, and behold attentively, For I have been lightly esteemed.
\v 12 Is it nothing to you, all you passing by the way? Look attentively, and see, If there is any pain like my pain, That He is rolling to me? Whom Yahweh had afflicted In the day of the fierceness of His anger.
\v 13 From above He had sent fire into my bone, And it subdueth it, He had spread a net for my feet, He had turned me backward, He had made me desolate — all the day sick.
\v 14 Bound had been the yoke of my transgressions by His hand, They are wrapped together, They have gone up on my neck, He had caused my power to stumble, The Lord had given me into hands, I am not able to rise.
\v 15 Trodden down all my mighty ones had the Lord in my middle, He proclaimed against me an appointed time, To destroy my young men, A wine-press had the Lord trodden, To the virgin daughter of Judah.
\v 16 For these I am weeping, My eye, my eye, is running down with waters, For, far from me had been a comforter, Refreshing my soul, My sons have been desolate, For mighty had been an enemy.
\v 17 Spread forth had Zion her hands, There is no comforter for her, Yahweh had charged concerning Jacob, His neighbours are his adversaries, Jerusalem had become impure among them.
\v 18 Righteous is Yahweh, For His mouth I have provoked. Hear, I pray you, all you peoples, and see my pain, My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.
\v 19 I called for my lovers, they — they have deceived me, My priests and my elders in the city have expired; When they have sought food for themselves, Then they give back their soul.
\v 20 See, O Yahweh, for distress is to me, My bowels have been troubled, Turned had been my heart in my middle, For I have greatly provoked, From without bereaved had the sword, In the house it is as death.
\v 21 They have heard that I have sighed, There is no comforter for me, All my enemies have heard of my calamity, They have rejoiced that You hast done it, You hast brought in the day You hast called, And they are like to me.
\v 22 Come in did all their evil before Thee, And one is doing to them as You hast done to me, For all my transgressions, For many are my sighs, and my heart is sick!

\v 1 How did the Lord cloud in His anger the daughter of Zion, He had cast from heaven to earth the beauty of Israel, And had not remembered His footstool in the day of His anger.
\v 2 Swallowed up had the Lord, He had not pitied any of the pleasant places of Jacob, He had broken down in His wrath The fortresses of the daughter of Judah, He had caused to come to the earth, He polluted the kingdom and its princes.
\v 3 He had cut off in the heat of anger every horn of Israel, He had turned backward His right hand From the face of the enemy, And He burneth against Jacob as a flaming fire, It had devoured round about.
\v 4 He had trodden His bow as an enemy, Stood had His right hand as an adversary, And He slaid all the desirable ones of the eye, In the tent of the daughter of Zion, He had poured out as fire His fury.
\v 5 The Lord had been as an enemy, He had swallowed up Israel, He had swallowed up all her palaces, He had destroyed His fortresses, And He multiplieth in the daughter of Judah Mourning and moaning.
\v 6 And He shaketh as a garden His tabernacle, He had destroyed His appointed place, Yahweh had forgotten in Zion the appointed time and sabbath, And despiseth, in the indignation of His anger, king and priest.
\v 7 The Lord had cast off His altar, He had rejected His sanctuary, He had shut up into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces, A noise they have made in the house of Yahweh Like a day of appointment.
\v 8 Devised had Yahweh to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion, He had stretched out a line, He had not turned His hand from destroying, And He caused bulwark and wall to mourn, Together — they have been weak.
\v 9 Sunk into the earth have her gates, He had destroyed and broken her bars, Her king and her princes are among the nations, There is no law, also her prophets Have not found vision from Yahweh.
\v 10 Sit on the earth — keep silent do the elders of the daughter of Zion, They have caused dust to go up on their head, They have girded on sackcloth, Put down to the earth their head have the virgins of Jerusalem.
\v 11 Consumed by tears have been my eyes, Troubled have been my bowels, Poured out to the earth had been my liver, For the breach of the daughter of my people; In infant and suckling being feeble, In the broad places of the city,
\v 12 To their mothers they say, 'Where are corn and wine?' In their becoming feeble as a pierced one In the broad places of the city, In their soul pouring itself out into the bosom of their mothers.
\v 13 What do I testify to you, what do I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? What do I equal to you, and I comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For great as a sea is your breach, Who did give healing to you?
\v 14 Your prophets have seen for you a false and insipid thing, And have not revealed concerning yours iniquity, To turn back your captivity, And they see for you false burdens and causes of expulsion.
\v 15 Clapped hands at you have all passing by the way, They have hissed — and they shake the head At the daughter of Jerusalem: 'Is this the city of which they said: The perfection of beauty, a joy to all the land?'
\v 16 Opened against you their mouth have all yours enemies, They have hissed, yea, they gnash the teeth, They have said: 'We have swallowed her up, Surely this is the day that we looked for, We have found — we have seen.'
\v 17 Yahweh had done that which He devised, He had fulfilled His saying That He commanded from the days of old, He had broken down and had not pitied, And caused an enemy to rejoice over you, He lifted up the horn of yours adversaries.
\v 18 Cried had their heart unto the Lord; O wall of the daughter of Zion, Cause to go down as a stream tears daily and nightly, Give not rest to thyself, Let not the daughter of yours eye stand still.
\v 19 Arise, cry aloud in the night, At the beginning of the watches. Pour out as water your heart, Over against the face of the Lord, Lift up unto Him your hands, for the soul of yours infants, Who are feeble with hunger at the head of all out-places.
\v 20 See, O Yahweh, and look attentively, To whom You hast acted thus, Do women eat their fruit, infants of a handbreadth? Slain in the sanctuary of the Lord are priest and prophet?
\v 21 Lain on the earth in out-places have young and old, My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword, You hast killed in a day of Thine anger, You hast slaughtered — You hast not pitied.
\v 22 You will call as at a day of appointment, My fears from round about, And there had not been in the day of the anger of Yahweh, An escaped and remaining one, They whom I stretched out and nourished, My enemy had consumed!

\v 1 I am the man who had seen affliction By the rod of His wrath.
\v 2 Me He had led, and caused to go in darkness, and without light.
\v 3 Surely against me He turneth back, He turneth His hand all the day.
\v 4 He had worn out my flesh and my skin. He had broken my bones.
\v 5 He had built up against me, And setteth round poverty and weariness.
\v 6 In dark places He had caused me to dwell, As the dead of old.
\v 7 He had hedged me about, and I go not out, He had made heavy my fetter.
\v 8 Also when I call and cry out, He had shut out my prayer.
\v 9 He had hedged my ways with hewn work, My paths He had made crooked.
\v 10 A bear lying in wait He is to me, A lion in secret hiding-places.
\v 11 My ways He is turning aside, and He pulleth me in pieces, He had made me a desolation.
\v 12 He had trodden His bow, And setteth me up as a mark for an arrow.
\v 13 He had caused to enter into my reins The sons of His quiver.
\v 14 I have been a derision to all my people, Their song all the day.
\v 15 He had filled me with bitter things, He had filled me with wormwood.
\v 16 And He breaketh with gravel my teeth, He had covered me with ashes.
\v 17 And You castest off from peace my soul, I have forgotten prosperity.
\v 18 And I say, Perished had my strength and my hope from Yahweh.
\v 19 Remember my affliction and my mourning, Wormwood and gall!
\v 20 Remember well, and bow down did my soul in me.
\v 21 This I turn to my heart — therefore I hope.
\v 22 The kindnesses of Yahweh! For we have not been consumed, For not ended have His mercies.
\v 23 New every morning, abundant is your faithfulness.
\v 24 My portion is Yahweh, had my soul said, Therefore I hope for Him.
\v 25 Good is Yahweh to those waiting for Him, To the soul that seeketh Him.
\v 26 Good! when one did stay and stand still For the salvation of Yahweh.
\v 27 Good for a man that he beareth a yoke in his youth.
\v 28 He sitteth alone, and is silent, For He had laid it upon him.
\v 29 He putteth in the dust his mouth, if so be there is hope.
\v 30 He gave to his smiter the cheek, He is filled with reproach.
\v 31 For the Lord did not cast off to the age.
\v 32 For though He afflicted, yet He had pitied, According to the abundance of His kindness.
\v 33 For He had not afflicted with His heart, Nor did He grieve the sons of men.
\v 34 To bruise under one's feet any bound ones of earth,
\v 35 To turn aside the judgment of a man, Over-against the face of the Most High,
\v 36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord had not approved.
\v 37 Who is this — he had said, and it is, And the Lord had not commanded it?
\v 38 From the mouth of the Most High Go not forth the evils and the good.
\v 39 What — sigh habitually did a living man, A man for his sin?
\v 40 We search our ways, and investigate, And turn back unto Yahweh.
\v 41 We lift up our heart on the hands unto God in the heavens.
\v 42 We — we have transgressed and rebelled, You — You hast not forgiven.
\v 43 You hast covered Yourself with anger, And will pursue us; You hast killed — You hast not pitied.
\v 44 You hast covered Yourself with a cloud, So that prayer did not pass through.
\v 45 Offscouring and refuse You will make us In the middle of the peoples.
\v 46 Opened against us their mouth have all our enemies.
\v 47 Fear and a snare had been for us, Desolation and destruction.
\v 48 Rivulets of water go down my eye, For the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\v 49 Mine eye is poured out, And did not cease without intermission,
\v 50 Till Yahweh looketh and saw from the heavens,
\v 51 My eye affecteth my soul, Because of all the daughters of my city.
\v 52 Hunted me sore as a bird have my enemies without cause.
\v 53 They have cut off in a pit my life, And they cast a stone against me.
\v 54 Flowed have waters over my head, I have said, I have been cut off.
\v 55 I called Your name, O Yahweh, from the lower pit.
\v 56 My voice You hast heard, Hide not Thine ear at my breathing — at my cry.
\v 57 You hast drawn near in the day I call Thee, You hast said, Fear not.
\v 58 You hast pleaded, O Lord, the pleadings of my soul, You hast redeemed my life.
\v 59 You hast seen, O Yahweh, my overthrow, Judge You my cause.
\v 60 You hast seen all their vengeance, All their thoughts of me.
\v 61 You hast heard their reproach, O Yahweh, All their thoughts against me,
\v 62 The lips of my withstanders, Even their meditation against me all the day.
\v 63 Their sitting down, and their rising up, Behold attentively, I am their song.
\v 64 You returnest to them the deed, O Yahweh, According to the work of their hands.
\v 65 You givest to them a covered heart, Your curse to them.
\v 66 You pursuest in anger, and destroyest them, From under the heavens of Yahweh!

\v 1 How is the gold become dim, Changed the best — the pure gold? Poured out are stones of the sanctuary At the head of all out-places.
\v 2 The precious sons of Zion, Who are comparable with fine gold, How have they been reckoned earthen bottles, Work of the hands of a potter.
\v 3 Even dragons have drawn out the breast, They have suckled their young ones, The daughter of my people is become cruel, Like the ostriches in a wilderness.
\v 4 Cleaved had the tongue of a suckling unto his palate with thirst, Infants asked bread, a dealer out they have none.
\v 5 Those eating of dainties have been desolate in out-places, Those supported on scarlet have embraced dunghills.
\v 6 And greater is the iniquity of the daughter of my people, Than the sin of Sodom, That was overturned as in a moment, And no hands were stayed on her.
\v 7 Purer were her Nazarites than snow, Whiter than milk, ruddier of body than rubies, Of sapphire their form.
\v 8 Darker than blackness had been their visage, They have not been known in out-places, Cleaved had their skin unto their bone, It had withered — it had been as wood.
\v 9 Better have been the pierced of a sword Than the pierced of famine, For these flow away, pierced through, Without the increase of the field.
\v 10 The hands of merciful women have boiled their own children, They have been for food to them, In the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\v 11 Completed had Yahweh His fury, He had poured out the fierceness of His anger, And he kindleth a fire in Zion, And it devoureth her foundations.
\v 12 Believe not did the kings of earth, And any of the inhabitants of the world, That come would an adversary and enemy Into the gates of Jerusalem.
\v 13 Because of the sins of her prophets, The iniquities of her priests, Who are shedding in her middle the blood of the righteous,
\v 14 They have wandered naked in out-places, They have been polluted with blood, Without any being able to touch their clothing,
\v 15 Turn aside — unclean,' they called to them, 'Turn aside, turn aside, touch not,' For they fled — yea, they have wandered, They have said among nations: 'They do not add to sojourn.'
\v 16 The face of Yahweh had divided them, He did not add to behold them, The face of priests they have not lifted up, Elders they have not favoured.
\v 17 While we exist — consumed are our eyes for our vain help, In our watch-tower we have watched for a nation that saveth not.
\v 18 They have hunted our steps from going in our broad-places, Near had been our end, fulfilled our days, For come had our end.
\v 19 Swifter have been our pursuers, Than the eagles of the heavens, On the mountains they have burned after us, In the wilderness they have laid wait for us.
\v 20 The breath of our nostrils — the anointed of Yahweh, Hath been captured in their pits, of whom we said: 'In his shadow we do live among nations.'
\v 21 Joy and rejoice, O daughter of Edom, Dwelling in the land of Uz, Even unto you pass over did a cup, You are drunk, and makest thyself naked.
\v 22 Completed is your iniquity, daughter of Zion, He did not add to remove you, He had inspected your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, He had removed you because of your sins!

\v 1 Remember, O Yahweh, what had befallen us, Look attentively, and see our reproach.
\v 2 Our inheritance had been turned to strangers, Our houses to foreigners.
\v 3 Orphans we have been — without a father, our mothers are as widows.
\v 4 Our water for money we have drunk, Our wood for a price did come.
\v 5 For our neck we have been pursued, We have laboured — there had been no rest for us.
\v 6 To Egypt we have given a hand, To Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.
\v 7 Our fathers have sinned — they are not, We their iniquities have borne.
\v 8 Servants have ruled over us, A deliverer there is none from their hand.
\v 9 With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
\v 10 Our skin as an oven had been burning, Because of the raging of the famine.
\v 11 Wives in Zion they have humbled, Virgins — in cities of Judah.
\v 12 Princes by their hand have been hanged, The faces of elders have not been honoured.
\v 13 Young men to grind they have taken, And youths with wood have stumbled.
\v 14 The aged from the gate have ceased, Young men from their song.
\v 15 Ceased had the joy of our heart, Turned to mourning had been our dancing.
\v 16 Fallen had the crown from our head, Woe is now to us, for we have sinned.
\v 17 For this had our heart been sick, For these have our eyes been dim.
\v 18 For the mount of Zion — that is desolate, Foxes have gone up on it.
\v 19 You, O Yahweh, to the age remainest, Your throne to generation and generation.
\v 20 Why for ever will You forget us? You forsakest us for length of days!
\v 21 Turn us back, O Yahweh, unto Thee, And we turn back, renew our days as of old.
\v 22 For hast You utterly rejected us? You hast been wroth against us — exceedingly?
