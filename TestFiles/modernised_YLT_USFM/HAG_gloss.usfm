\v 1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, had a word of Yahweh been by the hand of Haggai the prophet, unto Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and unto Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, saying:
\v 2 Thus spake Yahweh of Hosts, saying: This people! — they have said, 'The time had not come, The time the house of Yahweh is to be built.'
\v 3 And there is a word of Yahweh by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:
\v 4 Is it time for you — you! To dwell in your covered houses, And this house to lie waste?
\v 5 And now, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Set your heart to your ways.
\v 6 Ye have sown much, and brought in little, To eat, and not to satiety, To drink, and not to drunkenness, To clothe, and none had heat, And he who is hiring himself out, Is hiring himself for a bag pierced through.
\v 7 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Set your heart to your ways.
\v 8 Go up the mountain, and ye have brought in wood, And build the house, and I am pleased with it. And I am honoured, said Yahweh.
\v 9 Looking for much, and lo, little, And ye brought it home, and I blew on it, Wherefore? — an affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, Because of My house that is waste, And ye are running — each to his house,
\v 10 Therefore, over you refrained have the heavens from dew, And the land had refrained its increase.
\v 11 And I proclaim draught on the land, And on the mountains, and on the corn, And on the new wine, and on the oil, And on what the ground did bring forth, And on man, and on beast, And on all labour of the hands.'
\v 12 And Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, do hearken to the voice of Yahweh their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as Yahweh their God had sent him, and the people are afraid of the face of Yahweh.
\v 13 And Haggai, messenger of Yahweh, in messages of Yahweh, spoke to the people, saying: 'I am with you, an affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 14 And Yahweh did stir up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they come in, and do work in the house of Yahweh of Hosts their God,
\v 15 in the twenty and fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

\v 1 In the seventh month, in the twenty and first of the month, had a word of Yahweh been by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:
\v 2 'Speak, I pray thee, unto Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and unto Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, and unto the remnant of the people, saying:
\v 3 Who among you had been left that saw this house in its former honour? And what are ye seeing it now? Is it not, compared with it, as nothing in your eyes?
\v 4 And now, be strong, O Zerubbabel, An affirmation of Yahweh, And be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, And be strong, all ye people of the land, An affirmation of Yahweh, And do ye — (for I am with you, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts) — 
\v 5 The thing that I covenanted with you, In your coming forth from Egypt, And My Spirit is remaining in your middle, fear not.
\v 6 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Yet once more — it is a little, And I am shaking the heavens and the earth, And the sea, and the dry land,
\v 7 And I have shaken all the nations, And they have come to the desire of all the nations, And I have filled this house with honour, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 8 Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 9 Greater is the honour of this latter house, Than of the former, said Yahweh of Hosts, And in this place do I give peace, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.'
\v 10 On the twenty and fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, had a word of Yahweh been by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:
\v 11 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: 'Ask, I pray thee, the priests of the law, saying:
\v 12 Lo, one did carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and he had come with his skirt against the bread, or against the pottage, or against the wine, or against the oil, or against any food — is it holy?' And the priests answer and say, 'No.'
\v 13 And Haggai said, 'If the unclean of body did come against any of these, is it unclean?' And the priests answer and say, 'It is unclean.'
\v 14 And Haggai answereth and said, 'So is this people, and so is this nation before Me — an affirmation of Yahweh — and so is every work of their hands, and that which they bring near there — it is unclean.
\v 15 And now, lay it, I pray you, to your heart, From this day, and onwards, Before the laying of stone to stone in the temple of Yahweh.
\v 16 From that time one had come to a heap of twenty, And it had been ten, He had come unto the wine-fat to draw out fifty purahs, And it had been twenty.
\v 17 I have smitten you with blasting, And with mildew, and with hail — All the work of your hands, And there is none of you with Me, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 18 Set it, I pray you, to your heart, from this day and onwards, from the twenty and fourth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the temple of Yahweh had been founded, set it to your heart.
\v 19 Is the seed yet in the barn? And hitherto the vine and the fig, And the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, Have not borne — from this day I bless.'
\v 20 And there is a word of Yahweh a second time unto Haggai, on the twenty and fourth of the month, saying:
\v 21 'Speak unto Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying: I am shaking the heavens and the earth,
\v 22 And have overturned the throne of kingdoms, And I have destroyed the strength of kingdoms of the nations, And overturned chariot and its charioteers, And come down have horses and their riders, Each by the sword of his brother.
\v 23 In that day — an affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, I take thee, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant — an affirmation of Yahweh, And have set thee as a signet, for on thee I have fixed, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts!
