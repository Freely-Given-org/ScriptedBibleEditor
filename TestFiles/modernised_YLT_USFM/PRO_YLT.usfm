\v 1 Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
\v 2 For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,
\v 3 For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,
\v 4 For giving to simple ones — prudence, To a youth — knowledge and discretion.
\v 5 (The wise did hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent did obtain counsels.)
\v 6 For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.
\v 7 Fear of Yahweh is a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!
\v 8 Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, And leave not the law of your mother,
\v 9 For a graceful wreath are they to your head, And chains to your neck.
\v 10 My son, if sinners entice you be not willing.
\v 11 If they say, 'Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,
\v 12 We swallow them as Sheol — alive, And whole — as those going down to the pit,
\v 13 Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses with spoil,
\v 14 Your lot you will cast among us, One purse is — to all of us.'
\v 15 My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold your foot from their path,
\v 16 For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.
\v 17 Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.
\v 18 And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.
\v 19 So are the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it took.
\v 20 Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she gave forth her voice,
\v 21 At the head of the multitudes she called, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she said:
\v 22 'Till when, you simple, do you love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?
\v 23 Turn back at my reproof, behold, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.
\v 24 Because I have called, and you refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,
\v 25 And you slight all my counsel, And my reproof you have not desired.
\v 26 I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear came,
\v 27 When your fear came as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane did come, When on you come adversity and distress.
\v 28 Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.
\v 29 Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Yahweh have not chosen.
\v 30 They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,
\v 31 And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.
\v 32 For the turning of the simple slaid them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.
\v 33 And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And is quiet from fear of evil!'
\c 2
\v 1 My son, if you will accept my sayings, And my commands will lay up with you,
\v 2 To cause yours ear to attend to wisdom, You inclinest your heart to understanding,
\v 3 For, if for intelligence you callest, For understanding givest forth your voice,
\v 4 If you will seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,
\v 5 Then understandest you fear of Yahweh, And knowledge of God you findest.
\v 6 For Yahweh gave wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.
\v 7 Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.
\v 8 To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.
\v 9 Then understandest you righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness — every good path.
\v 10 For wisdom came into your heart, And knowledge to your soul is pleasant,
\v 11 Youghtfulness did watch over you, Understanding did keep you,
\v 12 To deliver you from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,
\v 13 Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,
\v 14 Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,
\v 15 Whose paths are crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.
\v 16 To deliver you from the strange woman, From the stranger who had made smooth her sayings,
\v 17 Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God had forgotten.
\v 18 For her house had inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.
\v 19 None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.
\v 20 That you will go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous will keep.
\v 21 For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,
\v 22 And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
\c 3
\v 1 My son! my law forget not, And my commands let your heart keep,
\v 2 For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to you.
\v 3 Let not kindness and truth forsake you, Bind them on your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart,
\v 4 And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.
\v 5 Trust unto Yahweh with all your heart, And unto yours own understanding lean not.
\v 6 In all your ways know you Him, And He did make straight your paths.
\v 7 Be not wise in yours own eyes, Fear Yahweh, and turn aside from evil.
\v 8 Healing it is to your navel, And moistening to your bones.
\v 9 Honour Yahweh from your substance, And from the beginning of all yours increase;
\v 10 And filled are your barns with plenty, And with new wine your presses break forth.
\v 11 Chastisement of Yahweh, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,
\v 12 For whom Yahweh loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.
\v 13 O the happiness of a man who had found wisdom, And of a man who brought forth understanding.
\v 14 For better is her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold — her increase.
\v 15 Precious she is above rubies, And all your pleasures are not comparable to her.
\v 16 Length of days is in her right hand, In her left are wealth and honour.
\v 17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.
\v 18 A tree of life she is to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her is happy.
\v 19 Yahweh by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.
\v 20 By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.
\v 21 My son! let them not turn from yours eyes, Keep you wisdom and thoughtfulness,
\v 22 And they are life to your soul, and grace to your neck.
\v 23 Then you goest your way confidently, And your foot did not stumble.
\v 24 If you liest down, you are not afraid, Yea, you hast lain down, And sweet had been your sleep.
\v 25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it came.
\v 26 For Yahweh is at your side, And He had kept your foot from capture.
\v 27 Withhold not good from its owners, When your hand is toward God to do it.
\v 28 Say not you to your friend, 'Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with you.
\v 29 Devise not against your neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with you.
\v 30 Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done you evil.
\v 31 Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix you on any of his ways.
\v 32 For an abomination to Yahweh is the perverted, And with the upright is His secret counsel.
\v 33 The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blessed.
\v 34 If the scorners He did scorn, Yet to the humble He did give grace.
\v 35 Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!
\c 4
\v 1 Hear, you sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.
\v 2 For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.
\v 3 For, a son I have been to my father — tender, And an only one before my mother.
\v 4 And he directeth me, and he said to me: 'Let your heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.
\v 6 Forsake her not, and she did preserve you, Love her, and she did keep you.
\v 7 The first thing is wisdom — get wisdom, And with all your getting get understanding.
\v 8 Exalt her, and she did lift you up, She honoureth you, when you will embrace her.
\v 9 She gave to your head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she did give you freely.
\v 10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life are multiplied to you.
\v 11 In a way of wisdom I have directed you, I have caused you to tread in paths of uprightness.
\v 12 In your walking your step is not straitened, And if you runnest, you stumblest not.
\v 13 Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she is your life.
\v 14 Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.
\v 15 Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.
\v 16 For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep had been taken violently away, If they cause not some to stumble.
\v 17 For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.
\v 18 And the path of the righteous is as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,
\v 19 The way of the wicked is as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.
\v 20 My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline yours ear,
\v 21 Let them not turn aside from yours eyes, Preserve them in the middle of your heart.
\v 22 For life they are to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.
\v 23 Above every charge keep your heart, For out of it are the outgoings of life.
\v 24 Turn aside from you a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from you,
\v 25 Thine eyes do look straightforward, And yours eyelids look straight before you.
\v 26 Ponder you the path of your feet, And all your ways are established.
\v 27 Incline not to the right or to the left, Turn aside your foot from evil!
\c 5
\v 1 My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline yours ear,
\v 2 To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do your lips keep.
\v 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil is her mouth,
\v 4 And her latter end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword with mouths.
\v 5 Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.
\v 6 The path of life — lest you ponder, Moved have her paths — you knowest not.
\v 7 And now, you sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.
\v 8 Keep far from off her your way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,
\v 9 Lest you give to others your honour, And your years to the fierce,
\v 10 Lest strangers be filled with your power, And your labours in the house of a stranger,
\v 11 And you hast howled in your latter end, In the consumption of your flesh and your food,
\v 12 And hast said, 'How have I hated instruction, And reproof had my heart despised,
\v 13 And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.
\v 14 As a little thing I have been all evil, In the middle of an assembly and a company.
\v 15 Drink waters out of yours own cistern, Even flowing ones out of yours own well.
\v 16 Let your fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.
\v 17 Let them be to you for thyself, And not to strangers with you.
\v 18 Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of your youth,
\v 19 A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy you at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.
\v 20 And why will you magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?
\v 21 For over-against the eyes of Yahweh are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.
\v 22 His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.
\v 23 He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!
\c 6
\v 1 My son! if you hast been surety for your friend, Hast stricken for a stranger your hand,
\v 2 Hast been snared with sayings of your mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of your mouth,
\v 3 Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For you hast come into the hand of your friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen your friend,
\v 4 Give not sleep to yours eyes, And slumber to yours eyelids,
\v 5 Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.
\v 6 Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;
\v 7 Which had not captain, overseer, and ruler,
\v 8 She did prepare in summer her bread, She had gathered in harvest her food.
\v 9 Till when, O slothful one, will you lie? When will you arise from your sleep?
\v 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,
\v 11 And your poverty had come as a traveller, And your want as an armed man.
\v 12 A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking with perverseness of mouth,
\v 13 Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,
\v 14 Frowardness is in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sent forth.
\v 15 Therefore suddenly came his calamity, Instantly he is broken — and no healing.
\v 16 These six had Yahweh hated, Yea, seven are abominations to His soul.
\v 17 Eyes high — tongues false — And hands shedding innocent blood — 
\v 18 A heart devising thoughts of vanity — Feet hasting to run to evil — 
\v 19 A false witness who did breathe out lies — And one sending forth contentions between brethren.
\v 20 Keep, my son, the command of your father, And leave not the law of your mother.
\v 21 Bind them on your heart continually, Tie them on your neck.
\v 22 In your going up and down, it leadeth you, In your lying down, it watcheth over you, And you hast awaked — it talketh with you.
\v 23 For a lamp is the command, And the law a light, And a way of life are reproofs of instruction,
\v 24 To preserve you from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
\v 25 Desire not her beauty in your heart, And let her not take you with her eyelids.
\v 26 For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.
\v 27 Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?
\v 28 Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?
\v 29 So is he who had gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who did touch her is innocent.
\v 30 They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,
\v 31 And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he gave.
\v 32 He who committeth adultery with a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who did it.
\v 33 A stroke and shame he did find, And his reproach is not wiped away,
\v 34 For jealousy is the fury of a man, And he did not spare in a day of vengeance.
\v 35 He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he did not consent, Yough you will multiply bribes!
\c 7
\v 1 My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with you.
\v 2 Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of yours eye.
\v 3 Bind them on your fingers, Write them on the tablet of your heart.
\v 4 Say to wisdom, 'My sister You are.' And cry to understanding, 'Kinswoman!'
\v 5 To preserve you from a strange woman, From a stranger who had made smooth her sayings.
\v 6 For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out,
\v 7 And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,
\v 8 Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way to her house he did step,
\v 9 In the twilight — in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness.
\v 10 And, behold, a woman to meet him — (A harlot's dress, and watchful of heart,
\v 11 Noisy she is, and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not.
\v 12 Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) — 
\v 13 And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She had hardened her face, and said to him,
\v 14 Sacrifices of peace-offerings are by me, To-day I have completed my vows.
\v 15 Therefore I have come forth to meet you, To seek earnestly your face, and I find you.
\v 16 With ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works — cotton of Egypt.
\v 17 I sprinkled my bed — myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
\v 18 Come, we are filled with loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.
\v 19 For the man is not in his house, He had gone on a long journey.
\v 20 A bag of money he had taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he came to his house.'
\v 21 She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.
\v 22 He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he came, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool,
\v 23 Till an arrow did split his liver, As a bird had hastened unto a snare, And had not known that it is for its life.
\v 24 And now, you sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth.
\v 25 Let not your heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths,
\v 26 For many are the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty are all her killed ones.
\v 27 The ways of Sheol — her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death!
\c 8
\v 1 Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?
\v 2 At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she had stood,
\v 3 At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,
\v 4 Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice is unto the sons of men.
\v 5 Understand, you simple ones, prudence, And you fools, understand the heart,
\v 6 Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips is uprightness.
\v 7 For truth did my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips is wickedness.
\v 8 In righteousness are all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.
\v 9 All of them are plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.
\v 10 Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.
\v 11 For better is wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.
\v 12 I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.
\v 13 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.
\v 14 Mine is counsel and substance, I am understanding, I have might.
\v 15 By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,
\v 16 By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.
\v 17 I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.
\v 18 Wealth and honour are with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.
\v 19 Better is my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.
\v 20 In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In middle of paths of judgment,
\v 21 To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.
\v 22 Yahweh possessed me — the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.
\v 23 From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.
\v 24 In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy with waters,
\v 25 Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.
\v 26 While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.
\v 27 In His preparing the heavens I am there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,
\v 28 In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,
\v 29 In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,
\v 30 Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight — day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,
\v 31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights are with the sons of men.
\v 32 And now, you sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.
\v 33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.
\v 34 O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.
\v 35 For whoso is finding me, had found life, And brought out good-will from Yahweh.
\v 36 And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!
\c 9
\v 1 Wisdom had builded her house, She had hewn out her pillars — seven.
\v 2 She had slaughtered her slaughter, She had mingled her wine, Yea, she had arranged her table.
\v 3 She had sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:
\v 4 Who is simple? let him turn aside hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she had said to him,
\v 5 'Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine I have mingled.
\v 6 Forsake you, the simple, and live, And be happy in the way of understanding.
\v 7 The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it — shame, And a reprover of the wicked — his blemish.
\v 8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you, Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth you.
\v 9 Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning.
\v 10 The commencement of wisdom is the fear of Yahweh, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones is understanding.
\v 11 For by me do your days multiply, And added to you are years of life.
\v 12 If you hast been wise, you hast been wise for thyself, And you hast scorned — thyself bearest it.
\v 13 A foolish woman is noisy, Simple, and had not known what.
\v 14 And she had sat at the opening of her house, On a throne — the high places of the city,
\v 15 To call to those passing by the way, Who are going straight on their paths.
\v 16 Who is simple? let him turn aside hither.' And whoso lacketh heart — she said to him,
\v 17 'Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden bread is pleasant.'
\v 18 And he had not known that Rephaim are there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!
\c 10
\v 1 Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son caused a father to rejoice, And a foolish son is an affliction to his mother.
\v 2 Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.
\v 3 Yahweh caused not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.
\v 4 Poor is he who is working — a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent made rich.
\v 5 Whoso is gathering in summer is a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest is a son causing shame.
\v 6 Blessings are for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover did violence.
\v 7 The remembrance of the righteous is for a blessing, And the name of the wicked did rot.
\v 8 The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.
\v 9 Whoso is walking in integrity walks confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.
\v 10 Whoso is winking the eye gave grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.
\v 11 A fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover did violence.
\v 12 Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.
\v 13 In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod is for the back of him who is lacking understanding.
\v 14 The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool is near ruin.
\v 15 The wealth of the rich is his strong city, The ruin of the poor is their poverty.
\v 16 The wage of the righteous is for life, The increase of the wicked for sin.
\v 17 A traveller to life is he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.
\v 18 Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.
\v 19 In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips is wise.
\v 20 The tongue of the righteous is chosen silver, The heart of the wicked — as a little thing.
\v 21 The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.
\v 22 The blessing of Yahweh — it made rich, And He addeth no grief with it.
\v 23 To execute inventions is as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.
\v 24 The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.
\v 25 As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.
\v 26 As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So is the slothful to those sending him.
\v 27 The fear of Yahweh addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.
\v 28 The hope of the righteous is joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.
\v 29 The way of Yahweh is strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.
\v 30 The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.
\v 31 The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.
\v 32 The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!
\c 11
\v 1 Balances of deceit are an abomination to Yahweh, And a perfect weight is His delight.
\v 2 Pride had come, and shame came, And with the lowly is wisdom.
\v 3 The integrity of the upright leadeth them, And the perverseness of the treacherous destroyeth them.
\v 4 Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath, And righteousness delivereth from death.
\v 5 The righteousness of the perfect made right his way, And by his wickedness did the wicked fall.
\v 6 The righteousness of the upright delivereth them, And in mischief the treacherous are captured.
\v 7 In the death of a wicked man, hope perisheth, And the expectation of the iniquitous had been lost.
\v 8 The righteous from distress is drawn out, And the wicked went in instead of him.
\v 9 With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his friend, And by knowledge the righteous are drawn out.
\v 10 In the good of the righteous a city exulteth, And in the destruction of the wicked is singing.
\v 11 By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted, And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down.
\v 12 Whoso is despising his neighbour lacketh heart, And a man of understanding keepeth silence.
\v 13 A busybody is revealing secret counsel, And the faithful of spirit is covering the matter.
\v 14 Without counsels do a people fall, And deliverance is in a multitude of counsellors.
\v 15 Evil one suffereth when he had been surety for a stranger, And whoso is hating suretyship is confident.
\v 16 A gracious woman retaineth honour, And terrible men retain riches.
\v 17 A kind man is rewarding his own soul, And the fierce is troubling his own flesh.
\v 18 The wicked is getting a lying wage, And whoso is sowing righteousness — a true reward.
\v 19 Rightly is righteousness for life, And whoso is pursuing evil — for his own death.
\v 20 An abomination to Yahweh are the perverse of heart, And the perfect of the way are His delight.
\v 21 Hand to hand, the wicked is not acquitted, And the seed of the righteous had escaped.
\v 22 A ring of gold in the nose of a sow — A fair woman and stubborn of behaviour.
\v 23 The desire of the righteous is only good, The hope of the wicked is transgression.
\v 24 There is who is scattering, and yet is increased, And who is keeping back from uprightness, only to want.
\v 25 A liberal soul is made fat, And whoso is watering, he also is watered.
\v 26 Whoso is withholding corn, the people execrate him, And a blessing is for the head of him who is selling.
\v 27 Whoso is earnestly seeking good Seeketh a pleasing thing, And whoso is seeking evil — it meeteth him.
\v 28 Whoso is confident in his wealth he falleth, And as a leaf, the righteous flourish.
\v 29 Whoso is troubling his own house inheriteth wind, And a servant is the fool to the wise of heart.
\v 30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And whoso is taking souls is wise.
\v 31 Lo, the righteous in the earth is recompensed, Surely also the wicked and the sinner!
\c 12
\v 1 Whoso is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof is brutish.
\v 2 The good brought forth favour from Yahweh, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.
\v 3 A man is not established by wickedness, And the root of the righteous is not moved.
\v 4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, And as rottenness in his bones is one causing shame.
\v 5 The thoughts of the righteous are justice, The counsels of the wicked — deceit.
\v 6 The words of the wicked are: 'Lay wait for blood,' And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.
\v 7 Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, And the house of the righteous standeth.
\v 8 According to his wisdom is a man praised, And the perverted of heart became despised.
\v 9 Better is the lightly esteemed who had a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.
\v 10 The righteous knoweth the life of his beast, And the mercies of the wicked are cruel.
\v 11 Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied with bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking heart,
\v 12 The wicked had desired the net of evil doers, And the root of the righteous gave.
\v 13 In transgression of the lips is the snare of the wicked, And the righteous went out from distress.
\v 14 From the fruit of the mouth is one satisfied with good, And the deed of man's hands returneth to him.
\v 15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel is wise.
\v 16 The fool — in a day is his anger known, And the prudent is covering shame.
\v 17 Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness, And a false witness — deceit.
\v 18 A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.
\v 19 The lip of truth is established for ever, And for a moment — a tongue of falsehood.
\v 20 Deceit is in the heart of those devising evil, And to those counselling peace is joy.
\v 21 No iniquity is desired by the righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.
\v 22 An abomination to Yahweh are lying lips, And stedfast doers are his delight.
\v 23 A prudent man is concealing knowledge, And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.
\v 24 The hand of the diligent ruleth, And slothfulness became tributary.
\v 25 Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down, And a good word made him glad.
\v 26 The righteous searcheth his companion, And the way of the wicked caused them to err.
\v 27 The slothful roasteth not his hunting, And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.
\v 28 In the path of righteousness is life, And in the way of that path is no death!
\c 13
\v 1 A wise son — the instruction of a father, And a scorner — he had not heard rebuke.
\v 2 From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous — violence.
\v 3 Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips — ruin to him!
\v 4 The soul of the slothful is desiring, and had not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.
\v 5 A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked caused abhorrence, and is confounded.
\v 6 Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.
\v 7 There is who is making himself rich, and had nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth is abundant.
\v 8 The ransom of a man's life are his riches, And the poor had not heard rebuke.
\v 9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.
\v 10 A vain man through pride caused debate, And with the counselled is wisdom.
\v 11 Wealth from vanity became little, And whoso is gathering by the hand became great.
\v 12 Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life is the coming desire.
\v 13 Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.
\v 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.
\v 15 Good understanding gave grace, And the way of the treacherous is hard.
\v 16 Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.
\v 17 A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.
\v 18 Whoso is refusing instruction — poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.
\v 19 A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools is: Turn from evil.
\v 20 Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.
\v 21 Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.
\v 22 A good man caused sons' sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous is the sinner's wealth.
\v 23 Abundance of food — the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.
\v 24 Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him had hastened him chastisement.
\v 25 The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!
\c 14
\v 1 Every wise woman had builded her house, And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.
\v 2 Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Yahweh, And the perverted in his ways is despising Him.
\v 3 In the mouth of a fool is a rod of pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them.
\v 4 Without oxen a stall is clean, And great is the increase by the power of the ox.
\v 5 A faithful witness lieth not, And a false witness breatheth out lies.
\v 6 A scorner had sought wisdom, and it is not, And knowledge to the intelligent is easy.
\v 7 Go from before a foolish man, Or you hast not known the lips of knowledge.
\v 8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way, And the folly of fools is deceit.
\v 9 Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among the upright — a pleasing thing.
\v 10 The heart knoweth its own bitterness, And with its joy a stranger did not intermeddle.
\v 11 The house of the wicked is destroyed, And the tent of the upright flourisheth.
\v 12 There is a way — right before a man, And its latter end are ways of death.
\v 13 Even in laughter is the heart pained, And the latter end of joy is affliction.
\v 14 From his ways is the backslider in heart filled, And a good man — from his fruits.
\v 15 The simple gave credence to everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.
\v 16 The wise is fearing and turning from evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.
\v 17 Whoso is short of temper did folly, And a man of wicked devices is hated.
\v 18 The simple have inherited folly, And the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
\v 19 The evil have bowed down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
\v 20 Even of his neighbour is the poor hated, And those loving the rich are many.
\v 21 Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.
\v 22 Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth are to those devising good,
\v 23 In all labour there is advantage, And a thing of the lips is only to want.
\v 24 The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools is folly.
\v 25 A true witness is delivering souls, And a deceitful one breatheth out lies.
\v 26 In the fear of Yahweh is strong confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge.
\v 27 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.
\v 28 In the multitude of a people is the honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince.
\v 29 Whoso is slow to anger is of great understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly.
\v 30 A healed heart is life to the flesh, And rottenness to the bones is envy.
\v 31 An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.
\v 32 In his wickedness is the wicked driven away, And trustful in his death is the righteous.
\v 33 In the heart of the intelligent wisdom did rest. And in the middle of fools it is known.
\v 34 Righteousness exalteth a nation, And the goodliness of peoples is a sin-offering.
\v 35 The favour of a king is to a wise servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!
\c 15
\v 1 A soft answer turneth back fury, And a grievous word raiseth up anger.
\v 2 The tongue of the wise made knowledge good, And the mouth of fools uttereth folly.
\v 3 In every place are the eyes of Yahweh, Watching the evil and the good.
\v 4 A healed tongue is a tree of life, And perverseness in it — a breach in the spirit.
\v 5 A fool despiseth the instruction of his father, And whoso is regarding reproof is prudent.
\v 6 In the house of the righteous is abundant strength, And in the increase of the wicked — trouble.
\v 7 The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, And the heart of fools is not right.
\v 8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, And the prayer of the upright is His delight.
\v 9 An abomination to Yahweh is the way of the wicked, And whoso is pursuing righteousness He loveth.
\v 10 Chastisement is grievous to him who is forsaking the path, Whoso is hating reproof dieth.
\v 11 Sheol and destruction are before Yahweh, Surely also the hearts of the sons of men.
\v 12 A scorner loveth not his reprover, Unto the wise he went not.
\v 13 A joyful heart made glad the face, And by grief of heart is the spirit smitten.
\v 14 The heart of the intelligent seeketh knowledge, And the mouth of fools enjoyeth folly.
\v 15 All the days of the afflicted are evil, And gladness of heart is a perpetual banquet.
\v 16 Better is a little with the fear of Yahweh, Than much treasure, and tumult with it.
\v 17 Better is an allowance of green herbs and love there, Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it.
\v 18 A man of fury stirreth up contention, And the slow to anger appeaseth strife.
\v 19 The way of the slothful is as a hedge of briers, And the path of the upright is raised up.
\v 20 A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a foolish man is despising his mother.
\v 21 Folly is joy to one lacking heart, And a man of intelligence directeth his going.
\v 22 Without counsel is the making void of purposes, And in a multitude of counsellors it is established.
\v 23 Joy is to a man in the answer of his mouth, And a word in its season — how good!
\v 24 A path of life is on high for the wise, To turn aside from Sheol beneath.
\v 25 The house of the proud Yahweh pulleth down, And He setteth up the border of the widow.
\v 26 An abomination to Yahweh are thoughts of wickedness, And pure are sayings of pleasantness.
\v 27 A dishonest gainer is troubling his house, And whoso is hating gifts lived.
\v 28 The heart of the righteous meditateth to answer, And the mouth of the wicked uttereth evil things.
\v 29 Far is Yahweh from the wicked, And the prayer of the righteous He heareth.
\v 30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart, A good report made fat the bone.
\v 31 An ear that is hearing the reproof of life Doth lodge among the wise.
\v 32 Whoso is refusing instruction is despising his soul, And whoso is hearing reproof Is getting understanding.
\v 33 The fear of Yahweh is the instruction of wisdom, And before honour is humility!
\c 16
\v 1 Of man are arrangements of the heart, And from Yahweh an answer of the tongue.
\v 2 All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, And Yahweh is pondering the spirits.
\v 3 Roll unto Yahweh your works, And established are your purposes,
\v 4 All things had Yahweh wrought for Himself, And also the wicked worketh for a day of evil.
\v 5 An abomination to Yahweh is every proud one of heart, Hand to hand he is not acquitted.
\v 6 In kindness and truth pardoned is iniquity, And in the fear of Yahweh Turn you aside from evil.
\v 7 When a man's ways please Yahweh, even his enemies, He caused to be at peace with him.
\v 8 Better is a little with righteousness, Than abundance of increase without justice.
\v 9 The heart of man deviseth his way, And Yahweh establisheth his step.
\v 10 An oath is on the lips of a king, In judgment his mouth trespasseth not.
\v 11 A just beam and balances are Yahweh's, His work are all the stones of the bag.
\v 12 An abomination to kings is doing wickedness, For by righteousness is a throne established.
\v 13 The delight of kings are righteous lips, And whoso is speaking uprightly he loveth,
\v 14 The fury of a king is messengers of death, And a wise man pacifieth it.
\v 15 In the light of a king's face is life, And his good-will is as a cloud of the latter rain.
\v 16 To get wisdom — how much better than gold, And to get understanding to be chosen than silver!
\v 17 A highway of the upright is, 'Turn from evil,' Whoso is preserving his soul is watching his way.
\v 18 Before destruction is pride, And before stumbling — a haughty spirit.'
\v 19 Better is humility of spirit with the poor, Than to apportion spoil with the proud.
\v 20 The wise in any matter finds good, And whoso is trusting in Yahweh, O his happiness.
\v 21 To the wise in heart is called, 'Intelligent,' And sweetness of lips increaseth learning.
\v 22 A fountain of life is understanding to its possessors, The instruction of fools is folly.
\v 23 The heart of the wise caused his mouth to act wisely, And by his lips he increaseth learning,
\v 24 Sayings of pleasantness are a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone.
\v 25 There is a way right before a man, And its latter end — ways of death.
\v 26 A labouring man had laboured for himself, For his mouth had caused him to bend over it.
\v 27 A worthless man is preparing evil, And on his lips — as a burning fire.
\v 28 A froward man sent forth contention, A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend.
\v 29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, And had caused him to go in a way not good.
\v 30 Consulting his eyes to devise froward things, Moving his lips he had accomplished evil.
\v 31 A crown of beauty are grey hairs, In the way of righteousness it is found.
\v 32 Better is the slow to anger than the mighty, And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city.
\v 33 Into the centre is the lot cast, And from Yahweh is all its judgment!
\c 17
\v 1 Better is a dry morsel, and rest with it, Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife.
\v 2 A wise servant ruleth over a son causing shame, And in the middle of brethren He apportioneth an inheritance.
\v 3 A refining pot is for silver, and a furnace for gold, And the trier of hearts is Yahweh.
\v 4 An evil doer is attentive to lips of vanity, Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue.
\v 5 Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath reproached his Maker, Whoso is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted.
\v 6 Sons' sons are the crown of old men, And the glory of sons are their fathers.
\v 7 Not comely for a fool is a lip of excellency, Much less for a noble a lip of falsehood.
\v 8 A stone of grace is the bribe in the eyes of its possessors, Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
\v 9 Whoso is covering transgression is seeking love, And whoso is repeating a matter Is separating a familiar friend.
\v 10 Rebuke came down on the intelligent More than a hundred stripes on a fool.
\v 11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion, And a fierce messenger is sent against him.
\v 12 The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man, And — not a fool in his folly.
\v 13 Whoso is returning evil for good, Evil moveth not from his house.
\v 14 The beginning of contention is a letting out of waters, And before it is meddled with leave the strife.
\v 15 Whoso is justifying the wicked, And condemning the righteous, Even both of these are an abomination to Yahweh.
\v 16 Why is this — a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, And a heart there is none?
\v 17 At all times is the friend loving, And a brother for adversity is born.
\v 18 A man lacking heart is striking hands, A surety he became before his friend.
\v 19 Whoso is loving transgression is loving debate, Whoso is making high his entrance is seeking destruction.
\v 20 The perverse of heart finds not good, And the turned in his tongue falleth into evil.
\v 21 Whoso is begetting a fool had affliction for it, Yea, the father of a fool rejoiceth not.
\v 22 A rejoicing heart did good to the body, And a smitten spirit drieth the bone.
\v 23 A bribe from the bosom the wicked took, To turn aside the paths of judgment.
\v 24 The face of the intelligent is to wisdom, And the eyes of a fool — at the end of the earth.
\v 25 A provocation to his father is a foolish son, And bitterness to her that bare him.
\v 26 Also, to fine the righteous is not good, To smite nobles for uprightness.
\v 27 One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, And the cool of temper is a man of understanding.
\v 28 Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, He who is shutting his lips intelligent!
\c 18
\v 1 For an object of desire he who is separated did seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth.
\v 2 A fool delighteth not in understanding, But — in uncovering his heart.
\v 3 With the coming of the wicked come also had contempt, And with shame — reproach.
\v 4 Deep waters are the words of a man's mouth, The fountain of wisdom is a flowing brook.
\v 5 Acceptance of the face of the wicked is not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment.
\v 6 The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth for stripes called.
\v 7 The mouth of a fool is ruin to him, And his lips are the snare of his soul.
\v 8 The words of a tale-bearer are as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down to the inner parts of the heart.
\v 9 He also that is remiss in his work, A brother he is to a destroyer.
\v 10 A tower of strength is the name of Yahweh, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high.
\v 11 The wealth of the rich is the city of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination.
\v 12 Before destruction the heart of man is high, And before honour is humility.
\v 13 Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.
\v 14 The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness, And a smitten spirit who did bear?
\v 15 The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
\v 16 The gift of a man made room for him, And before the great it leadeth him.
\v 17 Righteous is the first in his own cause, His neighbour came and had searched him.
\v 18 The lot caused contentions to cease, And between the mighty it separated.
\v 19 A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.
\v 20 From the fruit of a man's mouth is his belly satisfied, From the increase of his lips he is satisfied.
\v 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.
\v 22 Whoso had found a wife had found good, And brought out good-will from Yahweh.
\v 23 With supplications did the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.
\v 24 A man with friends is to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
\c 19
\v 1 Better is the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse in his lips, who is a fool.
\v 2 Also, without knowledge the soul is not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning.
\v 3 The folly of man perverteth his way, And against Yahweh is his heart wroth.
\v 4 Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor from his neighbour is separated.
\v 5 A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso breatheth out lies is not delivered.
\v 6 Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.
\v 7 All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words — they are not!
\v 8 Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.
\v 9 A false witness is not acquitted, And whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.
\v 10 Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule among princes.
\v 11 The wisdom of a man had deferred his anger, And his glory is to pass over transgression.
\v 12 The wrath of a king is a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.
\v 13 A calamity to his father is a foolish son, And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
\v 14 House and wealth are the inheritance of fathers, And from Yahweh is an understanding wife.
\v 15 Sloth caused deep sleep to fall, And an indolent soul did hunger.
\v 16 Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.
\v 17 Whoso is lending to Yahweh is favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him.
\v 18 Chastise your son, for there is hope, And to put him to death lift not up your soul.
\v 19 A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if you will deliver, yet again you will add.
\v 20 Hear counsel and receive instruction, So that you are wise in your latter end.
\v 21 Many are the purposes in a man's heart, And the counsel of Yahweh it standeth.
\v 22 The desirableness of a man is his kindness, And better is the poor than a liar.
\v 23 The fear of Yahweh is to life, And satisfied he remaineth — he is not charged with evil.
\v 24 The slothful had hidden his hand in a dish, Even unto his mouth he brought it not back.
\v 25 A scorner smite, and the simple acts prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth knowledge.
\v 26 Whoso is spoiling a father caused a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.
\v 27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction — To err from sayings of knowledge.
\v 28 A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.
\v 29 Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!
\c 20
\v 1 Wine is a scorner — strong drink is noisy, And any going astray in it is not wise.
\v 2 The fear of a king is a growl as of a young lion, He who is causing him to be wroth is wronging his soul.
\v 3 An honour to a man is cessation from strife, And every fool intermeddleth.
\v 4 Because of winter the slothful plougheth not, He asketh in harvest, and there is nothing.
\v 5 Counsel in the heart of a man is deep water, And a man of understanding draweth it up.
\v 6 A multitude of men proclaim each his kindness, And a man of stedfastness who did find?
\v 7 The righteous is walking habitually in his integrity, O the happiness of his sons after him!
\v 8 A king sitting on a throne of judgment, Is scattering with his eyes all evil,
\v 9 Who said, 'I have purified my heart, I have been cleansed from my sin?'
\v 10 A stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah, Even both of them are an abomination to Yahweh.
\v 11 Even by his actions a youth made himself known, Whether his work be pure or upright.
\v 12 A hearing ear, and a seeing eye, Yahweh had made even both of them.
\v 13 Love not sleep, lest you become poor, Open yours eyes — be satisfied with bread.
\v 14 'Bad, bad,' said the buyer, And going his way then he boasteth himself.
\v 15 Substance, gold, and a multitude of rubies, Yea, a precious vessel, are lips of knowledge.
\v 16 Take his garment when a stranger had been surety, And for strangers pledge it.
\v 17 Sweet to a man is the bread of falsehood, And afterwards is his mouth filled with gravel.
\v 18 Purposes by counsel you will establish, And with plans make you war.
\v 19 A revealer of secret counsels is the busybody, And for a deceiver with his lips make not thyself surety.
\v 20 Whoso is vilifying his father and his mother, Extinguished is his lamp in blackness of darkness.
\v 21 An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, Even its latter end is not blessed.
\v 22 Do not say, 'I recompense evil,' Wait for Yahweh, and He delivereth you.
\v 23 An abomination to Yahweh are a stone and a stone, And balances of deceit are not good.
\v 24 From Yahweh are the steps of a man, And man — how understandeth he his way?
\v 25 A snare to a man is he had swallowed a holy thing, And after vows to make inquiry.
\v 26 A wise king is scattering the wicked, And turneth back on them the wheel.
\v 27 The breath of man is a lamp of Yahweh, Searching all the inner parts of the heart.
\v 28 Kindness and truth keep a king, And he had supported by kindness his throne.
\v 29 The beauty of young men is their strength, And the honour of old men is grey hairs.
\v 30 The bandages of a wound you removest with the evil, Also the plagues of the inner parts of the heart!
\c 21
\v 1 Rivulets of waters is the heart of a king in the hand of Yahweh, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.
\v 2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, And Yahweh is pondering hearts.
\v 3 To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Yahweh rather than sacrifice.
\v 4 Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked is sin.
\v 5 The purposes of the diligent are only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.
\v 6 The making of treasures by a lying tongue, Is a vanity driven away of those seeking death.
\v 7 The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.
\v 8 Froward is the way of a man who is vile, And the pure — upright is his work.
\v 9 Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than with a woman of contentions and a house of company.
\v 10 The soul of the wicked had desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.
\v 11 When the scorner is punished, the simple became wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.
\v 12 The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.
\v 13 Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also did cry, and is not answered.
\v 14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.
\v 15 To do justice is joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.
\v 16 A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim rested.
\v 17 Whoso is loving mirth is a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil made no wealth.
\v 18 The wicked is an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.
\v 19 Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than with a woman of contentions and anger.
\v 20 A treasure to be desired, and oil, Is in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up.
\v 21 Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
\v 22 A city of the mighty had the wise gone up, And brought down the strength of its confidence.
\v 23 Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.
\v 24 Proud, haughty, scorner is his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.
\v 25 The desire of the slothful slaid him, For his hands have refused to work.
\v 26 All the day desiring he had desired, And the righteous gave and withholdeth not.
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination, Much more when in wickedness he brought it.
\v 28 A false witness did perish, And an attentive man for ever spoke.
\v 29 A wicked man had hardened by his face, And the upright — he prepared his way.
\v 30 There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Yahweh.
\v 31 A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance is of Yahweh!
\c 22
\v 1 A name is chosen rather than much wealth, Than silver and than gold — good grace.
\v 2 Rich and poor have met together, The Maker of them all is Yahweh.
\v 3 The prudent had seen the evil, and is hidden, And the simple have passed on, and are punished.
\v 4 The end of humility is the fear of Yahweh, Riches, and honour, and life.
\v 5 Thorns — snares are in the way of the perverse, Whoso is keeping his soul is far from them.
\v 6 Give instruction to a youth about his way, Even when he is old he turneth not from it.
\v 7 The rich over the poor ruleth, And a servant is the borrower to the lender.
\v 8 Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth sorrow, And the rod of his anger weareth out.
\v 9 The good of eye — he is blessed, For he had given of his bread to the poor.
\v 10 Cast out a scorner — and contention went out, And strife and shame cease.
\v 11 Whoso is loving cleanness of heart, Grace are his lips, a king is his friend.
\v 12 The eyes of Yahweh have kept knowledge, And He overthroweth the words of the treacherous.
\v 13 The slothful had said, 'A lion is without, In the middle of the broad places I am killed.'
\v 14 A deep pit is the mouth of strange women, The abhorred of Yahweh falleth there.
\v 15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth, The rod of chastisement putteth it far from him.
\v 16 He is oppressing the poor to multiply to him, He is giving to the rich — only to want.
\v 17 Incline yours ear, and hear words of the wise, And your heart set to my knowledge,
\v 18 For they are pleasant when you will keep them in your heart, They are prepared together for your lips.
\v 19 That your trust may be in Yahweh, I caused you to know to-day, even you.
\v 20 Have I not written to you three times With counsels and knowledge?
\v 21 To cause you to know the certainty of sayings of truth, To return sayings of truth to those sending you.
\v 22 Rob not the poor because he is poor, And bruise not the afflicted in the gate.
\v 23 For Yahweh pleadeth their cause, And had spoiled the soul of their spoilers.
\v 24 Shew not thyself friendly with an angry man, And with a man of fury go not in,
\v 25 Lest you learn his paths, And have received a snare to your soul.
\v 26 Be not you among those striking hands, Among sureties for burdens.
\v 27 If you hast nothing to pay, Why did he take your bed from under you?
\v 28 Remove not a border of olden times, That your fathers have made.
\v 29 Hast you seen a man speedy in his business? Before kings he did station himself, He stations not himself before obscure men!
\c 23
\v 1 When you sittest to eat with a ruler, You considerest diligently that which is before you,
\v 2 And you hast put a knife to your throat, If you are a man of appetite.
\v 3 Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it is lying food.
\v 4 Labour not to make wealth, From yours own understanding cease, Dost you cause yours eyes to fly upon it? Then it is not.
\v 5 For wealth made to itself wings, As an eagle it flieth to the heavens.
\v 6 Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And have no desire to his dainties,
\v 7 For as he had thought in his soul, so is he, 'Eat and drink,' said he to you, And his heart is not with you.
\v 8 Your morsel you hast eaten you will vomit up, And hast marred your words that are sweet.
\v 9 In the ears of a fool speak not, For he treadeth on the wisdom of your words.
\v 10 Remove not a border of olden times, And into fields of the fatherless enter not,
\v 11 For their Redeemer is strong, He did plead their cause with you.
\v 12 Bring in to instruction your heart, And yours ear to sayings of knowledge.
\v 13 Withhold not from a youth chastisement, When you smitest him with a rod he dieth not.
\v 14 You with a rod smitest him, And his soul from Sheol you deliverest.
\v 15 My son, if your heart had been wise, My heart rejoiceth, even mine,
\v 16 And my reins exult when your lips speak uprightly.
\v 17 Let not your heart be envious at sinners, But — in the fear of Yahweh all the day.
\v 18 For, is there a posterity? Then your hope is not cut off.
\v 19 Hear you, my son, and be wise, And make happy in the way your heart,
\v 20 Be not you among quaffers of wine, Among gluttonous ones of flesh,
\v 21 For the quaffer and glutton become poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.
\v 22 Hearken to your father, who begat you, And despise not your mother when she had become old.
\v 23 Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and instruction, and understanding,
\v 24 The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.
\v 25 Rejoice did your father and your mother, Yea, she that bare you is joyful.
\v 26 Give, my son, your heart to me, And let yours eyes watch my ways.
\v 27 For a harlot is a deep ditch, And a strange woman is a strait pit.
\v 28 She also, as catching prey, lieth in wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.
\v 29 Who had woe? who had sorrow? Who had contentions? who had plaint? Who had wounds without cause? Who had redness of eyes?
\v 30 Those tarrying by the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.
\v 31 See not wine when it showeth itself red, When it gave in the cup its colour, It went up and down through the upright.
\v 32 Its latter end — as a serpent it biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.
\v 33 Thine eyes see strange women, And your heart spoke perverse things.
\v 34 And you hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.
\v 35 They smote me, I have not been sick, They beat me, I have not known. When I awake — I seek it yet again!'
\c 24
\v 1 Be not envious of evil men, And desire not to be with them.
\v 2 For destruction did their heart meditate, And perverseness do their lips speak.
\v 3 By wisdom is a house builded, And by understanding it establisheth itself.
\v 4 And by knowledge the inner parts are filled, With all precious and pleasant wealth.
\v 5 Mighty is the wise in strength, And a man of knowledge is strengthening power,
\v 6 For by plans you makest for thyself war, And deliverance is in a multitude of counsellors.
\v 7 Wisdom is high for a fool, In the gate he opened not his mouth.
\v 8 Whoso is devising to do evil, Him they call a master of wicked thoughts.
\v 9 The thought of folly is sin, And an abomination to man is a scorner.
\v 10 You hast showed thyself weak in a day of adversity, Straitened is your power,
\v 11 If from delivering those taken to death, And those slipping to the slaughter — you keepest back.
\v 12 When you sayest, 'Lo, we knew not this.' Is not the Ponderer of hearts He who understandeth? And the Keeper of your soul He who knoweth? And He had rendered to man according to his work.
\v 13 Eat my son, honey that is good, And the honeycomb — sweet to your palate.
\v 14 So is the knowledge of wisdom to your soul, If you hast found that there is a posterity And your hope is not cut off.
\v 15 Lay not wait, O wicked one, At the habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting-place.
\v 16 For seven times did the righteous fall and rise, And the wicked stumble in evil.
\v 17 In the falling of yours enemy rejoice not, And in his stumbling let not your heart be joyful,
\v 18 Lest Yahweh see, and it be evil in His eyes, And He had turned from off him His anger.
\v 19 Fret not thyself at evil doers, Be not envious at the wicked,
\v 20 For there is not a posterity to the evil, The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.
\v 21 Fear Yahweh, my son, and the king, With changers mix not up thyself,
\v 22 For suddenly did their calamity rise, And the ruin of them both — who knoweth!
\v 23 These also are for the wise: — To discern faces in judgment is not good.
\v 24 Whoso is saying to the wicked, 'You are righteous,' Peoples execrate him — nations abhor him.
\v 25 And to those reproving it is pleasant, And on them came a good blessing.
\v 26 Lips he kisseth who is returning straightforward words.
\v 27 Prepare in an out-place your work, And make it ready in the field — go afterwards, Then you hast built your house.
\v 28 Be not a witness for nought against your neighbour, Or you hast enticed with your lips.
\v 29 Say not, 'As he did to me, so I do to him, I render to each according to his work.'
\v 30 Near the field of a slothful man I passed by, And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.
\v 31 And behold, it had gone up — all of it — thorns! Covered its face have nettles, And its stone wall had been broken down.
\v 32 And I see — I — I do set my heart, I have seen — I have received instruction,
\v 33 A little sleep — a little slumber — A little folding of the hands to lie down.
\v 34 And your poverty had come as a traveller, And your want as an armed man!
\c 25
\v 1 Also these are Proverbs of Solomon, that men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed: — 
\v 2 The honour of God is to hide a thing, And the honour of kings to search out a matter.
\v 3 The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, And the heart of kings — are unsearchable.
\v 4 Take away dross from silver, And a vessel for the refiner went forth,
\v 5 Take away the wicked before a king, And established in righteousness is his throne.
\v 6 Honour not thyself before a king, And in the place of the great stand not.
\v 7 For better that he had said to you, 'Come you up hither,' Than that he humble you before a noble, Whom yours eyes have seen.
\v 8 Go not forth to strive, haste, turn, What will you in its latter end, When your neighbour caused you to blush?
\v 9 Your cause plead with your neighbour, And the secret counsel of another reveal not,
\v 10 Lest the hearer put you to shame, And yours evil report turn not back.
\v 11 Apples of gold in imagery of silver, Is the word spoken at its fit times.
\v 12 A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure gold, Is the wise reprover to an attentive ear.
\v 13 As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest, So is a faithful ambassador to those sending him, And the soul of his masters he refresheth.
\v 14 Clouds and wind, and rain there is none, Is a man boasting himself in a false gift.
\v 15 By long-suffering is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaketh a bone.
\v 16 Honey you hast found — eat your sufficiency, Lest you be satiated with it, and hast vomited it.
\v 17 Withdraw your foot from your neighbour's house, Lest he be satiated with you, and have hated you.
\v 18 A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, Is the man testifying against his neighbour a false testimony.
\v 19 A bad tooth, and a tottering foot, Is the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity.
\v 20 Whoso is taking away a garment in a cold day, Is as vinegar on nitre, And a singer of songs on a sad heart.
\v 21 If he who is hating you did hunger, cause him to eat bread, And if he thirst, cause him to drink water.
\v 22 For coals you are putting on his head, And Yahweh gave recompense to you.
\v 23 A north wind brought forth rain, And a secret tongue — indignant faces.
\v 24 Better to sit on a corner of a roof, Than with a woman of contentions, and a house of company.
\v 25 As cold waters for a weary soul, So is a good report from a far country.
\v 26 A spring troubled, and a fountain corrupt, Is the righteous falling before the wicked.
\v 27 The eating of much honey is not good, Nor a searching out of one's own honour — honour.
\v 28 A city broken down without walls, Is a man without restraint over his spirit!
\c 26
\v 1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour is not comely for a fool.
\v 2 As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, So reviling without cause did not come.
\v 3 A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an ass, And a rod for the back of fools.
\v 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest you be like to him — even you.
\v 5 Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
\v 6 He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.
\v 7 Weak have been the two legs of the lame, And a parable in the mouth of fools.
\v 8 As one who is binding a stone in a sling, So is he who is giving honour to a fool.
\v 9 A thorn had gone up into the hand of a drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.
\v 10 Great is the Former of all, And He is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.
\v 11 As a dog had returned to its vomit, A fool is repeating his folly.
\v 12 You hast seen a man wise in his own eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!
\v 13 The slothful had said, 'A lion is in the way, A lion is in the broad places.'
\v 14 The door turneth round on its hinge, And the slothful on his bed.
\v 15 The slothful had hid his hand in a dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.
\v 16 Wiser is the slothful in his own eyes, Than seven men returning a reason.
\v 17 Laying hold on the ears of a dog, Is a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.
\v 18 As one pretending to be feeble, Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,
\v 19 So had a man deceived his neighbour, And had said, 'Am not I playing?'
\v 20 Without wood is fire going out, And without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,
\v 21 Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.
\v 22 The words of a tale-bearer are as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down to the inner parts of the heart.
\v 23 Silver of dross spread over potsherd, Are burning lips and an evil heart.
\v 24 By his lips did a hater dissemble, And in his heart he placeth deceit,
\v 25 When his voice is gracious trust not in him, For seven abominations are in his heart.
\v 26 Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed is its wickedness in an assembly.
\v 27 Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.
\v 28 A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!
\c 27
\v 1 Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For you knowest not what a day brought forth.
\v 2 Let another praise you, and not yours own mouth, A stranger, and not yours own lips.
\v 3 A stone is heavy, and the sand is heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.
\v 4 Fury is fierce, and anger is overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?
\v 5 Better is open reproof than hidden love.
\v 6 Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.
\v 7 A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And to a hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
\v 8 As a bird wandering from her nest, So is a man wandering from his place.
\v 9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one's friend — from counsel of the soul.
\v 10 Thine own friend, and the friend of your father, forsake not, And the house of your brother enter not In a day of your calamity, Better is a near neighbour than a brother afar off.
\v 11 Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.
\v 12 The prudent had seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.
\v 13 Take his garment, when a stranger had been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.
\v 14 Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.
\v 15 A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,
\v 16 Whoso is hiding her had hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand called out.
\v 17 Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.
\v 18 The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.
\v 19 As in water the face is to face, So the heart of man to man.
\v 20 Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.
\v 21 A refining pot is for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.
\v 22 If you will beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things — with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.
\v 23 Know well the face of your flock, Set your heart to the droves,
\v 24 For riches are not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.
\v 25 Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.
\v 26 Lambs are for your clothing, And the price of the field are he-goats,
\v 27 And a sufficiency of goats' milk is for your bread, For bread to your house, and life to your damsels!
\c 28
\v 1 The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.
\v 2 By the transgression of a land many are its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right — it is prolonged.
\v 3 A man — poor and oppressing the weak, Is a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.
\v 4 Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.
\v 5 Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Yahweh understand all.
\v 6 Better is the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.
\v 7 Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.
\v 8 Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor did gather it.
\v 9 Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.
\v 10 Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he did fall, And the perfect do inherit good.
\v 11 A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.
\v 12 In the exulting of the righteous the glory is abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.
\v 13 Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking had mercy.
\v 14 O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.
\v 15 A growling lion, and a ranging bear, Is the wicked ruler over a poor people.
\v 16 A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.
\v 17 A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none took hold on him.
\v 18 Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.
\v 19 Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied with bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled with poverty.
\v 20 A stedfast man had multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.
\v 21 To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread did a man transgress.
\v 22 Troubled for wealth is the man with an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want did meet him.
\v 23 Whoso is reproving a man afterwards finds grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.
\v 24 Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, 'It is not transgression,' A companion he is to a destroyer.
\v 25 Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Yahweh is made fat.
\v 26 Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.
\v 27 Whoso is giving to the poor had no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.
\v 28 In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!
\c 29
\v 1 A man often reproved, hardening the neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.
\v 2 In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.
\v 3 A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father, And a friend of harlots destroyeth wealth.
\v 4 A king by judgment establisheth a land, And one receiving gifts throweth it down.
\v 5 A man taking a portion above his neighbour, Spreadeth a net for his own steps.
\v 6 In the transgression of the evil is a snare, And the righteous did sing and rejoice.
\v 7 The righteous knoweth the plea of the poor, The wicked understandeth not knowledge.
\v 8 Men of scorning ensnare a city, And the wise turn back anger.
\v 9 A wise man is judged by the foolish man, And he had been angry, And he had laughed, and there is no rest.
\v 10 Men of blood hate the perfect, And the upright seek his soul.
\v 11 A fool brought out all his mind, And the wise till afterwards restraineth it.
\v 12 A ruler who is attending to lying words, All his ministers are wicked.
\v 13 The poor and the man of frauds have met together, Yahweh is enlightening the eyes of them both.
\v 14 a king that is judging truly the poor, His throne for ever is established.
\v 15 A rod and reproof give wisdom, And a youth let away is shaming his mother.
\v 16 In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplieth, And the righteous on their fall do look.
\v 17 Chastise your son, and he gave you comfort, Yea, he gave delights to your soul.
\v 18 Without a Vision is a people made naked, And whoso is keeping the law, O his happiness!
\v 19 By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, And there is nothing answering.
\v 20 You hast seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him.
\v 21 Whoso is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, At his latter end also he is continuator.
\v 22 An angry man stirreth up contention, And a furious man is multiplying transgression.
\v 23 The pride of man humbleth him, And humility of spirit upholdeth honour.
\v 24 Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, Execration he heareth, and telleth not.
\v 25 Fear of man caused a snare, And the confident in Yahweh is set on high.
\v 26 Many are seeking the face of a ruler, And from Yahweh is the judgment of each.
\v 27 An abomination to the righteous is the perverse man, And an abomination to the wicked is the upright in the way!
\c 30
\v 1 Words of a Gatherer, son of an obedient one, the declaration, an affirmation of the man: — I have wearied myself for God, I have wearied myself for God, and am consumed.
\v 2 For I am more brutish than any one, And have not the understanding of a man.
\v 3 Nor have I learned wisdom, Yet the knowledge of Holy Ones I know.
\v 4 Who went up to heaven, and came down? Who had gathered the wind in his fists? Who had bound waters in a garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What is His name? and what His son's name? Surely you knowest!
\v 5 Every saying of God is tried, A shield He is to those trusting in Him.
\v 6 Add not to His words, lest He reason with you, And you hast been found false.
\v 7 Two things I have asked from Thee, Withhold not from me before I die.
\v 8 Vanity and a lying word put far from me, Poverty or wealth give not to me, Cause me to eat the bread of my portion,
\v 9 Lest I become satiated, and have denied, And have said, 'Who is Yahweh?' And lest I be poor, and have stolen, And have laid hold of the name of my God.
\v 10 Accuse not a servant unto his lord, Lest he disesteem you, and you be found guilty.
\v 11 A generation is, that lightly esteemeth their father, And their mother did not bless.
\v 12 A generation — pure in their own eyes, But from their own filth not washed.
\v 13 A generation — how high are their eyes, Yea, their eyelids are lifted up.
\v 14 A generation — swords are their teeth, And knives — their jaw-teeth, To consume the poor from earth, And the needy from among men.
\v 15 To the leech are two daughters, 'Give, give, Lo, three things are not satisfied, Four have not said 'Sufficiency;'
\v 16 Sheol, and a restrained womb, Earth — it is not satisfied with water, And fire — it had not said, 'Sufficiency,'
\v 17 An eye that mocketh at a father, And despiseth to obey a mother, Dig it out do ravens of the valley, And eat it do young eagles.
\v 18 Three things have been too wonderful for me, Yea, four that I have not known:
\v 19 The way of the eagle in the heavens, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, And the way of a man in youth.
\v 20 So — the way of an adulterous woman, She had eaten and had wiped her mouth, And had said, 'I have not done iniquity.'
\v 21 For three things had earth been troubled, And for four — it is not able to bear:
\v 22 For a servant when he reigneth, And a fool when he is satisfied with bread,
\v 23 For a hated one when she ruleth, And a maid-servant when she succeedeth her mistress.
\v 24 Four are little ones of earth, And they are made wiser than the wise:
\v 25 The ants are a people not strong, And they prepare in summer their food,
\v 26 Conies are a people not strong, And they place in a rock their house,
\v 27 A king there is not to the locust, And it went out — each one shouting,
\v 28 A spider with two hands took hold, And is in the palaces of a king.
\v 29 Three there are going well, Yea, four are good in going:
\v 30 An old lion — mighty among beasts, That turneth not back from the face of any,
\v 31 A girt one of the loins, or a he-goat, And a king — no rising up with him.
\v 32 If you hast been foolish in lifting up thyself, And if you hast devised evil — hand to mouth!
\v 33 For the churning of milk brought out butter, And the wringing of the nose brought out blood, And the forcing of anger brought out strife!
\c 31
\v 1 Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:
\v 2 'What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?
\v 3 Give not to women your strength, And your ways to wiping away of kings.
\v 4 Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.
\v 5 Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.
\v 6 Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter in soul,
\v 7 He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he remembered not again.
\v 8 Open your mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of change.
\v 9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the poor and needy!'
\v 10 A woman of worth who did find? Yea, far above rubies is her price.
\v 11 The heart of her husband had trusted in her, And spoil he lacketh not.
\v 12 She had done him good, and not evil, All days of her life.
\v 13 She had sought wool and flax, And with delight she worketh with her hands.
\v 14 She had been as ships of the merchant, From afar she brought in her bread.
\v 15 Yea, she riseth while yet night, And gave food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.
\v 16 She had considered a field, and took it, From the fruit of her hands she had planted a vineyard.
\v 17 She had girded with might her loins, And did strengthen her arms.
\v 18 She had perceived when her merchandise is good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.
\v 19 Her hands she had sent forth on a spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.
\v 20 Her hand she had spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.
\v 21 She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
\v 22 Ornamental coverings she had made for herself, Silk and purple are her clothing.
\v 23 Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with elders of the land.
\v 24 Linen garments she had made, and selleth, And a girdle she had given to the merchant.
\v 25 Strength and honour are her clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day.
\v 26 Her mouth she had opened in wisdom, And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
\v 27 She is watching the ways of her household, And bread of sloth she eateth not.
\v 28 Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,
\v 29 Many are the daughters who have done worthily, You hast gone up above them all.'
\v 30 The grace is false, and the beauty is vain, A woman fearing Yahweh, she may boast herself.
\v 31 Give you to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!
