\v 1 And it came to pass after the death of Moses, servant of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke unto Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Moses my servant is dead, and now, rise, pass over this Jordan, you, and all this people, unto the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.
\v 3 'Every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth, to you I have given it, as I have spoken unto Moses.
\v 4 From this wilderness and Lebanon, and unto the great river, the river Phrath, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great Sea — the going in of the sun — is your border.
\v 5 'No man did station himself before you all days of your life; as I have been with Moses, I am with you, I do not fail you, nor forsake you;
\v 6 be strong and courageous, for you — you will cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.
\v 7 Only, be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; you will not turn aside from it right or left, so that you will act wisely in every place where you goest;
\v 8 the book of this law did not depart out of your mouth, and you hast meditated in it by day and by night, so that you will observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then you will cause your way to prosper, and then you will act wisely.
\v 9 Have not I commanded you? be strong and courageous; be not terrified nor frightened, for with you is Yahweh your God in every place where you goest.'
\v 10 And Joshua commandeth the authorities of the people, saying,
\v 11 'Pass over into the middle of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provision, for within three days you are passing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you to possess it.'
\v 12 And to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, had Joshua spoken, saying,
\v 13 'Remember the word which Moses, servant of Yahweh, commanded you, saying, Yahweh your God is giving rest to you, and He had given to you this land;
\v 14 your wives, your infants, and your substance, abide in the land which Moses had given to you beyond the Jordan, and you — you pass over by fifties, before your brethren, all the mighty ones of valour, and have helped them,
\v 15 till that Yahweh gave rest to your brethren as to yourselves, and they have possessed, even they, the land which Yahweh your God is giving to them; then you have turned back to the land of your possession, and have possessed it, which Moses, servant of Yahweh, had given to you beyond the Jordan, at the sun-rising.'
\v 16 And they answer Joshua, saying, 'All that you hast commanded us we do; and unto every place where you will send us, we go;
\v 17 according to all that we hearkened unto Moses in, so we hearken unto you; surely Yahweh your God is with you as He had been with Moses.
\v 18 Any man who did provoke your mouth, and did not hear your words, in all that you will command him, is put to death; only, be strong and courageous.'
\c 2
\v 1 And Joshua son of Nun sent from Shittim, two men, spies, silently, saying, 'Go, see the land — and Jericho;' and they go and come into the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name is Rahab, and they lie down there.
\v 2 And it is told to the king of Jericho, saying, 'Lo, men have come in hither to-night, from the sons of Israel, to search the land.
\v 3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, 'Bring out the men who are coming in unto you, who have come into your house, for to search the whole of the land they have come in.
\v 4 And the woman took the two men, and hideth them, and said thus: 'The men came in unto me, and I have not known whence they are;
\v 5 and it came to pass — the gate is to be shut — in the dark, and the men have gone out; I have not known where the men have gone; pursue you, hasten after them, for you overtake them;'
\v 6 and she had caused them to go up on the roof, and hideth them with the flax wood, which is arranged for her on the roof.
\v 7 And the men have pursued after them the way of the Jordan, by the fords, and the gate they have shut afterwards, when the pursuers have gone out after them.
\v 8 And — before they lie down — she had gone up unto them on the roof,
\v 9 and she said unto the men, 'I have known that Yahweh had given to you the land, and that your terror had fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted at your presence.
\v 10 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the waters of the Red Sea at your presence, in your going out of Egypt, and that which you have done to the two kings of the Amorite who are beyond the Jordan; to Sihon and to Og whom you devoted.
\v 11 And we hear, and melt did our heart, and there had not stood any more spirit in any man, from your presence, for Yahweh your God, He is God in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath.
\v 12 And now, swear you, I pray you, to me by Yahweh — because I have done with you kindness — that you have done, even you, kindness with the house of my father, and have given to me a true token,
\v 13 and have kept alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and have delivered our souls from death.'
\v 14 And the men say to her, 'Our soul for yours — to die; if you declare not this our matter, then it had been, in Yahweh's giving to us this land, that we have done with you kindness and truth.'
\v 15 And she caused them to go down by a rope through the window, for her house is in the side of the wall, and in the wall she is dwelling;
\v 16 and she said to them, 'To the mountain go, lest the pursuers come upon you; and you have been hidden there three days till the turning back of the pursuers, and afterwards you go on your way.'
\v 17 And the men say unto her, 'We are acquitted of this yours oath which you hast caused us to swear:
\v 18 behold, we are coming into the land, this line of scarlet thread you will bind to the window by which you hast caused us to go down, and your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all the house of your father you will gather unto you, to the house;
\v 19 and it had been, any one who went out from the doors of your house without, his blood is on his head, and we are innocent; and any one who is with you in the house, his blood is on our head, if a hand is on him;
\v 20 and if you declare this our matter, then we have been acquitted from yours oath which you hast caused us to swear.'
\v 21 And she said, 'According unto your words, so it is;' and she sent them away, and they go; and she bindeth the scarlet line to the window.
\v 22 And they go, and come in to the mountain, and abide there three days until the pursuers have turned back; and the pursuers seek in all the way, and have not found.
\v 23 And the two men turn back, and come down from the hill, and pass over, and come in unto Joshua son of Nun, and recount to him all that had come upon them;
\v 24 and they say unto Joshua, 'Surely Yahweh had given into our hand all the land; and also, all the inhabitants of the land have melted at our presence.'
\c 3
\v 1 And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and they journey from Shittim, and come in unto the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and they lodge there before they pass over.
\v 2 And it came to pass, at the end of three days, that the authorities pass over into the middle of the camp,
\v 3 and command the people, saying, 'When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you journey from your place, and have gone after it;
\v 4 only, a distance is between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; you do not come near unto it, so that you know the way in which you go, for you have not passed over in the way heretofore.'
\v 5 And Joshua said unto the people, 'Sanctify yourselves, for to-morrow did Yahweh do in your middle wonders.'
\v 6 And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying, 'Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people;' and they take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people.
\v 7 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'This day I begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel, so that they know that as I was with Moses I am with you;
\v 8 and you, you will command the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come unto the extremity of the waters of the Jordan — in the Jordan you stand.'
\v 9 And Joshua said unto the sons of Israel, 'Come nigh hither, and hear the words of Yahweh your God;
\v 10 and Joshua said, 'By this you know that the living God is in your middle, and He did certainly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite:
\v 11 behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is passing over before you into Jordan;
\v 12 and now, take for you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man — one man for a tribe;
\v 13 and it had been, at the resting of the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth, in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan are cut off — the waters which are coming down from above — and they stand — one heap.'
\v 14 And it came to pass, in the journeying of the people from their tents to pass over the Jordan, and of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,
\v 15 and at those bearing the ark coming in unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark have been dipped in the extremity of the waters (and the Jordan is full over all its banks all the days of harvest) — 
\v 16 that the waters stand; those coming down from above have risen — one heap, very far above Adam the city, which is at the side of Zaretan; and those going down by the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, have been completely cut off; and the people have passed through over-against Jericho;
\v 17 and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stand on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan — established, and all Israel are passing over on dry ground till that all the nation had completed to pass over the Jordan.
\c 4
\v 1 And it came to pass, when all the nation had completed to pass over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke unto Joshua, saying,
\v 2 Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man — one man out of a tribe;
\v 3 and command you them, saying, Take up for you from this place, from the middle of the Jordan, from the established standing-place of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and you have removed them over with you, and placed them in the lodging-place in which you lodge to-night.'
\v 4 And Joshua called unto the twelve men whom he prepared out of the sons of Israel, one man — one man out of a tribe;
\v 5 and Joshua said to them, 'Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your God unto the middle of the Jordan and lift up for you each, one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
\v 6 so that this is a sign in your middle, when your children ask hereafter, saying, What are these stones to you?
\v 7 that you have said to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off, at the presence of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; in its passing over into the Jordan were the waters of the Jordan cut off; and these stones have been for a memorial to the sons of Israel — to the age.'
\v 8 And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded, and take up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh had spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and remove them over with them unto the lodging-place, and place them there,
\v 9 even the twelve stones had Joshua raised up out of the middle of the Jordan, the place of the standing of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, and they are there unto this day.
\v 10 And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the middle of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua, and the people haste and pass over.
\v 11 And it came to pass when all the people have completed to pass over, that the ark of Yahweh passeth over, and the priests, in the presence of the people;
\v 12 and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, pass over, by fifties, before the sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them;
\v 13 about forty thousand, armed ones of the host, passed over before Yahweh for battle, unto the plains of Jericho.
\v 14 On that day had Yahweh made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they reverence him, as they reverenced Moses, all days of his life.
\v 15 And Yahweh spoke unto Joshua, saying,
\v 16 'Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony, and they come up out of the Jordan.'
\v 17 And Joshua commandeth the priests, saying, 'Come you up out of the Jordan.'
\v 18 And it came to pass, in the coming up of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the middle of the Jordan — the soles of the feet of the priests have been drawn up into the dry ground — and the waters of the Jordan turn back to their place, and go as heretofore over all its banks.
\v 19 And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity east of Jericho;
\v 20 and these twelve stones, which they have taken out of the Jordan, had Joshua raised up in Gilgal.
\v 21 And he spoke unto the sons of Israel, saying, 'When your sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What are these stones?
\v 22 then you have caused your sons to know, saying, On dry land Israel passed over this Jordan;
\v 23 because Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan at your presence, till your passing over, as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up at our presence till our passing over;
\v 24 so that all the people of the land do know the hand of Yahweh that it is strong, so that you have reverenced Yahweh your God all the days.'
\c 5
\v 1 And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorite which are beyond the Jordan, towards the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanite which are by the sea, hear how that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan at the presence of the sons of Israel till their passing over, that their heart is melted, and there had not been in them any more spirit because of the presence of the sons of Israel.
\v 2 At that time said Yahweh unto Joshua, 'Make for you knives of flint, and turn back, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time;'
\v 3 and Joshua made for him knives of flint, and circumciseth the sons of Israel at the height of the foreskins.
\v 4 And this is the thing for which Joshua circumciseth them: all the people who are coming out of Egypt, who are males, all the men of war have died in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out of Egypt,
\v 5 for all the people who are coming out were circumcised, and all the people who are born in the wilderness, in the way, in their coming out from Egypt, they have not circumcised;
\v 6 for forty years have the sons of Israel gone in the wilderness, till all the nation of the men of war who are coming out of Egypt, who hearkened not to the voice of Yahweh, to whom Yahweh had sworn not to show them the land which Yahweh sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey, are consumed;
\v 7 and their sons He raised up in their stead, them had Joshua circumcised, for they have been uncircumcised, for they have not circumcised them in the way.
\v 8 And it came to pass when all the nation have completed to be circumcised, that they abide in their places in the camp till their recovering;
\v 9 and Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'To-day I have rolled the reproach of Egypt from off you;' and one called the name of that place Gilgal unto this day.
\v 10 And the sons of Israel encamp in Gilgal, and make the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho;
\v 11 and they eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow of the passover, unleavened things and roasted corn, in this self-same day;
\v 12 and the manna did cease on the morrow in their eating of the old corn of the land, and there had been no more manna to the sons of Israel, and they eat of the increase of the land of Canaan in that year.
\v 13 And it came to pass in Joshua's being by Jericho, that he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and behold, one standing over-against him, and his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua went unto him, and said to him, 'Art you for us or for our adversaries?'
\v 14 And He said, 'No, for I am Prince of Yahweh's host; now I have come;' and Joshua falleth on his face to the earth, and did obeisance, and said to Him, 'What is my Lord speaking unto His servant?'
\v 15 And the Prince of Yahweh's host said unto Joshua, 'Cast off your shoe from off your foot, for the place on which you are standing is holy;' and Joshua did so;
\c 6
\v 1 (And Jericho shutteth itself up, and is shut up, because of the presence of the sons of Israel — none going out, and none coming in;)
\v 2 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'See, I have given into your hand Jericho and its king — mighty ones of valour,
\v 3 and you have compassed the city — all the men of battle — going round the city once; thus you will six days;
\v 4 and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark, and on the seventh day you compass the city seven times, and the priests blow with the trumpets,
\v 5 and it had been, in the prolongation of the horn of the jubilee, in your hearing the voice of the trumpet, all the people shout — a great shout, and the wall of the city had fallen under it, and the people have gone up, each over-against him.'
\v 6 And Joshua son of Nun called unto the priests, and said unto them, 'Bear you the ark of the covenant, and seven priests do bear seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Yahweh;'
\v 7 and He said unto the people, 'Pass over, and compass the city, and he who is armed did pass over before the ark of Yahweh.'
\v 8 And it came to pass, when Joshua spoke unto the people, that the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before Yahweh have passed over and blown with the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is going after them;
\v 9 and he who is armed is going before the priests blowing the trumpets, and he who is gathering up is going after the ark, going on and blowing with the trumpets;
\v 10 and the people had Joshua commanded, saying, 'Ye do not shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor did there go out from your mouth a word, till the day of my saying unto you, Shout you — then you have shouted.'
\v 11 And the ark of Yahweh did compass the city, going round once, and they come into the camp, and lodge in the camp.
\v 12 And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and the priests bear the ark of Yahweh,
\v 13 and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the jubilee before the ark of Yahweh are walking, going on, and they have blown with the trumpets — and he who is armed is going before them, and he who is gathering up is going behind the ark of Yahweh — going on and blowing with the trumpets.
\v 14 And they compass the city on the second day once, and turn back to the camp; thus they have done six days.
\v 15 And it came to pass, on the seventh day, that they rise early, at the ascending of the dawn, and compass the city, according to this manner, seven times; (only, on that day they have compassed the city seven times);
\v 16 and it came to pass, at the seventh time, the priests have blown with the trumpets, and Joshua said unto the people, 'Shout you, for Yahweh had given to you the city;
\v 17 and the city had been devoted, it and all that is in it, to Yahweh; only Rahab the harlot did live, she and all who are with her in the house, for she hid the messengers whom we sent;
\v 18 and surely you have kept from the devoted thing, lest you devote yourselves, and have taken from the devoted thing, and have made the camp of Israel become a devoted thing, and have troubled it;
\v 19 and all the silver and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, holy they are to Yahweh; into the treasury of Yahweh they come.'
\v 20 And the people shout, and blow with the trumpets, and it came to pass when the people hear the voice of the trumpet, that the people shout — a great shout, and the wall falleth under it, and the people went up into the city, each over-against him, and they capture the city;
\v 21 and they devote all that is in the city, from man even unto woman, from young even unto aged, even unto ox, and sheep, and ass, by the mouth of the sword.
\v 22 And to the two men who are spying the land Joshua said, 'Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out there the woman, and all whom she had, as you have sworn to her.'
\v 23 And the young man, the spies, go in and bring out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all whom she had; yea, all her families they have brought out, and place them at the outside of the camp of Israel.
\v 24 And the city they have burnt with fire, and all that is in it; only, the silver and the gold, and the vessels of brass, and of iron, they have given to the treasury of the house of Yahweh;
\v 25 and Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and all whom she had, had Joshua kept alive; and she dwelleth in the middle of Israel unto this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
\v 26 And Joshua adjureth them at that time, saying, 'Cursed is the man before Yahweh who raiseth up and had built this city, even Jericho; in his first-born he did lay its foundation, and in his youngest he did set up its doors;'
\v 27 and Yahweh is with Joshua, and his fame is in all the land.
\c 7
\v 1 And the sons of Israel commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing, and the anger of Yahweh burneth against the sons of Israel.
\v 2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-Aven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, 'Go up and spy the land;' and the men go up and spy Ai,
\v 3 and they turn back unto Joshua, and say unto him, 'Let not all the people go up; let about two thousand men, or about three thousand men, go up, and they smite Ai; cause not all the people to labour thither; for they are few.'
\v 4 And there go up of the people thither about three thousand men, and they flee before the men of Ai,
\v 5 and the men of Ai smite of them about thirty and six men, and pursue them before the gate unto Shebarim, and they smite them in Morad; and the heart of the people is melted, and became water.
\v 6 And Joshua rendeth his garments, and falleth on his face to the earth before the ark of Yahweh till the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they cause dust to go up on their head.
\v 7 And Joshua said, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, why hast You at all caused this people to pass over the Jordan, to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us? — and oh that we had been willing — and we dwell beyond the Jordan!
\v 8 Oh, Lord, what do I say, after that Israel had turned the neck before its enemies?
\v 9 and the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land do hear, and have come round against us, and cut off our name out of the earth; and what will You do for Your great name?'
\v 10 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'Rise for you, why is this? — you are falling on your face?
\v 11 Israel had sinned, and also they have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them, and also taken of the devoted thing, and also stolen, and also deceived, and also put it among their vessels,
\v 12 and the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before their enemies; the neck they turn before their enemies, for they have become a devoted thing; I add not to be with you — if you destroy not the devoted thing out of your middle.
\v 13 Rise, sanctify the people, and you hast said, Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow; for thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, A devoted thing is in your middle, O Israel, you are not able to stand before yours enemies till your turning aside of the devoted thing out of your middle;
\v 14 and you have been brought near in the morning by your tribes, and it had been, the tribe which Yahweh did capture did draw near by families, and the family which Yahweh did capture did draw near by households, and the household which Yahweh did capture did draw near by men;
\v 15 and it had been, he who is captured with the devoted thing is burnt with fire, he and all that he had, because he had transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he had done folly in Israel.'
\v 16 And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and brought Israel near by its tribes, and the tribe of Judah is captured;
\v 17 and he brought near the family of Judah, and he captureth the family of the Zarhite; and he brought near the family of the Zarhite by men, and Zabdi is captured;
\v 18 and he brought near his household by men, and Achan — son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah — is captured.
\v 19 And Joshua said unto Achan, 'My son, put, I pray you, honour on Yahweh, God of Israel, and give to Him thanks, and declare, I pray you, to me, what you hast done — hide not from me.'
\v 20 And Achan answereth Joshua, and said, 'Truly I have sinned against Yahweh, God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done;
\v 21 and I see among the spoil a goodly robe of Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and one wedge of gold, whose weight is fifty shekels, and I desire them, and take them; and behold, they are hid in the earth, in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.'
\v 22 And Joshua sent messengers, and they run unto the tent, and behold, it is hidden in his tent, and the silver under it;
\v 23 and they take them out of the middle of the tent, and bring them in unto Joshua, and unto all the sons of Israel, and pour them out before Yahweh.
\v 24 And Joshua took Achan son of Zerah, and the silver, and the robe, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his flock, and his tent, and all that he had, and all Israel with him, and they cause them to go up the valley of Achor.
\v 25 And Joshua said, 'What! you hast troubled us! — Yahweh did trouble you this day;' and all Israel cast stones at him, and they burn them with fire, and they stone them with stones,
\v 26 and they raise up over him a great heap of stones unto this day, and Yahweh turneth back from the heat of His anger, therefore had one called the name of that place 'Valley of Achor' till this day.
\c 8
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'Fear not, nor be frightened, take with you all the people of war, and rise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land,
\v 2 and you hast done to Ai and to her king as you hast done to Jericho and to her king; only, its spoil and its cattle you spoil for yourselves; set for you an ambush for the city at its rear.'
\v 3 And Joshua riseth, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai, and Joshua chooseth thirty thousand men, mighty ones of valour, and sent them away by night,
\v 4 and commandeth them, saying, 'See, you are liers in wait against the city, at the rear of the city, you go not very far off from the city, and all of you have been prepared,
\v 5 and I and all the people who are with me draw near unto the city, and it had come to pass when they come out to meet us as at the first, and we have fled before them,
\v 6 and they have come out after us till we have drawn them out of the city, for they say, They are fleeing before us as at the first, and we have fled before them,
\v 7 and you rise from the ambush, and have occupied the city, and Yahweh your God had given it into your hand;
\v 8 and it had been, when you capture the city, you burn the city with fire, according to the word of Yahweh you do, see, I have commanded you.'
\v 9 And Joshua sent them away, and they go unto the ambush, and abide between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai; and Joshua lodgeth on that night in the middle of the people.
\v 10 And Joshua riseth early in the morning, and inspecteth the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai;
\v 11 and all the people of war who are with him have gone up, and draw nigh and come in over-against the city, and encamp on the north of Ai; and the valley is between him and Ai.
\v 12 And he took about five thousand men, and setteth them an ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city;
\v 13 and they set the people, all the camp which is on the north of the city, and its rear on the west of the city, and Joshua went on that night into the middle of the valley.
\v 14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that hasten, and rise early, and go out do the men of the city to meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at the appointed season, at the front of the plain, and he had not known that an ambush is against him, on the rear of the city.
\v 15 And Joshua and all Israel seem stricken before them, and flee the way of the wilderness,
\v 16 and all the people who are in the city are called to pursue after them, and they pursue after Joshua, and are drawn away out of the city,
\v 17 and there had not been left a man in Ai and Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they leave the city open, and pursue after Israel.
\v 18 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'Stretch out with the javelin which is in your hand towards Ai, for into your hand I give it;' and Joshua stretcheth out with the javelin which is in his hand toward the city,
\v 19 and the ambush had risen with haste, out of its place, and they run at the stretching out of his hand, and go into the city, and capture it, and hasten, and burn the city with fire.
\v 20 And the men of Ai look behind them, and see, and behold, the smoke of the city had gone up unto the heavens, and there had not been in them power to flee hither and thither — and the people who are fleeing to the wilderness have turned against the pursuer, — 
\v 21 and Joshua and all Israel have seen that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city had gone up, and they turn back and smite the men of Ai;
\v 22 and these have come out from the city to meet them, and they are in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that, and they smite them till he had not left to them a remnant and escaped one;
\v 23 and the king of Ai they caught alive, and bring him near unto Joshua.
\v 24 And it came to pass, at Israel's finishing to slay all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them (and they fall all of them by the mouth of the sword till their consumption), that all Israel turn back to Ai, and smite it by the mouth of the sword;
\v 25 and all who fall during the day, of men and of women, are twelve thousand — all men of Ai.
\v 26 And Joshua had not brought back his hand which he stretched out with the javelin till that he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai;
\v 27 only, the cattle and the spoil of that city have Israel spoiled for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh which He commanded Joshua.
\v 28 And Joshua burneth Ai, and made it a heap age-during — a desolation unto this day;
\v 29 and the king of Ai he had hanged on the tree till even-time, and at the going in of the sun had Joshua commanded, and they take down his carcase from the tree, and cast it unto the opening of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones till this day.
\v 30 Then did Joshua build an altar to Yahweh, God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
\v 31 as Moses, servant of Yahweh, commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses — an altar of whole stones, over which he had not waved iron — and they cause to go up upon it burnt-offerings to Yahweh, and sacrifice peace-offerings;
\v 32 and he writeth there on the stones the copy of the law of Moses, which he had written in the presence of the sons of Israel.
\v 33 And all Israel, and its elders, and authorities, and its judges, are standing on this side and on that of the ark, over-against the priests, the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, as well the sojourner as the native, half of them over-against mount Gerizim, and the half of them over-against mount Ebal, as Moses servant of Yahweh commanded to bless the people of Israel at the first.
\v 34 And afterwards he had proclaimed all the words of the law, the blessing and the reviling, according to all that is written in the book of the law;
\v 35 there had not been a thing of all that Moses commanded which Joshua had not proclaimed before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the infants, and the sojourner who is going in their middle.
\c 9
\v 1 And it came to pass, when all the kings who are beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the low-country, and in every haven of the great sea, over-against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, hear — 
\v 2 that they gather themselves together to fight with Joshua, and with Israel — one mouth.
\v 3 And the inhabitants of Gibeon have heard that which Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\v 4 and they work, even they, with subtilty, and go, and feign to be ambassadors, and take old sacks for their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up,
\v 5 and sandals, old and patched, on their feet, and old garments upon them, and all the bread of their provision is dry — it was crumbs.
\v 6 And they go unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, and say unto him, and unto the men of Israel, 'From a land far off we have come, and now, make with us a covenant;'
\v 7 and the men of Israel say unto the Hivite, 'It may be in our middle you are dwelling, and how do we make with you a covenant?'
\v 8 and they say unto Joshua, 'Your servants we are.' And Joshua said unto them, 'Who are you? and whence come you?'
\v 9 And they say unto him, 'From a land very far off have your servants come, for the name of Yahweh your God, for we have heard His fame, and all that He had done in Egypt,
\v 10 and all that He had done to the two kings of the Amorite who are beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who is in Ashtaroth.
\v 11 And our elders, and all the inhabitants of our land speak unto us, saying, Take in your hand provision for the way, and go to meet them, and you have said unto them, Your servants we are, and now, make with us a covenant;
\v 12 this our bread — hot we provided ourselves with it out of our houses, on the day of our coming out to go unto you, and now, behold, it is dry, and had been crumbs;
\v 13 and these are the wine-bottles which we filled, new, and behold, they have rent; and these, our garments and our sandals, have become old, from the exceeding greatness of the way.'
\v 14 And the men take of their provision, and the mouth of Yahweh have not asked;
\v 15 and Joshua made with them peace, and made with them a covenant, to keep them alive; and swear to them do the princes of the company.
\v 16 And it came to pass, at the end of three days after that they have made with them a covenant, that they hear that they are their neighbours — that in their middle they are dwelling.
\v 17 And the sons of Israel journey and come in unto their cities on the third day — and their cities are Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-Jearim — 
\v 18 and the sons of Israel have not smitten them, for sworn to them have the princes of the company by Yahweh God of Israel, and all the company murmur against the princes.
\v 19 And all the princes say unto all the company, 'We — we have sworn to them by Yahweh, God of Israel; and now, we are not able to come against them;
\v 20 this we do to them, and have kept them alive, and wrath is not upon us, because of the oath which we have sworn to them.'
\v 21 And the princes say unto them, 'They live, and are hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the company, as the princes spake to them.'
\v 22 And Joshua called for them, and spoke unto them, saying, 'Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, and you in our middle dwelling?
\v 23 and now, cursed are you, and none of you is cut off from being a servant, even hewers of wood and drawers of water, for the house of my God.'
\v 24 And they answer Joshua and say, 'Because it was certainly declared to your servants, that Yahweh your God commanded Moses His servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; and we fear greatly for ourselves because of you, and we do this thing;
\v 25 and now, behold, we are in your hand, as it is good, and as it is right in yours eyes to do to us — do.'
\v 26 And he did to them so, and delivereth them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they have not killed them;
\v 27 and Joshua made them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the company, and for the altar of Yahweh, unto this day, at the place which He did choose.
\c 10
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heareth that Joshua had captured Ai, and did devote it (as he had done to Jericho and to her king so he had done to Ai and to her king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon have made peace with Israel, and are in their middle, — 
\v 2 that they are greatly afraid, because Gibeon is a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it is greater than Ai, and all its men — heroes.
\v 3 And Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\v 4 'Come up unto me, and help me, and we smite Gibeon, for it had made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.'
\v 5 And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it.
\v 6 And the men of Gibeon send unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, saying, 'Let not your hand cease from your servants; come up unto us with haste, and give safety to us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorite, dwelling in the hill-country, have been assembled against us.'
\v 7 And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, even all the mighty men of valour.
\v 8 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'Be not afraid of them, for into your hand I have given them, there did not stand a man of them in your presence.'
\v 9 And Joshua came in unto them suddenly (all the night he had gone up from Gilgal),
\v 10 and Yahweh did crush them before Israel, and it smiteth them — a great smiting — at Gibeon, and pursueth them the way of the ascent of Beth-Horon, and smiteth them unto Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
\v 11 And it came to pass, in their fleeing from the face of Israel — they are in the descent of Beth-Horon — and Yahweh had cast upon them great stones out of the heavens, unto Azekah, and they die; more are they who have died by the hailstones than they whom the sons of Israel have killed by the sword.
\v 12 Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day of Yahweh's giving up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said, before the eyes of Israel, 'Sun — in Gibeon stand still; and moon — in the valley of Ajalon;'
\v 13 and the sun standeth still, and the moon had stood — till the nation took vengeance on its enemies; is it not written on the Book of the Upright, 'and the sun standeth in the middle of the heavens, and had not hasted to go in — as a perfect day?'
\v 14 And there had not been like that day before it or after it, for Yahweh's hearkening to the voice of a man; for Yahweh is fighting for Israel.
\v 15 And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal.
\v 16 And these five kings flee, and are hidden in a cave at Makkedah,
\v 17 and it is declared to Joshua, saying, 'The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.'
\v 18 And Joshua said, 'Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and appoint over it men to watch them;
\v 19 and you, stand not, pursue after your enemies, and you have smitten the hindmost of them; suffer them not to go in unto their cities, for Yahweh your God had given them into your hand.'
\v 20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel finish to smite them — a very great smiting, till they are consumed, and the remnant who have remained of them go in unto the fenced cities,
\v 21 that all the people turn back to the camp, unto Joshua, at Makkedah, in peace; none moved sharply his tongue against the sons of Israel.
\v 22 And Joshua said, 'Open you the mouth of the cave, and bring out unto me these five kings from the cave;'
\v 23 and they do so, and bring out unto him these five kings from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
\v 24 And it came to pass, when they bring out these kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called unto every man of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war, who have gone with him, 'Draw near, set your feet on the necks of these kings;' and they draw near, and set their feet on their necks.
\v 25 And Joshua said unto them, 'Fear not, nor be frightened; be strong and courageous; for thus did Yahweh do to all your enemies with whom you are fighting;'
\v 26 and Joshua smiteth them afterwards, and putteth them to death, and hangeth them on five trees; and they are hanging on the trees till the evening.
\v 27 And it came to pass, at the time of the going in of the sun, Joshua had commanded, and they take them down from off the trees, and cast them unto the cave where they had been hid, and put great stones on the mouth of the cave till this very day.
\v 28 And Makkedah had Joshua captured on that day, and he smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and its king he had devoted, them and every person who is in it — he had not left a remnant; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
\v 29 And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and fighteth with Libnah;
\v 30 and Yahweh gave also it into the hand of Israel, and its king, and it smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who is in it — it left not in it a remnant; and it did to its king as it did to the king of Jericho.
\v 31 And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and encampeth against it, and fighteth against it;
\v 32 And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and it captureth it on the second day, and smiteth it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who is in it, according to all that it did to Libnah.
\v 33 Than had Horam king of Gezer come up to help Lachish, and Joshua smiteth him and his people, till he had not left to him a remnant.
\v 34 And Joshua passeth over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and they encamp against it, and fight against it,
\v 35 and capture it on that day, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and every person who is in it on that day he had devoted, according to all that he did to Lachish.
\v 36 And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and they fight against it,
\v 37 and capture it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and every person who is in it — he had not left a remnant — according to all that he did to Eglon — and did devote it, and every person who is in it.
\v 38 And Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fighteth against it,
\v 39 and captureth it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smite them by the mouth of the sword, and devote every person who is in it — he had not left a remnant; as he did to Hebron so he did to Debir, and to its king, and as he did to Libnah, and to its king.
\v 40 And Joshua smiteth all the land of the hill-country, and of the south, and of the low-country, and of the springs, and all their kings — he had not left a remnant, and all that did breathe he had devoted, as Yahweh, God of Israel, commanded.
\v 41 And Joshua smiteth them from Kadesh-Barnea, even unto Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even unto Gibeon;
\v 42 and all these kings and their land had Joshua captured at one time, for Yahweh, God of Israel, is fighting for Israel.
\v 43 and Joshua turneth back, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal.
\c 11
\v 1 And it came to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heareth, that he sent unto Jobab king of Madon, and unto the king of Shimron, and unto the king of Achshaph,
\v 2 and unto the kings who are on the north in the hill-country, and in the plain south of Chinneroth, and in the low country, and in the elevations of Dor, on the west,
\v 3 to the Canaanite on the east, and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon, in the land of Mizpeh — 
\v 4 and they go out, they and all their camps with them, a people numerous, as the sand which is on the sea-shore for multitude, and horse and charioteer very many;
\v 5 and all these kings are met together, and they come and encamp together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
\v 6 And Yahweh said unto Joshua, 'Be not afraid of their presence, for to-morrow about this time I am giving all of them wounded before Israel; their horses you will hough, and their chariots burn with fire.'
\v 7 And Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fall on them;
\v 8 and Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, and they smite them and pursue them unto the great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-Maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward, and they smite them, till he had not left to them a remnant;
\v 9 and Joshua did to them as Yahweh said to him; their horses he had houghed, and their chariots burnt with fire.
\v 10 And Joshua turneth back at that time, and captureth Hazor, and its king he had smitten by the sword; for Hazor formerly is head of all these kingdoms;
\v 11 and they smite every person who is in it by the mouth of the sword; he had devoted — he had not left any one breathing, and Hazor he had burnt with fire;
\v 12 and all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, had Joshua captured, and he smiteth them by the mouth of the sword; he devoted them, as Moses, servant of Yahweh, commanded.
\v 13 Only, all the cities which are standing by their hill, Israel had not burned them, save Hazor only, it had Joshua burnt;
\v 14 and all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, have the sons of Israel spoiled for themselves; only, every human being they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, till their destroying them; they have not left any one breathing.
\v 15 As Yahweh commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so had Joshua done; he had not turned aside a thing of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 16 And Joshua took all this land: the hill-country, and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and the plain, even the hill-country of Israel and its low lands,
\v 17 from the mount of Halak, which is going up to Seir, and unto Baal-Gad, in the valley of Lebanon, under mount Hermon; and all their kings he had captured, and he smiteth them, and putteth them to death.
\v 18 Many days had Joshua made with all these kings war;
\v 19 there had not been a city which made peace with the sons of Israel save the Hivite, inhabitants of Gibeon; the whole they have taken in battle;
\v 20 for from Yahweh it had been to strengthen their heart, to meet in battle with Israel, in order to devote them, so that they have no grace, but in order to destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 21 And Joshua came at that time, and cutteth off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, even from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel; with their cities had Joshua devoted them.
\v 22 There had not been left Anakim in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, were they left.
\v 23 And Joshua took the whole of the land, according to all that Yahweh had spoken unto Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions, by their tribes; and the land had rest from war.
\c 12
\v 1 And these are kings of the land whom the sons of Israel have smitten, and possess their land, beyond the Jordan, at the sun-rising, from the brook Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain eastward.
\v 2 Sihon, king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in Heshbon, ruling from Aroer which is on the border of the brook Arnon, and the middle of the brook, and half of Gilead, and unto Jabok the brook, the border of the Bene-Ammon;
\v 3 And the plain unto the sea of Chinneroth eastward, and unto the sea of the plain (the salt sea) eastward, the way to Beth-Jeshimoth, and from the south under the springs of Pisgah.
\v 4 And the border of Og king of Bashan (of the remnant of the Rephaim), who is dwelling in Ashtaroth and in Edrei,
\v 5 and ruling in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurite, and the Maachadite, and the half of Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
\v 6 Moses, servant of Yahweh, and the sons of Israel have smitten them, and Moses, servant of Yahweh, gave it — a possession to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\v 7 And these are kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel have smitten beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-Gad, in the valley of Lebanon, and unto the mount of Halak, which is going up to Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel — a possession according to their divisions;
\v 8 in the hill-country, and in the low country, and in the plain, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
\v 9 The king of Jericho, one; The king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
\v 10 The king of Jerusalem, one; The king of Hebron, one;
\v 11 The king of Jarmuth, one; The king of Lachish, one;
\v 12 The king of Eglon, one; The king of Gezer, one;
\v 13 The king of Debir, one; The king of Geder, one;
\v 14 The king of Hormah, one; The king of Arad, one;
\v 15 The king of Libnah, one; The king of Adullam, one;
\v 16 The king of Mekkedah, one; The king of Beth-El, one;
\v 17 The king of Tappuah, one; The king of Hepher, one;
\v 18 The king of Aphek, one; The king of Lasharon, one;
\v 19 The king of Madon, one; The king of Hazor, one;
\v 20 The king of Shimron-Meron, one; The king of Achshaph, one;
\v 21 The king of Taanach, one; The king of Megiddo, one;
\v 22 The king of Kedesh, one; The king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;
\v 23 The king of Dor, at the elevation of Dor, one; The king of the Goyim of Gilgal, one;
\v 24 The king of Tirzah, one; all the kings are thirty and one.
\c 13
\v 1 And Joshua is old, entering into days, and Yahweh said unto him, 'You hast become aged, you hast entered into days; as to the land, very much had been left to possess.
\v 2 This is the land that is left; all the circuits of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
\v 3 from Sihor which is on the front of Egypt, and unto the border of Ekron northward, to the Canaanite it is reckoned, five princes of the Philistines, the Gazathite, and the Ashdothite, the Eshkalonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite, also the Avim.
\v 4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah, which is to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, unto the border of the Amorite;
\v 5 and the land of the Giblite, and all Lebanon, at the sun-rising, from Baal-Gad under mount Hermon, unto the going in to Hamath:
\v 6 all the inhabitants of the hill-country, from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-Maim, all the Sidonians: I — I dispossess them before the sons of Israel; only, cause it to fall to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
\v 7 And now, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh,' — 
\v 8 with it the Reubenite, and the Gadite, have received their inheritance, which Moses had given to them beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses servant of Yahweh had given to them;
\v 9 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the brook Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the brook, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dihon,
\v 10 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorite, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the Bene-Ammon,
\v 11 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurite, and of the Maachadite, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;
\v 12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei; he was left of the remnant of the Rephaim, and Moses did smite them, and dispossess them;
\v 13 and the sons of Israel dispossessed not the Geshurite, and the Maachadite; and Geshur and Maachad dwell in the middle of Israel unto this day.
\v 14 Only, to the tribe of Levi he had not given an inheritance; fire-offerings of Yahweh, God of Israel, is its inheritance, as He had spoken to it.
\v 15 And Moses gave to the tribe of the sons of Reuben, for their families;
\v 16 and the border is to them from Aroer, which is on the edge of the brook Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the brook, and all the plain by Medeba,
\v 17 Heshbon, and all its cities which are in the plain, Dibon, and Bamoth-Baal, and Beth-Baal-Meon,
\v 18 and Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
\v 19 and Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-Shahar, in the mount of the valley,
\v 20 and Beth-Peor, and the springs of Pisgah, and Beth-Jeshimoth,
\v 21 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorite, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote, with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, princes of Sihon, inhabitants of the land.
\v 22 And Balaam, son of Beor, the diviner, have the sons of Israel killed with the sword, among their wounded ones.
\v 23 And the border of the sons of Reuben is the Jordan, and its border; this is the inheritance of the sons of Reuben, for their families, the cities and their villages.
\v 24 And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, for their families;
\v 25 and the border is to them Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and the half of the land of the Bene-Ammon, unto Aroer which is on the front of Rabbah,
\v 26 and from Heshbon unto Ramath-Mispeh, and Betonim, and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir,
\v 27 and in the valley, Beth-Aram, and Beth-Nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and its border, unto the extremity of the sea of Chinnereth, beyond the Jordan, eastward.
\v 28 This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad, for their families, the cities and their villages.
\v 29 And Moses gave to the half of the tribe of Manasseh; and it is to the half of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, for their families.
\v 30 And their border is from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the small towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;
\v 31 and the half of Gilead, and Ashteroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, are to the sons of Machir, son of Manasseh, to the half of the sons of Machir, for their families.
\v 32 These are they whom Moses caused to inherit in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, by Jericho, eastward;
\v 33 and to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not an inheritance; Yahweh, God of Israel, Himself is their inheritance, as He had spoken to them.
\c 14
\v 1 And these are they of the sons of Israel who inherited in the land of Canaan, whom Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel, caused to inherit;
\v 2 by lot is their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine of the tribes, and the half of the tribe;
\v 3 for Moses had given the inheritance of two of the tribes, and of half of the tribe, beyond the Jordan, and to the Levites he had not given an inheritance in their middle;
\v 4 for the sons of Joseph had been two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they have not given a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, and their suburbs for their cattle, and for their possessions;
\v 5 as Yahweh commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done, and they apportion the land.
\v 6 And the sons of Judah come nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite said unto him, 'You hast known the word that Yahweh had spoken unto Moses the man of God, concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh-Barnea:
\v 7 a son of forty years am I in Moses, servant of Yahweh, sending me from Kadesh-Barnea, to spy the land, and I bring him back word as with my heart;
\v 8 and my brethren who have gone up with me have caused the heart of the people to melt, and I have been fully after Yahweh my God;
\v 9 and Moses sweareth in that day, saying, If not — the land on which your foot had trodden, to you it is for inheritance, and to your sons — to the age, for you hast been fully after Yahweh my God.
\v 10 And, now, behold, Yahweh had kept me alive, as He had spoken, these forty and five years, since Yahweh spake this word unto Moses, when Israel went in the wilderness; and now, behold, I am to-day a son of five and eighty years;
\v 11 yet am I to-day strong as in the day of Moses' sending me; as my power then, so is my power now, for battle, and to go out, and to come in.
\v 12 And now, give to me this hill-country, of which Yahweh spake in that day, for you did hear in that day, for Anakim are there, and cities, great, fenced; if so be Yahweh is with me, then I have dispossessed them, as Yahweh had spoken.'
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh for an inheritance,
\v 14 therefore had Hebron been to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite for an inheritance unto this day, because that he was fully after Yahweh, God of Israel;
\v 15 and the name of Hebron formerly is Kirjath-Arba (he is the great man among the Anakim); and the land had rest from war.
\c 15
\v 1 And the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah, for their families, is unto the border of Edom; the wilderness of Zin southward, at the extremity of the south;
\v 2 and to them the south border is at the extremity of the salt sea, from the bay which is looking southward;
\v 3 and it had gone out unto the south to Maaleh-Akrabbim, and passed over to Zin, and gone up on the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and passed over to Hezron, and gone up to Adar, and turned round to Karkaa,
\v 4 and passed over to Azmon, and gone out at the brook of Egypt, and the outgoings of the border have been at the sea; this is to you the south border.

\v 12 And the west border is to the great sea, and its border; this is the border of the sons of Judah round about for their families.
\v 13 And to Caleb son of Jephunneh had he given a portion in the middle of the sons of Judah, according to the command of Yahweh to Joshua, even the city of Arba, father of Anak — it is Hebron.
\v 14 And Caleb is dispossessing there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, children of Anak,
\v 15 and he went up there unto the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir formerly is Kirjath-Sepher.
\v 16 And Caleb said, 'He who smiteth Kirjath-Sephar, and had captured it — I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.'
\v 17 And Othniel son of Kenaz, brother of Caleb, did capture it, and he gave to him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
\v 18 And it came to pass, in her coming in, that she persuadeth him to ask from her father a field, and she lighteth from off the ass, and Caleb said to her, 'What — to you?'
\v 19 And she said, 'Give to me a blessing; when the land of the south you hast given me, then you hast given to me springs of waters;' and he gave to her the upper springs and the lower springs.

\v 1 And the lot for the sons of Joseph went out from Jordan by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness going up from Jericho in the hill-country of Beth-El,
\v 2 and had gone out from Beth-El to Luz, and passed over unto the border of Archi to Ataroth,
\v 3 and gone down westward unto the border of Japhleti, unto the border of Beth-Horon the lower, and unto Gezer, and its outgoings have been at the sea.
\v 4 And the sons of Joseph — Manasseh and Ephraim — inherit.
\v 5 And the border of the sons of Ephraim is by their families; and the border of their inheritance is on the east, Atroth-Addar unto Beth-Horon the upper;
\v 6 and the border had gone out at the sea, to Michmethah on the north, and the border had gone round eastward to Taanath-Shiloh, and passed over it eastward to Janohah,
\v 7 and gone down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and touched against Jericho, and gone out at the Jordan.
\v 8 From Tappuah the border went westward unto the brook of Kanah, and its outgoings have been at the sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, for their families.
\v 9 And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim are in the middle of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages;
\v 10 and they have not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in the middle of Ephraim unto this day, and is to tribute — a servant.
\c 17
\v 1 And the lot is for the tribe of Manasseh (for he is first-born of Joseph), for Machir first-born of Manasseh, father of Gilead, for he had been a man of war, and his are Gilead and Bashan.
\v 2 And there is for the sons of Manasseh who are left, for their families; for the sons of Abiezer, and for the sons of Helek, and for the sons of Asriel, and for the sons of Shechem, and for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida; these are the children of Manasseh son of Joseph — the males — by their families.
\v 3 As to Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, he had no children except daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah,
\v 4 and they draw near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, 'Yahweh commanded Moses to give to us an inheritance in the middle of our brethren;' and he gave to them, at the command of Yahweh, an inheritance in the middle of the brethren of their father.
\v 5 And ten portions fall to Manasseh, apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan, which are beyond the Jordan;
\v 6 for the daughters of Manasseh have inherited an inheritance in the middle of his sons, and the land of Gilead had been to the sons of Manasseh who are left.
\v 7 And the border of Manasseh is from Asher to Michmethah, which is on the front of Shechem, and the border had gone on unto the right, unto the inhabitants of En-Tappuah.
\v 8 To Manasseh had been the land of Tappuah, and Tappuah unto the border of Manasseh is to the sons of Ephraim.
\v 9 And the border had come down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook; these cities of Ephraim are in the middle of the cities of Manasseh, and the border of Manasseh is on the north of the brook, and its outgoings are at the sea.
\v 10 Southward is to Ephraim and northward to Manasseh, and the sea is his border, and in Asher they meet on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
\v 11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, three counties.
\v 12 And the sons of Manasseh have not been able to occupy these cities, and the Canaanite is desirous to dwell in this land,
\v 13 and it came to pass when the sons of Israel have been strong, that they put the Canaanite to tribute, and have not utterly dispossessed him.
\v 14 And the sons of Joseph speak with Joshua, saying, 'Wherefore hast you given to me an inheritance — one lot and one portion, and I a numerous people? hitherto had Yahweh blessed me.'
\v 15 And Joshua said unto them, 'If you are a numerous people, go up for you to the forest, then you hast prepared for you there, in the land of the Perizzite, and of the Rephaim, when mount Ephraim had been narrow for you.'
\v 16 And the sons of Joseph say, 'The hill is not found to us, and a chariot of iron is with every Canaanite who is dwelling in the land of the valley — to him who is in Beth-Shean and its towns, and to him who is in the valley of Jezreel.'
\v 17 And Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, 'You are a numerous people, and hast great power; you hast not one lot only,
\v 18 because the mountain is yours; because it is a forest — you hast prepared it, and its outgoings have been yours; because you will dispossess the Canaanite, though it had chariots of iron — though it is strong.'
\c 18
\v 1 And all the company of the sons of Israel are assembled at Shiloh, and they cause the tent of meeting to tabernacle there, and the land had been subdued before them.
\v 2 And there are left among the sons of Israel who have not shared their inheritance, seven tribes,
\v 3 and Joshua said unto the sons of Israel, 'Till when are you remiss to go in to possess the land which He had given to you, Yahweh, God of your fathers?
\v 4 Give for you three men for a tribe, and I send them, and they rise and go up and down through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and come in unto me,
\v 5 and they have divided it into seven portions — Judah did stay by its border on the south, and the house of Joseph do stay by their border on the north — 
\v 6 and you describe the land in seven portions, and have brought it in unto me hither, and I have cast for you a lot here before Yahweh our God;
\v 7 for there is no portion to the Levites in your middle, for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance, and Gad, and Reuben, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses servant of Yahweh gave to them.'
\v 8 And the men rise and go; and Joshua commandeth those who are going to describe the land, saying, 'Go, and walk up and down through the land, and describe it, and turn back unto me, and here I cast for you a lot before Yahweh in Shiloh.'
\v 9 And the men go, and pass over through the land, and describe it by cities, in seven portions, on a book, and they come in unto Joshua, unto the camp, at Shiloh.
\v 10 And Joshua threw for them a lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, and there Joshua apportioneth the land to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions.
\v 11 And a lot went up for the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, for their families; and the border of their lot went out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
\v 12 And the border is to them at the north side from the Jordan, and the border had gone up unto the side of Jericho on the north, and gone up through the hill-country westward, and its outgoings have been at the wilderness of Beth-Aven;
\v 13 and the border had gone over there to Luz, unto the side of Luz (it is Beth-El) southward, and the border had gone down to Atroth-Addar, by the hill that is on the south of the lower Beth-Horon;
\v 14 and the border had been marked out, and had gone round to the corner of the sea southward, from the hill which is at the front of Beth-Horon southward, and its outgoings have been unto Kirjath-Baal (it is Kirjath-Jearim), a city of the sons of Judah: this is the west quarter.
\v 15 And the south quarter is from the end of Kirjath-Jearim, and the border had gone out westward, and gone out unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;
\v 16 and the border had come down unto the extremity of the hill which is on the front of the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the Rephaim northward, and had gone down the valley of Hinnom unto the side of Jebusi southward, and gone down to En-Rogel,
\v 17 and had been marked out on the north, and gone out to En-Shemesh, and gone out unto Geliloth, which is over-against the ascent of Adummim, and gone down to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben,
\v 18 and passed over unto the side over-against Arabah northward, and gone down to Arabah;
\v 19 and the border had passed over unto the side of Beth-Hoglah northward, and the outgoings of the border have been unto the north bay of the salt sea, unto the south extremity of the Jordan; this is the south border;
\v 20 and the Jordan did border it at the east quarter; this is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by its borders round about, for their families.
\v 21 And the cities for the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, for their families, have been Jericho, and Beth-Hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
\v 22 and Beth-Arabah, Zemaraim, and Beth-El,

\v 9 out of the portion of the sons of Judah is the inheritance of the sons of Simeon, for the portion of the sons of Judah had been too much for them, and the sons of Simeon inherit in the middle of their inheritance.
\v 10 And the third lot went up for the sons of Zebulun, for their families; and the border of their inheritance is unto Sarid,
\v 11 and their border had gone up towards the sea, and Maralah, and come against Dabbasheth, and come unto the brook which is on the front of Jokneam,
\v 12 and turned back from Sarid eastward, at the sun-rising, by the border of Chisloth-Tabor, and gone out unto Daberath, and gone up to Japhia,

\v 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan, for their families, these cities and their villages.
\v 49 And they finish to give the land in inheritance, by its borders, and the sons of Israel give an inheritance to Joshua son of Nun in their middle;
\v 50 by the command of Yahweh they have given to him the city which he asked, Timnath-Serah, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and he built the city and dwelleth in it.
\v 51 These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel, have caused to inherit by lot, in Shiloh, before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting; and they finish to apportion the land.
\c 20
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Joshua, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Give for you cities of refuge, as I have spoken unto you by the hand of Moses,
\v 3 for the fleeing thither of a man-slayer smiting life inadvertently, without knowledge; and they have been to you for a refuge from the redeemer of blood.
\v 4 When one had fled unto one of these cities, and had stood at the opening of the gate of the city, and had spoken in the ears of the elders of that city his matter, then they have gathered him into the city unto them, and have given to him a place, and he had dwelt with them.
\v 5 'And when the redeemer of blood did pursue after him, then they do not shut up the man-slayer into his hand, for without knowledge he had smitten his neighbour, and is not hating him hitherto;
\v 6 and he had dwelt in that city till his standing before the company for judgment, till the death of the chief priest who is in those days — then did the man-slayer turn back and had come unto his city, and unto his house, unto the city whence he fled.'
\v 7 And they sanctify Kedesh in Galilee, in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kirjath-Arba (it is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah;
\v 8 and beyond the Jordan, at Jericho eastward, they have given Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain, out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
\v 9 These have been cities of meeting for all the sons of Israel, and for a sojourner who is sojourning in their middle, for the fleeing thither of any one smiting life inadvertently, and he did not die by the hand of the redeemer of blood till his standing before the company.
\c 21
\v 1 And the heads of the fathers of the Levites draw nigh unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
\v 2 and they speak unto them in Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, saying, 'Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses to give to us cities to dwell in, and their suburbs for our cattle.'

\v 32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, the city of refuge for the man-slayer, Kedesh in Galilee and its suburbs, and Hammoth-Dor and its suburbs, and Kartan and its suburbs — three cities;
\v 33 all the cities of the Gershonite, for their families, are thirteen cities and their suburbs.
\v 34 And for the families of the sons of Merari, the Levites, who are left, are, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam and its suburbs, Kartah and its suburbs,
\v 35 Dimnah and its suburbs, Nahalal and its suburbs — four cities.
\v 36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer and its suburbs, and Jahazah and its suburbs,
\v 37 Kedemoth and its suburbs, and Mephaath and its suburbs — four cities.
\v 38 And out of the tribe of Gad, the city of refuge for the man-slayer, Ramoth in Gilead and its suburbs, and Mahanaim and its suburbs,
\v 39 Heshbon and its suburbs, Jazer and its suburbs — in all four cities.
\v 40 All the cities for the sons of Merari, for their families, who are left of the families of the Levites — their lot is twelve cities.
\v 41 All the cities of the Levites in the middle of the possession of the sons of Israel are forty and eight cities, and their suburbs.
\v 42 These cities are each city and its suburbs round about it; so to all these cities.
\v 43 And Yahweh gave to Israel the whole of the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possess it, and dwell in it;
\v 44 and Yahweh gave rest to them round about, according to all that which He had sworn to their fathers, and there had not stood a man in their presence of all their enemies, the whole of their enemies had Yahweh given into their hand;
\v 45 there had not fallen a thing of all the good thing which Yahweh spake unto the house of Israel — the whole had come.
\c 22
\v 1 Then Joshua called for the Reubenite, and for the Gadite, and for the half of the tribe of Manasseh,
\v 2 and said unto them, 'Ye — you have kept the whole of that which Moses, servant of Yahweh, commanded you, and you hearken to my voice, to all that I have commanded you;
\v 3 you have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, and have kept the charge — the command of Yahweh your God.
\v 4 'And, now, Yahweh your God had given rest to your brethren, as He spake to them; and now, turn you, and go for yourselves to your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses, servant of Yahweh, had given to you beyond the Jordan.
\v 5 Only, be very watchful to do the command and the law which Moses, servant of Yahweh, commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and to cleave to Him, and to serve Him, with all your heart, and with all your soul.'
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them, and sent them away, and they go unto their tents.
\v 7 And to the half of the tribe of Manasseh had Moses given, in Bashan, and to its other half had Joshua given with their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; and also when Joshua had sent them away unto their tents, then he did bless them,
\v 8 and speak unto them, saying, 'With great riches turn you back unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.'
\v 9 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, turn back and go from the sons of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, unto the land of their possession, in which they have possession, according to the command of Yahweh, by the hand of Moses;
\v 10 and they come in unto the districts of the Jordan, which are in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, build there an altar by the Jordan — a great altar for appearance.
\v 11 And the sons of Israel hear, saying, 'Lo, the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, have built the altar over-against the land of Canaan, on the districts of the Jordan, at the passage of the sons of Israel.'
\v 12 And the sons of Israel hear, and all the company of the sons of Israel is assembled at Shiloh, to go up against them to war;
\v 13 and the sons of Israel send unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the half of the tribe of Manasseh — unto the land of Gilead — Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest,
\v 14 and ten princes with him, one prince, one prince, for a house of a father, for all the tribes of Israel, and each of them a head of a house of their fathers, for the thousands of Israel.
\v 15 And they come in unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the half of the tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and speak with them, saying,
\v 16 Thus said all the company of Yahweh, What is this trespass which you have trespassed against the God of Israel, to turn back to-day from after Yahweh, by your building for you an altar, for your rebelling to-day against Yahweh?
\v 17 Is the iniquity of Peor little to us, from which we have not been cleansed till this day — and the plague is in the company of Yahweh,
\v 18 that you turn back to-day from after Yahweh? and it had been — you rebel to-day against Yahweh — and to-morrow against all the company of Israel He is wroth.
\v 19 'And surely, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over for you unto the land of the possession of Yahweh, where the tabernacle of Yahweh had tabernacled, and have possession in our middle; and against Yahweh rebel not, and against us rebel not, by your building for you an altar, besides the altar of Yahweh our God.
\v 20 Did not Achan son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and on all the company of Israel there was wrath? and he alone expired not in his iniquity.'
\v 21 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, answer and speak with the heads of the thousands of Israel:
\v 22 The God of gods — Yahweh, the God of gods — Yahweh, He is knowing, and Israel, he did know, if in rebellion, and if in trespass against Yahweh (You will not save us this day!)
\v 23 we are building for ourselves an altar to turn back from after Yahweh, and if to cause to go up on it burnt-offering and present, and if to make on it peace-offerings — Yahweh Himself did require it.
\v 24 And if not, from fear of this thing we have done it, saying, Hereafter your sons do speak to ours sons, saying, What to you and to Yahweh God of Israel?
\v 25 for a border had Yahweh put between us and you, O sons of Reuben, and sons of Gad — Jordan; you have no portion in Yahweh — and your sons have caused our sons to cease, not to fear Yahweh.
\v 26 And we say, Pray let us prepare for ourselves to build the altar — not for burnt-offering nor for sacrifice — 
\v 27 but a witness it is between us and you, and between our generations after us, to do the service of Yahweh before Him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings, and your sons do not say hereafter to our sons, Ye have no portion in Yahweh.
\v 28 And we say, And it had been, when they say so unto us, and unto our generations hereafter, that we have said, See the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made — not for burnt-offering nor for sacrifice — but a witness it is between us and you.
\v 29 Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, and to turn back to-day from after Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for present, and for sacrifice, apart from the altar of Yahweh our God, which is before His tabernacle.'
\v 30 And Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the company, and the heads of the thousands of Israel, who are with him, hear the words which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh have spoken, and it is good in their eyes.
\v 31 And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the sons of Manasseh, 'To-day we have known that Yahweh is in our middle, because you have not committed against Yahweh this trespass — then you have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.'
\v 32 And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, turn back from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, unto the sons of Israel, and bring them back word;
\v 33 and the thing is good in the eyes of the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel bless God, and have not said to go up against them to war, to destroy the land which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, are dwelling in.
\v 34 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad proclaim concerning the altar, that 'it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.'
\c 23
\v 1 And it came to pass, many days after that Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua is old, entering into days,
\v 2 and Joshua called for all Israel, for its elders, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its authorities, and said unto them, 'I have become old; I have entered into days;
\v 3 and you — you have seen all that Yahweh your God had done to all these nations because of you, for Yahweh your God is He who is fighting for you;
\v 4 see, I have caused to fall to you these nations who are left for an inheritance to your tribes, from the Jordan, (and all the nations which I cut off), and the great sea, the going in of the sun.
\v 5 'As to Yahweh your God, He did thrust them from your presence, and had dispossessed them from before you, and you have possessed their land, as Yahweh your God had spoken to you,
\v 6 and you have been very strong to keep and to do the whole that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, so as not to turn aside from it right or left,
\v 7 so as not to go in among these nations, these who are left with you; and of the name of their gods you do not make mention, nor do you swear, nor do you serve them, nor do you bow yourselves to them;
\v 8 but to Yahweh your God you do cleave, as you have done till this day.
\v 9 And Yahweh is dispossessing from before you nations great and mighty; as for you, none had stood in your presence till this day;
\v 10 one man of you did pursue a thousand, for Yahweh your God is He who is fighting for you, as He had spoken to you;
\v 11 and you have been very watchful for yourselves to love Yahweh your God.
\v 12 But — if you at all turn back and have cleaved to the remnant of these nations, these who are left with you, and intermarried with them, and gone in to them, and they to you,
\v 13 know certainly that Yahweh your God is not continuing to dispossess these nations from before you, and they have been to you for a gin, and for a snare, and for a scourge, in your sides, and for thorns in your eyes, till you perish from off this good ground which Yahweh your God had given to you.
\v 14 And behold, I am going, to-day, in the way of all the earth, and you have known — with all your heart, and with all your soul — that there had not fallen one thing of all the good things which Yahweh your God had spoken concerning you; the whole have come to you; there had not failed of it one thing.
\v 15 'And it had been, as there had come upon you all the good thing which Yahweh your God had spoken unto you, so did Yahweh bring upon you the whole of the evil thing, till His destroying you from off this good ground which Yahweh your God had given to you;
\v 16 in your transgressing the covenant of Yahweh your God which He commanded you, and you have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them, then had the anger of Yahweh burned against you, and you have perished hastily from off the good land which He had given to you.'
\c 24
\v 1 And Joshua gathereth all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its authorities, and they station themselves before God.
\v 2 And Joshua said unto all the people, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Beyond the River have your fathers dwelt of old — Terah father of Abraham and father of Nachor — and they serve other gods;
\v 3 and I take your father Abraham from beyond the River, and cause him to go through all the land of Canaan, and multiply his seed, and give to him Isaac.
\v 4 And I give to Isaac, Jacob and Esau; and I give to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons have gone down to Egypt.
\v 5 And I send Moses and Aaron, and plague Egypt, as I have done in its middle, and afterwards I have brought you out.
\v 6 And I bring out your fathers from Egypt, and you go into the sea, and the Egyptians pursue after your fathers, with chariot and with horsemen, to the Red Sea;
\v 7 and they cry unto Yahweh, and He setteth thick darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought on them the sea, and covereth them, and your eyes see that which I have done in Egypt; and you dwell in a wilderness many days.
\v 8 'And I bring you in unto the land of the Amorite who is dwelling beyond the Jordan, and they fight with you, and I give them into your hand, and you possess their land, and I destroy them out of your presence.
\v 9 'And Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, riseth and fighteth against Israel, and sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to revile you,
\v 10 and I have not been willing to hearken to Balaam, and he did greatly bless you, and I deliver you out of his hand.
\v 11 And you pass over the Jordan, and come in unto Jericho, and fight against you do the possessors of Jericho — the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite — and I give them into your hand.
\v 12 And I send before you the hornet, and it threw them out from your presence — two kings of the Amorite — not by your sword, nor by your bow.
\v 13 'And I give to you a land for which you hast not laboured, and cities which you have not built, and you dwell in them; of vineyards and olive-yards which you have not planted you are eating.
\v 14 'And now, fear you Yahweh, and serve Him, in perfection and in truth, and turn aside the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve you Yahweh;
\v 15 and if wrong in your eyes to serve Yahweh — choose for you to-day whom you do serve; — whether the gods whom your fathers served, which are beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorite in whose land you are dwelling; and I and my house — we serve Yahweh.'
\v 16 And the people answer and say, 'Far be it from us to forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;
\v 17 for Yahweh our God is He who is bringing us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants, and who had done before our eyes these great signs, and did keep us in all the way in which we have gone, and among all the peoples through whose middle we passed;
\v 18 and Yahweh threw out the whole of the peoples, even the Amorite inhabiting the land, from our presence; we also do serve Yahweh, for He is our God.'
\v 19 And Joshua said unto the people, 'Ye are not able to serve Yahweh, for a God most holy He is; a zealous God He is; He did not bear with your transgression and with your sins.
\v 20 When you forsake Yahweh, and have served gods of a stranger, then He had turned back and done evil to you, and consumed you, after that He had done good to you.'
\v 21 And the people said unto Joshua, 'No, but Yahweh we do serve.'
\v 22 And Joshua said unto the people, 'Witnesses you are against yourselves, that you have chosen for you Yahweh to serve Him (and they say, 'Witnesses!')
\v 23 and, now, turn aside the gods of the stranger which are in your middle, and incline your heart unto Yahweh, God of Israel.'
\v 24 And the people say unto Joshua, 'Yahweh our God we serve, and to His voice we hearken.'
\v 25 And Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and laid on it a statute and an ordinance, in Shechem.
\v 26 And Joshua writeth these words in the Book of the Law of God, and took a great stone, and raiseth it up there under the oak which is in the sanctuary of Yahweh.
\v 27 And Joshua said unto all the people, 'Lo, this stone is against us for a witness, for it had heard all the sayings of Yahweh which He had spoken with us, and it had been against you for a witness, lest you lie against your God.'
\v 28 And Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.
\v 29 And it came to pass, after these things, that Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten years,
\v 30 and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath-Serah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the hill of Gaash.
\v 31 And Israel serveth Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, and who knew all the work of Yahweh which He did to Israel.
\v 32 And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor father of Shechem, with a hundred kesitah; and they are to the sons of Joseph for an inheritance.
\v 33 And Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they bury him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the hill-country of Ephraim.
