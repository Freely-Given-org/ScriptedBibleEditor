\c 1
\v 1 These are the words which Moses had spoken unto all Israel, beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain over-against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-Zahab;
\v 2 eleven days' from Horeb, the way of mount Seir, unto Kadesh-Barnea.
\v 3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month had Moses spoken unto the sons of Israel according to all that Yahweh had commanded him concerning them;
\v 4 after his smiting Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan who is dwelling in Ashtaroth in Edrei,
\v 5 beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, had Moses begun to explain this law, saying:
\v 6 Yahweh our God had spoken unto us in Horeb, saying, Enough to you — of dwelling in this mount;
\v 7 turn you and journey for you, and enter the mount of the Amorite, and unto all its neighbouring places, in the plain, in the hill-country, and in the low country, and in the south, and in the haven of the sea, the land of the Canaanite, and of Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Phrat;
\v 8 see, I have set before you the land; go in and possess the land which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them, and to their seed after them.
\v 9 'And I speak unto you at that time, saying, I am not able by myself to bear you;
\v 10 Yahweh your God had multiplied you, and behold, you are to-day as the stars of the heavens for multitude;
\v 11 Yahweh, God of your fathers, is adding to you, as you are, a thousand times, and did bless you as He had spoken to you.
\v 12 'How do I bear by myself your pressure, and your burden, and your strife?
\v 13 Give for yourselves men, wise and intelligent, and known to your tribes, and I set them for your heads;
\v 14 and you answer me and say, Good is the thing which you hast spoken — to do.
\v 15 'And I take the heads of your tribes, men, wise and known, and I appoint them heads over you, princes of thousands, and princes of hundreds, and princes of fifties, and princes of tens, and authorities, for your tribes.
\v 16 And I command your judges at that time, saying, Hearkening between your brethren — then you have judged righteousness between a man, and his brother, and his sojourner;
\v 17 you do not discern faces in judgment; as the little so the great you do hear; you are not afraid of the face of any, for the judgment is God's, and the thing which is too hard for you, you bring near unto me, and I have heard it;
\v 18 and I command you, at that time, all the things which you do.
\v 19 And we journey from Horeb, and go through all that great and fearful wilderness which you have seen — the way of the hill-country of the Amorite, as Yahweh our God had commanded us, and we come in unto Kadesh-Barnea.
\v 20 'And I say unto you, Ye have come in unto the hill-country of the Amorite, which Yahweh our God is giving to us;
\v 21 see, Yahweh your God had set before you the land; go up, possess, as Yahweh, God of your fathers, had spoken to you; fear not, nor be frightened.
\v 22 And you come near unto me, all of you, and say, Let us send men before us, and they search for us the land, and they bring us back word concerning the way in which we go up into it, and the cities unto which we come in;
\v 23 and the thing is good in mine eyes, and I take of you twelve men, one man for a tribe.
\v 24 'And they turn and go up to the hill-country, and come in unto the valley of Eshcol, and spy it,
\v 25 and they take with their hand of the fruit of the land, and bring down unto us, and bring us back word, and say, Good is the land which Yahweh our God is giving to us.
\v 26 'And you have not been willing to go up, and you provoke the mouth of Yahweh your God,
\v 27 and murmur in your tents, and say, In Yahweh's hating us He had brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorite — to destroy us;
\v 28 where are we going up? our brethren have melted our heart, saying, A people greater and taller than we, cities great and fenced to heaven, and also sons of Anakim — we have seen there.
\v 29 'And I say unto you, Be not terrified, nor be afraid of them;
\v 30 Yahweh your God, who is going before you — He did fight for you, according to all that He had done with you in Egypt before your eyes,
\v 31 and in the wilderness, where you hast seen that Yahweh your God had borne you as a man beareth his son, in all the way which you have gone, till your coming in unto this place.
\v 32 'And in this thing you are not stedfast in Yahweh your God,
\v 33 who is going before you in the way to search out to you a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to shew you in the way in which you go, and in a cloud by day.
\v 34 'And Yahweh heareth the voice of your words, and is wroth, and sweareth, saying,
\v 35 Not one of these men of this evil generation did see the good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,
\v 36 save Caleb son of Jephunneh — he did see it, and to him I give the land on which he had trodden, and to his sons, because that he had been fully after Yahweh.
\v 37 'Also with me had Yahweh been angry for your sake, saying, Also, you will not go in thither;
\v 38 Joshua son of Nun, who is standing before you, he went in thither; him strengthen you; for he did cause Israel to inherit.
\v 39 'And your infants, of whom you have said, For a prey they are, and your sons who have not known to-day good and evil, they go in thither, and to them I give it, and they possess it;
\v 40 and you, turn for yourselves, and journey toward the wilderness, the way of the Red Sea.
\v 41 And you answer and say unto me, We have sinned against Yahweh; we — we go up, and we have fought, according to all that which Yahweh our God had commanded us; and you gird on each his weapons of war, and you are ready to go up into the hill-country;
\v 42 and Yahweh said unto me, Say to them, Ye do not go up, nor fight, for I am not in your middle, and you are not smitten before your enemies.
\v 43 'And I speak unto you, and you have not hearkened, and provoke the mouth of Yahweh, and act proudly, and go up into the hill-country;
\v 44 and the Amorite who is dwelling in that hill-country came out to meet you, and they pursue you as the bees do, and smite you in Seir — unto Hormah.
\v 45 'And you turn back and weep before Yahweh, and Yahweh had not hearkened to your voice, nor had he given ear unto you;
\v 46 and you dwell in Kadesh many days, according to the days which you had dwelt.
\c 2
\v 1 'And we turn, and journey into the wilderness, the way of the Red Sea, as Yahweh had spoken unto me, and we go round the mount of Seir many days.
\v 2 'And Yahweh spoke unto me, saying,
\v 3 Enough to you — is the going round of this mount; turn for yourselves northward.
\v 4 'And the people command you, saying, Ye are passing over into the border of your brethren, sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, and they are afraid of you; and you have been very watchful,
\v 5 you do not strive with them, for I do not give to you of their land even the treading of the sole of a foot; for a possession to Esau I have given mount Seir.
\v 6 'Food you buy from them with money, and have eaten; and also water you buy from them with money, and have drunk,
\v 7 for Yahweh your God had blessed you in all the work of your hands; He had known your walking in this great wilderness these forty years; Yahweh your God is with you; you hast not lacked anything.
\v 8 'And we pass by from our brethren, sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, by the way of the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-Gaber; and we turn, and pass over the way of the wilderness of Moab;
\v 9 and Yahweh said unto me, Do not distress Moab, nor stir thyself up against them in battle, for I do not give to you of their land for a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given Ar for a possession.'
\v 10 'The Emim formerly have dwelt in it, a people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim;
\v 11 Rephaim they are reckoned, they also, as the Anakim; and the Moabites call them Emim.
\v 12 And in Seir have the Horim dwelt formerly; and the sons of Esau dispossess them, and destroy them from before them, and dwell in their stead, as Israel had done to the land of his possession, which Yahweh had given to them;
\v 13 now, rise you, and pass over for yourselves the brook Zered; and we pass over the brook Zered.
\v 14 And the days which we have walked from Kadesh-Barnea until that we have passed over the brook Zered, are thirty and eight years, till the consumption of all the generation of the men of battle from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh had sworn to them;
\v 15 and also the hand of Yahweh had been against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, till they are consumed.
\v 16 'And it came to pass, when all the men of battle have finished dying from the middle of the people,
\v 17 that Yahweh spoke unto me, saying,
\v 18 You are passing over to-day the border of Moab, even Ar,
\v 19 and you hast come near over-against the sons of Ammon, you will not distress them, nor stir up thyself against them, for I do not give any of the land of the sons of Ammon to you for a possession; for to the sons of Lot I have given it for a possession.
\v 20 'A land of Rephaim it is reckoned, even it; Rephaim dwelt in it formerly, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;
\v 21 a people great, and numerous, and tall, as the Anakim, and Yahweh destroyeth them before them, and they dispossess them, and dwell in their stead,
\v 22 as He had done for the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, when He destroyed the Horim from before them, and they dispossess them, and dwell in their stead, unto this day.
\v 23 As to the Avim who are dwelling in Hazerim unto Azzah, the Caphtorim — who are coming out from Caphtor — have destroyed them, and dwell in their stead.
\v 24 Rise you, journey and pass over the brook Arnon; see, I have given into your hand Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land; begin to possess, and stir up thyself against him in battle.
\v 25 This day I begin to put your dread and your fear on the face of the peoples under the whole heavens, who hear your fame, and have trembled and been pained because of you.
\v 26 And I send messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth, unto Sihon king of Heshbon, — words of peace — saying,
\v 27 Let me pass over through your land; in the several ways I go; I turn not aside — right or left — 
\v 28 food for money you will sell me, and I have eaten; and water for money you will give to me, and I have drunk; only, let me pass over on my feet, — 
\v 29 as the sons of Esau who are dwelling in Seir, and the Moabites who are dwelling in Ar, have done to me — till that I pass over the Jordan, unto the land which Yahweh our God is giving to us.
\v 30 'And Sihon king of Heshbon had not been willing to let us pass over by him, for Yahweh your God had hardened his spirit, and strengthened his heart, so as to give him into your hand as at this day.
\v 31 And Yahweh said unto me, See, I have begun to give before you Sihon and his land; begin to possess — to possess his land.
\v 32 'And Sihon came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle to Jahaz;
\v 33 and Yahweh our God gave him before us, and we smite him, and his sons, and all his people;
\v 34 and we capture all his cities at that time, and devote the whole city, men, and the women, and the infants — we have not left a remnant;
\v 35 only, the cattle we have spoiled for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we have captured.
\v 36 From Aroer, which is by the edge of the brook Arnon, and the city which is by the brook, even unto Gilead there had not been a city which is too high for us; the whole had Yahweh our God given before us.
\v 37 Only, unto the land of the sons of Ammon you hast not drawn near, any part of the brook Jabbok, and cities of the hill-country, and anything which Yahweh our God had not commanded.
\c 3
\v 1 And we turn, and go up the way to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle, to Edrei.
\v 2 'And Yahweh said unto me, Fear him not, for into your hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and you hast done to him as you hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite who is dwelling in Heshbon.
\v 3 'And Yahweh our God gave into our hands also Og king of Bashan, and all his people, and we smite him till there had not been left to him a remnant;
\v 4 and we capture all his cities at that time, there had not been a city which we have not taken from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\v 5 All these are cities fenced with high walls, two-leaved doors and bar, apart from cities of villages very many;
\v 6 and we devote them, as we have done to Sihon king of Heshbon, devoting every city, men, the women, and the infants;
\v 7 and all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we have spoiled for ourselves.
\v 8 'And we take, at that time, the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorite, which is beyond the Jordan, from the brook Arnon unto mount Hermon;
\v 9 (Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir,)
\v 10 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan,
\v 11 for only Og king of Bashan had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead is a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits its length, and four cubits its breadth, by the cubit of a man.
\v 12 And this land we have possessed, at that time; from Aroer, which is by the brook Arnon, and the half of mount Gilead, and its cities, I have given to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite;
\v 13 and the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I have given to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, to all that Bashan, called the land of Rephaim.
\v 14 'Jair son of Manasseh had taken all the region of Argob, unto the border of Geshuri, and Maachadi, and called them by his own name, Bashan-Havoth-Jair, unto this day.
\v 15 And to Machir I have given Gilead.
\v 16 'And to the Reubenite and to the Gadite I have given from Gilead even unto the brook Arnon, the middle of the valley and the border, even unto Jabbok the brook, the border of the sons of Ammon,
\v 17 and the plain, and the Jordan, and the border, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, the salt sea, under the springs of Pisgah, at the sun -rising.
\v 18 'And I command you, at that time, saying, Yahweh your God had given to you this land to possess it; armed you pass over before your brethren the sons of Israel, all the sons of might.
\v 19 Only, your wives, and your infants, and your cattle — I have known that you have much cattle — do dwell in your cities which I have given to you,
\v 20 till that Yahweh give rest to your brethren like yourselves, and they also have possessed the land which Yahweh your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan, then you have turned back each to his possession, which I have given to you.
\v 21 And Jehoshua I have commanded at that time, saying, Thine eyes are seeing all that which Yahweh your God had done to these two kings — so did Yahweh to all the kingdoms where you are passing over;
\v 22 fear them not, for Yahweh your God, He is fighting for you.
\v 23 'And I entreat for grace unto Yahweh, at that time, saying,
\v 24 Lord Yahweh, You — You hast begun to shew Your servant Your greatness, and Your strong hand; for who is a God in the heavens or in earth who did according to Your works, and according to Your might?
\v 25 Let me pass over, I pray Thee, and see the good land which is beyond the Jordan, this good hill-country, and Lebanon.
\v 26 'And Yahweh sheweth himself wroth with me, for your sake, and had not hearkened unto me, and Yahweh said unto me, Enough for you; add not to speak unto Me any more about this thing:
\v 27 go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up yours eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with yours eyes — for you will not pass over this Jordan;
\v 28 and charge Jehoshua, and strengthen him, and harden him, for he did pass over before this people, and he did cause them to inherit the land which you seest.
\v 29 'And we dwell in a valley over-against Beth-Peor.
\c 4
\v 1 'And now, Israel, hearken unto the statutes, and unto the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that you live, and have gone in, and possessed the land which Yahweh God of your fathers is giving to you.
\v 2 Ye do not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor diminish from it, to keep the commands of Yahweh your God which I am commanding you.
\v 3 'Your eyes are seeing that which Yahweh had done in Baal-Peor, for every man who had gone after Baal-Peor, Yahweh your God had destroyed him from your middle;
\v 4 and you who are cleaving to Yahweh your God, are alive, all of you, to-day.
\v 5 See, I have taught you statutes and judgments, as Yahweh my God had commanded me — to do so, in the middle of the land where you are going in to possess it;
\v 6 and you have kept and done them (for it is your wisdom and your understanding) before the eyes of the peoples who hear all these statutes, and they have said, Only, a people wise and understanding is this great nation.
\v 7 For which is the great nation that had God near unto it, as Yahweh our God, in all we have called unto him?
\v 8 and which is the great nation which had righteous statutes and judgments according to all this law which I am setting before you to-day?
\v 9 'Only, take heed to thyself, and watch your soul exceedingly, lest you forget the things which yours eyes have seen, and lest they turn aside from your heart, all days of your life; and you hast made them known to your sons, and to your sons' sons.
\v 10 The day when you hast stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb — in Yahweh's saying unto me, Assemble to Me the people, and I cause them to hear My words, so that they learn to fear Me all the days that they are alive on the ground, and their sons they teach; — 
\v 11 and you draw near and stand under the mountain, and the mountain is burning with fire unto the heart of the heavens — darkness, cloud, yea, thick darkness:
\v 12 'And Yahweh spoke unto you out of the middle of the fire; a voice of words you are hearing and a similitude you are not seeing, only a voice;
\v 13 and He declareth to you His covenant, which He had commanded you to do, the Ten Matters, and He writeth them upon two tables of stone.
\v 14 'And me had Yahweh commanded at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, for your doing them in the land where you are passing over to possess it;
\v 15 and you have been very watchful of your souls, for you have not seen any similitude in the day of Yahweh's speaking unto you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,
\v 16 lest you do corruptly, and have made to you a graven image, a similitude of any figure, a form of male or female — 
\v 17 a form of any beast which is in the earth — a form of any winged bird which flieth in the heavens — 
\v 18 a form of any creeping thing on the ground — a form of any fish which is in the waters under the earth;
\v 19 'And lest you lift up yours eyes towards the heavens, and hast seen the sun, and the moon, and the stars, all the host of the heavens, and you hast been forced, and hast bowed thyself to them, and served them, which Yahweh your God had apportioned to all the peoples under the whole heavens.
\v 20 And you had Yahweh taken, and He is bringing you out from the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be to Him for a people — an inheritance, as at this day.
\v 21 And Yahweh had showed himself wroth with me because of your words, and sweareth to my not passing over the Jordan, and to my not going in unto the good land which Yahweh your God is giving to you — an inheritance;
\v 22 for I am dying in this land; I am not passing over the Jordan, and you are passing over, and have possessed this good land.
\v 23 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which He had made with you, and have made to yourselves a graven image, a similitude of anything concerning which Yahweh your God had charged you:
\v 24 for Yahweh your God is a fire consuming — a zealous God.
\v 25 When you begettest sons and sons' sons, and you have become old in the land, and have done corruptly, and have made a graven image, a similitude of anything, and have done the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, to provoke Him to anger: — 
\v 26 I have caused to testify against you this day the heavens and the earth, that you do perish utterly hastily from off the land where you are passing over the Jordan to possess it; you do not prolong days upon it, but are utterly destroyed;
\v 27 and Yahweh had scattered you among the peoples, and you have been left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh leadeth you,
\v 28 and you have served there gods, work of man's hands, wood and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\v 29 And — you have sought from there Yahweh your God, and hast found, when you seekest Him with all your heart, and with all your soul,
\v 30 in distress being to you, and all these things have found you, in the latter end of the days, and you hast turned back unto Yahweh your God, and hast hearkened to His voice;
\v 31 for a merciful God is Yahweh your God; He did not fail you, nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers, which He had sworn to them.
\v 32 For, ask, I pray you, at the former days which have been before you, from the day that God prepared man on the earth, and from the one end of the heavens even unto the other end of the heavens, whether there had been as this great thing — or had been heard like it?
\v 33 Hath a people heard the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you hast heard, you — and did live?
\v 34 Or had God tried to go in to take to Himself, a nation from the middle of a nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terrors — according to all that Yahweh your God had done to you, in Egypt, before your eyes?
\v 35 You, you hast been shewn it, to know that Yahweh He is God; there is none else besides Him.
\v 36 'From the heavens He had caused you to hear His voice, to instruct you, and on earth He had showed you His great fire, and His words you hast heard out of the middle of the fire.
\v 37 'And because that He had loved your fathers, He did also fix on their seed after them, and did bring you out, in His presence, by His great power, from Egypt:
\v 38 to dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, from your presence, to bring you in to give to you their land — an inheritance, as at this day.
\v 39 And you hast known to-day, and hast turned it back unto your heart, that Yahweh He is God, in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath — there is none else;
\v 40 and you hast kept His statutes and His commands which I am commanding you to-day, so that it is well to you, and to your sons after you, and so that you prolongest days on the ground which Yahweh your God is giving to you — all the days.'
\v 41 Then Moses separated three cities beyond the Jordan, towards the sun-rising,
\v 42 for the fleeing thither of the man-slayer, who slaid his neighbour unknowingly, and he is not hating him heretofore, and he had fled unto one of these cities, and he had lived:
\v 43 Bezer, in the wilderness, in the land of the plain, of the Reubenite; and Ramoth, in Gilead, of the Gadite; and Golan, in Bashan, of the Manassahite.
\v 44 And this is the law which Moses had set before the sons of Israel;
\v 45 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses had spoken unto the sons of Israel, in their coming out of Egypt,
\v 46 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over-against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel have smitten, in their coming out of Egypt,
\v 47 and they possess his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorite who are beyond the Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
\v 48 from Aroer, which is by the edge of the brook Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon — 
\v 49 and all the plain beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
\c 5
\v 1 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, 'Hear, Israel, the statutes and the judgments which I am speaking in your ears to-day, and you have learned them, and have observed to do them.
\v 2 Yahweh our God made with us a covenant in Horeb;
\v 3 not with our fathers had Yahweh made this covenant, but with us; we — these — here to-day — all of us alive.
\v 4 Face to face had Yahweh spoken with you, in the mount, out of the middle of the fire;
\v 5 I am standing between Yahweh and you, at that time, to declare to you the word of Yahweh, for you have been afraid from the presence of the fire, and you have not gone up into the mount; saying:
\v 6 I Yahweh am your God, who had brought you out from the land of Egypt, from a house of servants.
\v 7 'You hast no other gods in My presence.
\v 8 You will not make to you a graven image, any similitude which is in the heavens above, and which is in the earth beneath, and which is in the waters under the earth;
\v 9 you will not bow thyself to them nor serve them, for I Yahweh your God am a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on children, and on a third generation, and on a fourth, to those hating Me;
\v 10 and doing kindness to thousands, to those loving Me, and to those keeping My commands.
\v 11 'You will not take up the Name of Yahweh your God for a vain thing, for Yahweh did not acquit him who took up His Name for a vain thing.
\v 12 Observe the day of the sabbath — to sanctify it, as Yahweh your God had commanded you;
\v 13 six days you will labour, and hast done all your work,
\v 14 and the seventh day is a sabbath to Yahweh your God; you will not do any work, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your handmaid, and yours ox, and yours ass, and all your cattle, and your sojourner who is within your gates; so that your man-servant, and your handmaid did rest like thyself;
\v 15 and you hast remembered that a servant you hast been in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God is bringing you out there by a strong hand, and by a stretched-out arm; therefore had Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the day of the sabbath.
\v 16 'Honour your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God had commanded you, so that your days are prolonged, and so that it is well with you, on the ground which Yahweh your God is giving to you.
\v 17 'You will not murder.
\v 18 'You will not commit adultery.
\v 19 'You will not steal.
\v 20 You will not answer against your neighbour — a false testimony.
\v 21 You will not desire your neighbour's wife; nor will you covet your neighbour's house, his field, and his man-servant, and his handmaid, his ox, and his ass, and anything which is your neighbour's.
\v 22 These words had Yahweh spoken unto all your assembly, in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness — a great voice; and He had not added, and He writeth them on two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.
\v 23 'And it came to pass as you hear the voice out of the middle of the darkness, and of the mountain burning with fire, that you come near unto me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders,
\v 24 and say, Lo, Yahweh our God had showed us His honour, and His greatness; and His voice we have heard out of the middle of the fire; this day we have seen that God did speak with man — and he had lived.
\v 25 And, now, why do we die? for consume us did this great fire — if we add to hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more — then we have died.
\v 26 For who of all flesh is he who had heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire like us — and did live?
\v 27 Draw near you, and hear all that which Yahweh our God said, and you, you will speak unto us all that which Yahweh our God spoke unto you, and we have hearkened, and done it.
\v 28 And Yahweh heareth the voice of your words, in your speaking unto me, and Yahweh said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto you; they have done well in all that they have spoken.
\v 29 O that their heart had been thus to them, to fear Me, and to keep My commands all the days, that it may be well with them, and with their sons — to the age!
\v 30 'Go, say to them, Turn back for yourselves, to your tents;
\v 31 and you here stand you with Me, and let Me speak unto you all the command, and the statutes, and the judgments which you will teach them, and they have done in the land which I am giving to them to possess it.
\v 32 And you have observed to do as Yahweh your God had commanded you, you turn not aside — right or left;
\v 33 in all the way which Yahweh your God had commanded you you walk, so that you live, and it is well with you, and you have prolonged days in the land which you possess.
\c 6
\v 1 And this is the command, the statutes and the judgments which Yahweh your God had commanded to teach you, to do in the land which you are passing over thither to possess it,
\v 2 so that you will fear Yahweh your God, to keep all His statutes and His commands, which I am commanding you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all days of your life, and so that your days are prolonged.
\v 3 And you hast heard, O Israel, and observed to do, that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply exceedingly, as Yahweh, God of your fathers, had spoken to you, in the land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 4 Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our God is one Yahweh;
\v 5 and you hast loved Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might,
\v 6 and these words which I am commanding you to-day have been on yours heart,
\v 7 and you hast repeated them to your sons, and spoken of them in your sitting in yours house, and in your walking in the way, and in your lying down, and in your rising up,
\v 8 and hast bound them for a sign upon your hand, and they have been for frontlets between yours eyes,
\v 9 and you hast written them on door-posts of your house, and on your gates.
\v 10 And it had been, when Yahweh your God did bring you in unto the land which He had sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to you — cities great and good, which you hast not built,
\v 11 and houses full of all good things which you hast not filled, and wells digged which you hast not digged, vineyards and olive-yards which you hast not planted, and you hast eaten, and been satisfied;
\v 12 'Take heed to thyself lest you forget Yahweh who had brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants;
\v 13 Yahweh your God you will fear, and Him you will serve, and by His name you will swear;
\v 14 you do not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are round about you;
\v 15 for a zealous God is Yahweh your God in your middle — lest the anger of Yahweh your God burn against you, and He had destroyed you from off the face of the ground.
\v 16 'Ye do not try Yahweh your God as you tried in Massah;
\v 17 you do diligently keep the commands of Yahweh your God, and His testimonies, and His statutes which He had commanded you,
\v 18 and you hast done that which is right and good in the eyes of Yahweh, so that it is well with you, and you hast gone in and possessed the good land which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers,
\v 19 to drive away all yours enemies from your presence, as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 20 When your son asketh you hereafter, saying, What are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Yahweh our God had commanded you?
\v 21 then you hast said to your son, Servants we have been to Pharaoh in Egypt, and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt by a high hand;
\v 22 and Yahweh gave signs and wonders, great and sad, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
\v 23 and us He had brought out there, in order to bring us in, to give to us the land which He had sworn to our fathers.
\v 24 And Yahweh commandeth us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for good to ourselves all the days, to keep us alive, as at this day;
\v 25 and righteousness it is for us, when we observe to do all this command before Yahweh our God, as He had commanded us.
\c 7
\v 1 'When Yahweh your God did bring you in unto the land where you are going in to possess it, and He had cast out many nations from your presence, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations more numerous and mighty than you,
\v 2 and Yahweh your God had given them before you, and you hast smitten them — you will utterly devote them — you will not make with them a covenant, nor will you favour them.
\v 3 'And you will not join in marriage with them; your daughter you will not give to his son, and his daughter you will not take to your son,
\v 4 for he did turn aside your son from after Me, and they have served other gods, and the anger of Yahweh had burned against you, and had destroyed you hastily.
\v 5 'But thus you will to them: their altars you break down, and their standing pillars you shiver, and their shrines you cut down, and their graven images you burn with fire;
\v 6 for a holy people are you to Yahweh your God; on you had Yahweh your God fixed, to be to Him for a peculiar people, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the ground.
\v 7 Not because of your being more numerous than any of the peoples had Yahweh delighted in you, and fixeth on you, for you are the least of all the peoples,
\v 8 but because of Yahweh's loving you, and because of His keeping the oath which He had sworn to your fathers, had Yahweh brought you out by a strong hand, and did ransom you from a house of servants, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\v 9 And you hast known that Yahweh your God He is God, the faithful God, keeping the covenant, and the kindness, to those loving Him, and to those keeping His commands — to a thousand generations,
\v 10 and repaying to those hating Him, unto their face, to destroy them; He delaid not to him who is hating Him — unto his face, He repayeth to him — 
\v 11 and you hast kept the command, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I am commanding you to-day to do them.
\v 12 'And it had been, because you hear these judgments, and have kept, and done them, that Yahweh your God had kept to you the covenant and the kindness which He had sworn to your fathers,
\v 13 and had loved you, and blessed you, and multiplied you, and had blessed the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your ground, your corn, and your new wine, and yours oil, the increase of yours oxen, and the wealth of your flock, on the ground which He had sworn to your fathers to give to you.
\v 14 Blessed are you above all the peoples, there is not in you a barren man or a barren woman — nor among your cattle;
\v 15 and Yahweh had turned aside from you every sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which you hast known) did He put on you, and He had put them on all hating you.
\v 16 And you hast consumed all the peoples whom Yahweh your God is giving to you; yours eye had no pity on them, and you will not serve their gods, for a snare it is to you.
\v 17 When you sayest in yours heart, These nations are more numerous than I, how am I able to dispossess them? — 
\v 18 you are not afraid of them; you will surely remember that which Yahweh your God had done to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt,
\v 19 the great trials which yours eyes have seen, and the signs, and the wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched-out arm, with which Yahweh your God had brought you out; so did Yahweh your God to all the peoples of whose presence you are afraid.
\v 20 'And also the locust did Yahweh your God send among them, till the destruction of those who are left, and of those who are hidden from your presence;
\v 21 you are not terrified by their presence, for Yahweh your God is in your middle, a God great and fearful.
\v 22 And Yahweh your God had cast out these nations from your presence little by little, (you are not able to consume them hastily, lest the beast of the field multiply against you),
\v 23 and Yahweh your God had given them before you, and destroyed them — a great destruction — till their destruction;
\v 24 and He had given their kings into your hand, and you hast destroyed their name from under the heavens; no man did station himself in your presence till you hast destroyed them.
\v 25 The graven images of their gods you do burn with fire; you will not desire the silver and gold on them, nor hast you taken it to thyself, lest you be snared by it, for the abomination of Yahweh your God it is;
\v 26 and you will not bring in an abomination unto your house — or you hast been devoted like it; — you will utterly detest it, and you will utterly abominate it; for it is devoted.
\c 8
\v 1 'All the command which I am commanding you to-day you observe to do, so that you live, and have multiplied, and gone in, and possessed the land which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers;
\v 2 and you hast remembered all the way which Yahweh your God had caused you to go these forty years in the wilderness, in order to humble you to try you, to know that which is in your heart, whether you will keep His commands or not.
\v 3 'And He did humble you, and cause you to hunger and did cause you to eat the manna (which you hast not known, even your fathers have not known), in order to cause you to know that not by bread alone did man live, but by every produce of the mouth of Yahweh man did live.
\v 4 'Your raiment had not worn out from off you, and your foot had not swelled these forty years,
\v 5 and you hast known, with your heart, that as a man chastiseth his son Yahweh your God is chastising you,
\v 6 and you hast kept the commands of Yahweh your God, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him.
\v 7 'For Yahweh your God is bringing you in unto a good land, a land of brooks of waters, of fountains, and of depths coming out in valley and in mountain:
\v 8 a land of wheat, and barley, and vine, and fig, and pomegranate; a land of oil olive and honey;
\v 9 a land in which without scarcity you will eat bread, you will not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of its mountains you will dig brass;
\v 10 and you hast eaten, and been satisfied, and hast blessed Yahweh your God, on the good land which he had given to you.
\v 11 'Take heed to thyself, lest you forget Yahweh your God so as not to keep His commands, and His judgments, and His statutes which I am commanding you to-day;
\v 12 lest you eat, and hast been satisfied, and good houses will build, and hast inhabited;
\v 13 and your herd and your flock be multiplied, and silver and gold be multiplied to you; and all that is yours be multiplied:
\v 14 'And your heart had been high, and you hast forgotten Yahweh your God (who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants;
\v 15 who is causing you to go in the great and the terrible wilderness — burning serpent, and scorpion, and thirst — where there is no water; who is bringing out to you waters from the flinty rock;
\v 16 who is causing you to eat manna in the wilderness, which your fathers have not known, in order to humble you, and in order to try you, to do you good in your latter end),
\v 17 and you hast said in your heart, My power, and the might of my hand, had made for me this wealth:
\v 18 And you hast remembered Yahweh your God, for He it is who is giving to you power to make wealth, in order to establish His covenant which He had sworn to your fathers as at this day.
\v 19 And it had been — if you really forget Yahweh your God, and hast gone after other gods, and served them, and bowed thyself to them, I have testified against you to-day that you do utterly perish;
\v 20 as the nations whom Yahweh is destroying from your presence, so you perish; because you hearken not to the voice of Yahweh your God.
\c 9
\v 1 'Hear, Israel, you are passing over to-day the Jordan, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself; cities great and fenced in the heavens;
\v 2 a people great and tall, sons of Anakim, whom you — you hast known, (and you — you hast heard: Who did station himself before sons of Anak?)
\v 3 and you hast known to-day, that Yahweh your God is He who is passing over before you — a fire consuming; He did destroy them, and He did humble them before you, and you hast dispossessed them, and destroyed them hastily, as Yahweh had spoken to you.
\v 4 'You will not speak in your heart (in Yahweh your God's driving them away from before you), saying, For my righteousness had Yahweh brought me in to possess this land, seeing for the wickedness of these nations is Yahweh dispossessing them from your presence;
\v 5 not for your righteousness, and for the uprightness of your heart, are you going in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations is Yahweh your God dispossessing them from before you; and in order to establish the word which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;
\v 6 and you hast known, that not for your righteousness is Yahweh your God giving to you this good land to possess it, for a people stiff of neck you are.
\v 7 Remember — do not forget — that with which you hast made Yahweh your God wroth in the wilderness; even from the day that you hast come out of the land of Egypt till your coming in unto this place rebels you have been with Yahweh;
\v 8 even in Horeb you have made Yahweh wroth, and Yahweh sheweth Himself angry against you — to destroy you.
\v 9 'In my going up into the mount to receive the tables of stone (tables of the covenant which Yahweh had made with you), and I abide in the mount forty days and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk;
\v 10 and Yahweh gave unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them according to all the words which Yahweh had spoken with you in the mount, out of the middle of the fire, in the day of the assembly.
\v 11 And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, Yahweh had given unto me the two tables of stone — tables of the covenant,
\v 12 and Yahweh said unto me, Rise, go down, hasten from this, for your people had done corruptly, whom you hast brought out of Egypt; they have turned aside hastily out of the way which I have commanded them — they have made to themselves a molten thing!
\v 13 And Yahweh spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, a people stiff of neck it is;
\v 14 desist from Me, and I destroy them, and blot out their name from under the heavens, and I make you become a nation more mighty and numerous than it.
\v 15 'And I turn, and come down from the mount, and the mount is burning with fire, and the two tables of the covenant on my two hands,
\v 16 and I see, and behold, you have sinned against Yahweh your God; you have made to yourselves a molten calf; you have turned aside hastily out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
\v 17 'And I lay hold on the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and break them before your eyes,
\v 18 and I throw myself before Yahweh, as at first, forty days and forty nights; bread I have not eaten, and water I have not drunk, because of all your sins which you have sinned, by doing the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, to make Him angry.
\v 19 'For I have been afraid because of the anger and the fury with which Yahweh had been wroth against you, to destroy you; and Yahweh did hearken unto me also at this time.
\v 20 'And with Aaron had Yahweh showed himself very angry, to destroy him, and I pray also for Aaron at that time;
\v 21 and your sin, which you have made — the calf — I have taken, and I burn it with fire, and beat it, grinding well till that it is small as dust, and I cast its dust unto the brook which is going down out of the mount.
\v 22 'And in Taberah, and in Massah, and in Kibroth-Hattaavah, you have been making Yahweh wroth:
\v 23 and in Yahweh's sending you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, Go up, and possess the land which I have given to you, then you provoke the mouth of Yahweh your God, and have not given credence to Him, nor hearkened to His voice;
\v 24 rebels you have been with Yahweh from the day of my knowing you.
\v 25 And I throw myself before Yahweh, the forty days and the forty nights, as I had thrown myself, for Yahweh had said — to destroy you;
\v 26 and I pray unto Yahweh, and say, Lord Yahweh, destroy not Your people, and Thine inheritance, whom You hast ransomed in Your greatness; whom You hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand;
\v 27 be mindful of Your servants, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, turn not unto the stiffness of this people, and unto its wickedness, and unto its sin;
\v 28 lest the land say from which You hast brought us out, Because of Yahweh's want of ability to bring them in unto the land of which He had spoken to them, and because of His hating them, He brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness;
\v 29 and they are Your people, and Thine inheritance, whom You hast brought out by Your great power, and by Your stretched-out arm!
\c 10
\v 1 'At that time had Yahweh said unto me, Grave for you two tables of stone, like the first, and come up unto Me, into the mount, and you hast made for you an ark of wood,
\v 2 and I write on the tables the words which were on the first tables, which you hast broken, and you hast placed them in the ark;
\v 3 and I make an ark of shittim wood, and grave two tables of stone like the first, and go up to the mount, and the two tables in my hand.
\v 4 'And He writeth on the tables, according to the first writing, the Ten Matters, which Yahweh had spoken unto you in the mount, out of the middle of the fire, in the day of the assembly, and Yahweh gave them unto me,
\v 5 and I turn and come down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made, and they are there, as Yahweh commanded me.
\v 6 'And the sons of Israel have journeyed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Mosera, there Aaron died, and he is buried there, and Eleazar his son did act as priest in his stead;
\v 7 there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
\v 8 'At that time had Yahweh separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh, to serve Him, and to bless in His name, unto this day,
\v 9 therefore there had not been to Levi a portion and inheritance with his brethren; Yahweh Himself is his inheritance, as Yahweh your God had spoken to him.
\v 10 And I — I have stood in the mount, as the former days, forty days and forty nights, and Yahweh hearkeneth unto me also at that time; Yahweh had not willed to destroy you.
\v 11 'And Yahweh said unto me, Rise, go to journey before the people, and they go in and possess the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.
\v 12 'And now, Israel, what is Yahweh your God asking from you, except to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
\v 13 to keep the commands of Yahweh, and His statutes which I am commanding you to-day, for good to you?
\v 14 Lo, to Yahweh your God are the heavens and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that is in it;
\v 15 only in your fathers had Yahweh delighted — to love them, and He did fix on their seed after them — on you, out of all the peoples as at this day;
\v 16 and you have circumcised the foreskin of your heart, and your neck you do not harden any more;
\v 17 for Yahweh your God — He is God of the gods, and Lord of the lords; God, the great, the mighty, and the fearful; who accepteth not persons, nor took a bribe;
\v 18 He is doing the judgment of fatherless and widow, and loving the sojourner, to give to him bread and raiment.
\v 19 'And you have loved the sojourner, for sojourners you were in the land of Egypt.
\v 20 'Yahweh your God you will fear, Him you will serve, and to Him you will cleave, and by His name you will swear.
\v 21 He is your praise, and He is your God, who had done with you these great and fearful things which yours eyes have seen:
\v 22 with seventy persons did your fathers go down to Egypt, and now had Yahweh your God made you as stars of the heavens for multitude.
\c 11
\v 1 'And you hast loved Yahweh your God, and kept His charge, and His statutes, and His judgments, and His commands, all the days;
\v 2 and you have known to-day — for it is not your sons who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, His greatness, His strong hand, and His stretched-out arm,
\v 3 and His signs, and His doings, which He had done in the middle of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;
\v 4 and that which He had done to the force of Egypt, to its horses, and to its chariot, when He had caused the waters of the Red Sea to flow against their faces in their pursuing after them, and Yahweh destroyeth them, unto this day;
\v 5 and that which He had done to you in the wilderness, till your coming in unto this place;
\v 6 and that which He had done to Dathan, and to Abiram, sons of Eliab, sons of Reuben, when the earth had opened her mouth and swalloweth them, and their houses, and their tents, and all that lived, which is at their feet, in the middle of all Israel:
\v 7  — But it is your eyes which are seeing all the great work of Yahweh, which He had done;
\v 8 and you have kept all the command which I am commanding you to-day, so that you are strong, and have gone in, and possessed the land where you are passing over to possess it,
\v 9 and so that you prolong days on the ground which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers to give to them and to their seed — a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 10 'For the land where you are going in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt whence you have come out, where you sowest your seed, and hast watered with your foot, as a garden of the green herb;
\v 11 but the land where you are passing over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys; of the rain of the heavens it drinketh water;
\v 12 a land which Yahweh your God is searching; continually are the eyes of Yahweh your God upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the latter end of the year.
\v 13 And it had been — if you hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your soul — 
\v 14 that I have given the rain of your land in its season — sprinkling and gathered — and you hast gathered your corn, and your new wine, and yours oil,
\v 15 and I have given herbs in your field for your cattle, and you hast eaten, and been satisfied.
\v 16 'Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be enticed, and you have turned aside, and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them,
\v 17 and the anger of Yahweh had burned against you, and He had restrained the heavens, and there is no rain, and the ground did not give her increase, and you have perished hastily from off the good land which Yahweh is giving to you.
\v 18 'And you have placed these my words on your heart, and on your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and they have been for frontlets between your eyes;
\v 19 and you have taught them to your sons, by speaking of them in your sitting in your house, and in your going in the way, and in your lying down, and in your rising up,
\v 20 and hast written them on the side-posts of your house, and on your gates,
\v 21 so that your days are multiplied, and the days of your sons, on the ground which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers to give to them, as the days of the heavens on the earth.
\v 22 For, if you diligently keep all this command which I am commanding you — to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him,
\v 23 then had Yahweh dispossessed all these nations from before you, and you have possessed nations, greater and mightier than you;
\v 24 every place on which the sole of your foot treadeth is yours; from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Phrat, even unto the farther sea is your border;
\v 25 no man did station himself in your presence; your dread and your fear did Yahweh your God put on the face of all the land on which you tread, as He had spoken to you.
\v 26 'See, I am setting before you to-day a blessing and a reviling:
\v 27 the blessing, when you hearken unto the commands of Yahweh your God, which I am commanding you to-day;
\v 28 and the reviling, if you do not hearken unto the commands of Yahweh your God, and have turned aside out of the way which I am commanding you to-day, to go after other gods which you have not known.
\v 29 'And it had been, when Yahweh your God did bring you in unto the land where you are going in to possess it, that you hast given the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the reviling on mount Ebal;
\v 30 are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going in of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite, who is dwelling in the plain over-against Gilgal, near the oaks of Moreh?
\v 31 for you are passing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you; and you have possessed it, and dwelt in it,
\v 32 and observed to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you to day.
\c 12
\v 1 These are the statutes and the judgments which you observe to do in the land which Yahweh, God of your fathers, had given to you to possess it, all the days that you are living on the ground:
\v 2 you do utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you are dispossessing served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the heights, and under every green tree;
\v 3 and you have broken down their altars, and shivered their standing pillars, and their shrines you burn with fire, and graven images of their gods you cut down, and have destroyed their name out of that place.
\v 4 'Ye do not do so to Yahweh your God;
\v 5 but unto the place which Yahweh your God did choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, to His tabernacle you seek, and you hast entered thither,
\v 6 and hast brought in thither your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock;
\v 7 and you have eaten there before Yahweh your God, and have rejoiced in every putting forth of your hand, you and your households, with which Yahweh your God had blessed you.
\v 8 'Ye do not do according to all that we are doing here to-day, each anything that is right in his own eyes,
\v 9 for you have not come in hitherto unto the rest, and unto the inheritance, which Yahweh your God is giving to you;
\v 10 and you have passed over the Jordan, and have dwelt in the land which Yahweh your God is causing you to inherit, and He had given rest to you from all your enemies round about, and you have dwelt confidently:
\v 11 'And it had been, the place on which Yahweh your God did fix to cause His name to tabernacle there, thither you bring in all that which I am commanding you, your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all the choice of your vows which you vow to Yahweh;
\v 12 and you have rejoiced before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your handmaids, and the Levite who is within your gates, for he had no part and inheritance with you.
\v 13 'Take heed to you, lest you cause your burnt-offerings to ascend in any place which you seest,
\v 14 except in the place which Yahweh did choose in one of your tribes, there you will cause your burnt-offerings to ascend, and there you will do all that which I am commanding you.
\v 15 'Only, with all the desire of your soul you will sacrifice, and hast eaten flesh according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which He had given to you, in all your gates; the unclean and the clean do eat it, as of the roe, and as of the hart.
\v 16 Only, the blood you do not eat — on the earth you will pour it as water;
\v 17 you are not able to eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, and of your new wine, and yours oil, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock, and any of your vows which you vowest, and your free-will offerings, and heave-offering of your hand;
\v 18 but before Yahweh your God you will eat it, in the place which Yahweh your God did fix on, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your handmaid, and the Levite who is within your gates, and you hast rejoiced before Yahweh your God in every putting forth of your hand;
\v 19 take heed to you lest you forsake the Levite all your days on your ground.
\v 20 When Yahweh your God did enlarge your border, as He had spoken to you, and you hast said, Let me eat flesh — for your soul desireth to eat flesh — of all the desire of your soul you will eat flesh.
\v 21 'When the place is far from you which Yahweh your God did choose to put His name there, then you hast sacrificed of your herd and of your flock which Yahweh had given to you, as I have commanded you, and hast eaten within your gates, of all the desire of your soul;
\v 22 only, as the roe and the hart is eaten, so will you eat it; the unclean and the clean did alike eat it.
\v 23 Only, be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you will not eat the life with the flesh;
\v 24 you will not eat it, on the earth you will pour it as water;
\v 25 you will not eat it, in order that it may be well with you, and with your sons after you, when you will that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 26 'Only, your holy things which you hast, and your vows, you will take up, and hast gone in unto the place which Yahweh did choose,
\v 27 and you hast made your burnt-offerings — the flesh and the blood — on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your sacrifices is poured out by the altar of Yahweh your God, and the flesh you will eat.
\v 28 Observe, and you hast obeyed all these words which I am commanding you, in order that it may be well with you and with your sons after you — to the age, when you will that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
\v 29 When Yahweh your God did cut off the nations — where you are going in to possess them — from your presence, and you hast possessed them, and hast dwelt in their land — 
\v 30 take heed to you, lest you be snared after them, after their being destroyed out of your presence, and lest you enquire about their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods, and I do so — even I?
\v 31 'You will not do so to Yahweh your God; for every abomination of Yahweh which He is hating they have done to their gods, for even their sons and their daughters they burn with fire to their gods.
\v 32 The whole thing which I am commanding you — it you observe to do; you will not add unto it, nor diminish from it.
\c 13
\v 1 'When there ariseth in your middle a prophet, or a dreamer of a dream, and he had given unto you a sign or wonder,
\v 2 and the sign and the wonder had come which he had spoken of unto you, saying, Let us go after other gods (which you hast not known), and serve them,
\v 3 you will not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of the dream, for Yahweh your God is trying you, to know whether you are loving Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul;
\v 4 after Yahweh your God you walk, and Him you fear, and His commands you keep, and to His voice you hearken, and Him you serve, and to Him you cleave.
\v 5 'And that prophet, or that dreamer of the dream, is put to death, for he had spoken apostasy against Yahweh your God (who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, and had ransomed you out of a house of servants), to drive you out of the way in which Yahweh your God had commanded you to walk, and you hast put away the evil thing from your middle.
\v 6 When your brother — son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as yours own soul — did move you, in secret, saying, Let us go and serve other gods — (which you hast not known, you and your fathers,
\v 7 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, who are near unto you, or who are far off from you, from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth) — 
\v 8 you will not consent to him, nor hearken unto him, nor did yours eye have pity on him, nor will you spare, nor will you cover him over.
\v 9 'But you will surely kill him; your hand is on him, in the first place, to put him to death, and the hand of all the people last;
\v 10 and you hast stoned him with stones, and he had died, for he had sought to drive you away from Yahweh your God, who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants;
\v 11 and all Israel do hear and fear, and add not to do like this evil thing in your middle.
\v 12 When you hearest, in one of your cities which Yahweh your God is giving to you to dwell there, one saying,
\v 13 Men, sons of worthlessness, have gone out of your middle, and they force away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known — 
\v 14 and you hast enquired, and searched, and asked diligently, and behold, truth; the thing is established; this abomination had been done in your middle:
\v 15 You will surely smite the inhabitants of that city by the mouth of the sword; devoting it, and all that is in it, even its cattle, by the mouth of the sword;
\v 16 and all its spoil you will gather unto the middle of its broad place, and hast burned with fire the city and all its spoil completely, before Yahweh your God, and it had been a heap age-during, it is not built any more;
\v 17 and there did not cleave to your hand any of the devoted thing, so that Yahweh did turn back from the fierceness of His anger, and had given to you mercies, and loved you, and multiplied you, as He had sworn to your fathers,
\v 18 when you will hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all his commands which I am commanding you to-day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
\c 14
\v 1 Sons you are to Yahweh your God; you do not cut yourselves, nor make baldness between your eyes for the dead;
\v 2 for a holy people are you to Yahweh your God, and on you had Yahweh fixed to be to Him for a people, a peculiar treasure, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the ground.
\v 3 'You will not eat any abominable thing;
\v 4 this is the beast which you do eat: ox, lamb of the sheep, or kid of the goats,
\v 5 hart, and roe, and fallow deer, and wild goat, and pygarg, and wild ox, and chamois;
\v 6 and every beast dividing the hoof, and cleaving the cleft into two hoofs, bringing up the cud, among the beasts — it you do eat.
\v 7 Only, this you do not eat, of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the cloven hoof: the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit, for they are bringing up the cud but the hoof have not divided; unclean they are to you;
\v 8 and the sow, for it is dividing the hoof, and not bringing up the cud, unclean it is to you; of their flesh you do not eat, and against their carcase you do not come.
\v 9 This you do eat of all that are in the waters; all that had fins and scales you do eat;
\v 10 and anything which had not fins and scales you do not eat; unclean it is to you.
\v 11 'Any clean bird you do eat;
\v 12 and these are they of which you do not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
\v 13 and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after its kind,
\v 14 and every raven after its kind;
\v 15 and the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind;
\v 16 the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,
\v 17 and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant,
\v 18 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat;
\v 19 and every teeming thing which is flying, unclean it is to you; they are not eaten;
\v 20 any clean fowl you do eat.
\v 21 Ye do not eat of any carcase; to the sojourner who is within your gates you will give it, and he had eaten it; or sell it to a stranger; for a holy people you are to Yahweh your God; you will not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
\v 22 'You will certainly tithe all the increase of your seed which the field is bringing forth year by year;
\v 23 and you hast eaten before Yahweh your God, in the place where He did choose to cause His name to tabernacle, the tithe of your corn, of your new wine, and of yours oil, and the firstlings of your herd, and of your flock, so that you will learn to fear Yahweh your God all the days.
\v 24 And when the way is too much for you, that you are not able to carry it — when the place is too far off from you which Yahweh your God did choose to put His name there, when Yahweh your God did bless you; — 
\v 25 then you hast given it in money, and hast bound up the money in your hand, and gone unto the place on which Yahweh your God did fix;
\v 26 and you hast given the money for any thing which your soul desireth, for oxen, and for sheep, and for wine, and for strong drink, and for any thing which your soul asketh, and you hast eaten there before Yahweh your God, and you hast rejoiced, you and your house.
\v 27 As to the Levite who is within your gates, you will not forsake him, for he had no portion and inheritance with you.
\v 28 At the end of three years you will bring out all the tithe of yours increase in that year, and hast placed it within your gates;
\v 29 and come in had the Levite (for he had no part and inheritance with you), and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, and they have eaten, and been satisfied, so that Yahweh your God did bless you in all the work of your hand which you will.
\c 15
\v 1 'At the end of seven years you will make a release,
\v 2 and this is the matter of the release: Every owner of a loan is to release his hand which he did lift up against his neighbour, he did not exact of his neighbour and of his brother, but had proclaimed a release to Yahweh;
\v 3 of the stranger you may exact, and that which is yours with your brother did your hand release;
\v 4 only when there is no needy one with you, for Yahweh did greatly bless you in the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you — an inheritance to possess it.
\v 5 'Only, if you will diligently hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all this command which I am commanding you to-day,
\v 6 for Yahweh your God had blessed you as He had spoken to you; and you hast lent to many nations, and you hast not borrowed; and you hast ruled over many nations, and over you they do not rule.
\v 7 'When there is with you any needy one of one of your brethren, in one of your cities, in your land which Yahweh your God is giving to you, you will not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your needy brother;
\v 8 for you will certainly open your hand to him, and will certainly lend him sufficient for his lack which he lacketh.
\v 9 Take heed to you lest there be a word in your heart — worthless, saying, Near is the seventh year, the year of release; and yours eye is evil against your needy brother, and you will not give to him, and he had called concerning you unto Yahweh, and it had been in you sin;
\v 10 you will certainly give to him, and your heart is not sad in your giving to him, for because of this thing did Yahweh your God bless you in all your works, and in every putting forth of your hand;
\v 11 because the needy one did not cease out of the land, therefore I am commanding you, saying, You will certainly open your hand to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy one, in your land.
\v 12 When your brother is sold to you, a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, and he had served you six years — then in the seventh year you will send him away free from you.
\v 13 And when you will send him away free from you, you will not send him away empty;
\v 14 you will certainly encircle him out of your flock, and out of your threshing-floor, and out of your wine-vat; of that which Yahweh your God had blessed you you will give to him,
\v 15 and you hast remembered that a servant you hast been in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God did ransom you; therefore I am commanding you this thing to-day.
\v 16 And it had been, when he said unto you, I go not out from you — because he had loved you, and your house, because it is good for him with you — 
\v 17 then you hast taken the awl, and hast put it through his ear, and through the door, and he had been to you a servant age-during; and also to your handmaid you will do so.
\v 18 'It is not hard in yours eyes, in your sending him away free from you; for the double of the hire of an hireling he had served you six years, and Yahweh your God had blessed you in all that you will.
\v 19 Every firstling that is born in your herd and in your flock — the male you will sanctify to Yahweh your God; you will not work with the firstling of yours ox, nor shear the firstling of your flock;
\v 20 before Yahweh your God you will eat it year by year, in the place which Yahweh did choose, you and your house.
\v 21 'And when there is in it a blemish, lame, or blind, any evil blemish, you will not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God;
\v 22 within your gates you will eat it, the unclean and the clean alike, as the roe, and as the hart.
\v 23 Only, its blood you will not eat; on the earth you will pour it as water.
\c 16
\v 1 Observe the month of Abib — and you hast made a passover to Yahweh your God, for in the month of Abib had Yahweh your God brought you out of Egypt by night;
\v 2 and you hast sacrificed a passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock, and of the herd, in the place which Yahweh did choose to cause His name to tabernacle there.
\v 3 'You will not eat with it any fermented thing, seven days you will eat with it unleavened things, bread of affliction; for in haste you hast come out of the land of Egypt; so that you will remember the day of your coming out of the land of Egypt all days of your life;
\v 4 and there is not seen with you leaven in all your border seven days, and there did not remain of the flesh which you will sacrifice at evening on the first day till morning.
\v 5 'You are not able to sacrifice the passover within any of your gates which Yahweh your God is giving to you,
\v 6 except at the place which Yahweh your God did choose to cause His name to tabernacle — there you will sacrifice the passover in the evening, at the going in of the sun, the season of your coming out of Egypt;
\v 7 and you hast cooked and eaten in the place on which Yahweh your God did fix, and hast turned in the morning, and gone to your tents;
\v 8 six days you will eat unleavened things, and on the seventh day is a restraint to Yahweh your God; you will do no work.
\v 9 'Seven weeks you will number to you; from the beginning of the sickle among the standing corn you will begin to number seven weeks,
\v 10 and you hast made the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God, a tribute of a free-will offering of your hand, which you will give, as Yahweh your God did bless you.
\v 11 And you hast rejoiced before Yahweh your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your handmaid, and the Levite who is within your gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in your middle, in the place which Yahweh your God did choose to cause His name to tabernacle there,
\v 12 and you hast remembered that a servant you hast been in Egypt, and hast observed and done these statutes.
\v 13 'The feast of booths you will make for you seven days, in yours in-gathering of your threshing-floor, and of your wine-vat;
\v 14 and you hast rejoiced in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your handmaid, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates.
\v 15 Seven days you will feast before Yahweh your God, in the place which Yahweh did choose, for Yahweh your God did bless you in all yours increase, and in every work of your hands, and you hast been only rejoicing.
\v 16 Three times in a year did every one of your males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which He did choose — in the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths; and they do not appear before Yahweh empty;
\v 17 each according to the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God, which He had given to you.
\v 18 Judges and authorities you will make to you within all your gates which Yahweh your God is giving to you, for your tribes; and they have judged the people — a righteous judgment.
\v 19 You will not turn aside judgment; you will not discern faces, nor take a bribe, for the bribe blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
\v 20 Righteousness — righteousness you will pursue, so that you livest, and hast possessed the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you.
\v 21 'You will not plant for you a shrine of any trees near the altar of Yahweh your God, which you makest for thyself,
\v 22 and you will not raise up to you any standing image which Yahweh your God is hating.
\c 17
\v 1 You will not sacrifice to Yahweh your God ox or sheep in which there is a blemish — any evil thing; for it is the abomination of Yahweh your God.
\v 2 'When there is found in your middle, in one of your cities which Yahweh your God is giving to you, a man or a woman who did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh your God by transgressing His covenant,
\v 3 and he did go and serve other gods, and did bow himself to them, and to the sun, or to the moon, or to any of the host of the heavens, which I have not commanded — 
\v 4 and it had been declared to you, and you hast heard, and hast searched diligently, and behold, truth; the thing is established; this abomination had been done in Israel — 
\v 5 Then you hast brought out that man, or that woman, who had done this evil thing, unto your gates — the man or the woman — and you hast stoned them with stones, and they have died.
\v 6 By the mouth of two witnesses or of three witnesses is he who is dead put to death; he is not put to death by the mouth of one witness;
\v 7 the hand of the witnesses is on him, in the first place, to put him to death, and the hand of all the people last; and you hast put away the evil thing out of your middle.
\v 8 When anything is too hard for you for judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke — matters of strife within your gates — then you hast risen, and gone up unto the place on which Yahweh your God did fix,
\v 9 and hast come in unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge who is in those days, and hast inquired, and they have declared to you the word of judgment,
\v 10 and you hast done according to the tenor of the word which they declare to you (they of that place which Yahweh did choose; and you hast observed to do according to all that they direct you.
\v 11 'According to the tenor of the law which they direct you, and according to the judgment which they say to you you will do; you will not turn aside from the word which they declare to you, right or left.
\v 12 And the man who acteth with presumption, so as not to hearken unto the priest (who is standing to serve there Yahweh your God), or unto the judge, even that man had died, and you hast put away the evil thing from Israel,
\v 13 and all the people do hear and fear, and do not presume any more.
\v 14 When you comest in unto the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you, and hast possessed it, and dwelt in it, and you hast said, Let me set over me a king like all the nations which are round about me, — 
\v 15 you will certainly set over you a king on whom Yahweh did fix; from the middle of your brethren you will set over you a king; you are not able to set over you a stranger, who is not your brother.
\v 16 'Only, he did not multiply to himself horses, nor cause the people to turn back to Egypt, so as to multiply horses, seeing Yahweh had said to you, Ye do not add to turn back in this way any more.
\v 17 And he did not multiply to himself wives, and his heart did not turn aside, and silver and gold he did not multiply to himself — exceedingly.
\v 18 And it had been, when he sitteth on the throne of his kingdom, that he had written for himself the copy of this law, on a book, from that before the priests the Levites,
\v 19 and it had been with him, and he had read in it all days of his life, so that he did learn to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law, and these statutes, to do them;
\v 20 so that his heart is not high above his brethren, and so as not to turn aside from the command, right or left, so that he prolongeth days over his kingdom, he and his sons, in the middle of Israel.
\c 18
\v 1 There is not to the priests the Levites — all the tribe of Levi — a portion and inheritance with Israel; fire-offerings of Yahweh, even His inheritance, they eat,
\v 2 and he had no inheritance in the middle of his brethren; Yahweh Himself is his inheritance, as He had spoken to him.
\v 3 'And this is the priest's right from the people, from those sacrificing a sacrifice, whether ox or sheep, he had even given to the priest the leg, and the two cheeks, and the stomach;
\v 4 the first of your corn, of your new wine, and of yours oil, and the first of the fleece of your flock, you will give to him;
\v 5 for on him had Yahweh your God fixed, out of all your tribes, to stand to serve in the name of Yahweh, He and his sons continually.
\v 6 'And when the Levite came from one of your cities out of all Israel, where he had sojourned, and had come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Yahweh did choose,
\v 7 then he had ministered in the name of Yahweh his God, like all his brethren, the Levites, who are standing there before Yahweh,
\v 8 portion as portion they do eat, apart from his sold things, with the fathers.
\v 9 'When you are coming in unto the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you, you will not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations:
\v 10 there is not found in you one causing his son and his daughter to pass over into fire, a user of divinations, an observer of clouds, and an enchanter, and a sorcerer,
\v 11 and a charmer, and one asking at a familiar spirit, and a wizard, and one seeking unto the dead.
\v 12 For the abomination of Yahweh is every one doing these, and because of these abominations is Yahweh your God dispossessing them from your presence.
\v 13 Perfect you are with Yahweh your God,
\v 14 for these nations whom you are possessing, unto observers of clouds, and unto diviners, do hearken; and you — not so had Yahweh your God suffered you.
\v 15 A prophet out of your middle, out of your brethren, like to me, did Yahweh your God raise up to you — unto him you hearken;
\v 16 according to all that you did ask from Yahweh your God, in Horeb, in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not add to hear the voice of Yahweh my God, and this great fire let me not see any more, and I die not;
\v 17 and Yahweh said unto me, They have done well that they have spoken;
\v 18 a prophet I raise up to them, out of the middle of their brethren, like to you; and I have given my words in his mouth, and he had spoken unto them all that which I command him;
\v 19 and it had been — the man who did not hearken unto My words which he did speak in My name, I require it of him.
\v 20 Only, the prophet who presumeth to speak a word in My name — that which I have not commanded him to speak — and who spoke in the name of other gods — even that prophet had died.
\v 21 And when you sayest in your heart, How do we know the word which Yahweh had not spoken? — 
\v 22 that which the prophet spoke in the name of Yahweh, and the thing is not, and came not — it is the word which Yahweh had not spoken; in presumption had the prophet spoken it; — you are not afraid of him.
\c 19
\v 1 'When Yahweh your God did cut off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God is giving to you, and you hast succeeded them, and dwelt in their cities, and in their houses,
\v 2 three cities you will separate for you in the middle of your land which Yahweh your God is giving to you to possess it.
\v 3 You will prepare for you the way, and hast divided into three parts the border of your land which Yahweh your God did cause you to inherit, and it had been for the fleeing thither of every man-slayer.
\v 4 And this is the matter of the man-slayer who fleeth thither, and had lived: He who smiteth his neighbour unknowingly, and is not hating him heretofore,
\v 5 even he who came in with his neighbour into a forest to hew wood, and his hand had driven with an axe to cut the tree, and the iron had slipped from the wood, and had met his neighbour, and he had died — he did flee unto one of these cities, and had lived,
\v 6 lest the redeemer of blood pursue after the man-slayer when his heart is hot, and had overtaken him (because the way is great), and had smitten him — the life, and he had no sentence of death, for he is not hating him heretofore;
\v 7 therefore I am commanding you, saying, Three cities you will separate to you.
\v 8 And if Yahweh your God did enlarge your border, as He had sworn to your fathers, and had given to you all the land which He had spoken to give to your fathers — 
\v 9 when you keepest all this command to do it, which I am commanding you to-day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk in His ways all the days — then you hast added to you yet three cities to these three;
\v 10 and innocent blood is not shed in the middle of your land which Yahweh your God is giving to you — an inheritance, and there had been upon you blood.
\v 11 And when a man is hating his neighbour, and had lain in wait for him, and risen against him, and smitten him — the life, and he had died, and he had fled unto one of these cities,
\v 12 then the elders of his city have sent and taken him from there, and given him into the hand of the redeemer of blood, and he had died;
\v 13 yours eye had no pity on him, and you hast put away the innocent blood from Israel, and it is well with you.
\v 14 'You will not remove a border of your neighbour, which they of former times have made, in yours inheritance, which you will inherit in the land which Yahweh your God is giving to you to possess it.
\v 15 'One witness did not rise against a man for any iniquity, and for any sin, in any sin which he sinneth; by the mouth of two witnesses, or by the mouth of three witnesses, is a thing established.
\v 16 'When a violent witness did rise against a man, to testify against him apostasy,
\v 17 then have both the men who have the strife stood before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who are in those days,
\v 18 and the judges have searched diligently, and behold, the witness is a false witness, a falsehood he had testified against his brother:
\v 19 'Then you have done to him as he devised to do to his brother, and you hast put away the evil thing out of your middle,
\v 20 and those who are left do hear and fear, and add not to do any more according to this evil thing in your middle;
\v 21 and yours eye did not pity — life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
\c 20
\v 1 When you goest out to battle against yours enemy, and hast seen horse and chariot — a people more numerous than you — you are not afraid of them, for Yahweh your God is with you, who is bringing you up out of the land of Egypt;
\v 2 and it had been, in your drawing near unto the battle, that the priest had come nigh, and spoken unto the people,
\v 3 and said unto them, Hear, Israel, you are drawing near to-day to battle against your enemies, let not your hearts be tender, fear not, nor make haste, nor be terrified at their presence,
\v 4 for Yahweh your God is He who is going with you, to fight for you with your enemies — to save you.
\v 5 And the authorities have spoken unto the people, saying, Who is the man that had built a new house, and had not dedicated it? — let him go and turn back to his house, lest he die in battle, and another man dedicate it.
\v 6 And who is the man that had planted a vineyard, and had not made it common? — let him go and turn back to his house, lest he die in battle, and another man make it common.
\v 7 And who is the man that had betrothed a woman, and had not taken her? — let him go and turn back to his house, lest he die in battle, and another man take her.
\v 8 And the authorities have added to speak unto the people, and said, Who is the man that is afraid and tender of heart? — let him go and turn back to his house, and the heart of his brethren did not melt like his heart;
\v 9 and it had come to pass as the authorities finish to speak unto the people, that they have appointed princes of the hosts at the head of the people.
\v 10 'When you drawest near unto a city to fight against it, then you hast called unto it for Peace,
\v 11 and it had been, if Peace it answer you, and had opened to you, then it had come to pass — all the people who are found in it are to you for tributaries, and have served you.
\v 12 'And if it did not make peace with you, and had made with you war, then you hast laid siege against it,
\v 13 and Yahweh your God had given it into your hand, and you hast smitten every male of it by the mouth of the sword.
\v 14 Only, the women, and the infants, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, all its spoil, you will seize for thyself, and you hast eaten the spoil of yours enemies which Yahweh your God had given to you.
\v 15 So you will do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
\v 16 Only, of the cities of these peoples which Yahweh your God is giving to you for an inheritance, you will not keep alive any breathing;
\v 17 for you will certainly devote the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your God had commanded you,
\v 18 so that they teach you not to do according to all their abominations which they have done to their gods, and you have sinned against Yahweh your God.
\v 19 When you layest siege unto a city many days, to fight against it, to capture it, you will not destroy its trees to force an axe against them, for of them you will eat, and them you will not cut down — for man's is the tree of the field — to go in at your presence in the siege.
\v 20 Only, the tree, which you knowest that it is not a fruit-tree, it you will destroy, and hast cut down, and hast built a bulwark against the city which is making with you war till you hast subdued it.
\c 21
\v 1 When one is found killed on the ground which Yahweh your God is giving to you to possess it — fallen in a field — it is not known who had smitten him,
\v 2 then have yours elders and your judges gone out and measured unto the cities which are round about the killed one,
\v 3 and it had been, the city which is near unto the killed one, even the elders of that city have taken a heifer of the herd, which had not been wrought with, which had not drawn in the yoke,
\v 4 and the elders of that city have brought down the heifer unto a hard valley, which is not tilled nor sown, and have beheaded there the heifer in the valley.
\v 5 And the priests, sons of Levi, have come nigh — for on them had Yahweh your God fixed to serve Him, and to bless in the name of Yahweh, and by their mouth is every strife, and every stroke — 
\v 6 and all the elders of that city, who are near unto the killed one, do wash their hands over the heifer which is beheaded in the valley,
\v 7 and they have answered and said, Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not seen — 
\v 8 receive atonement for Your people Israel, whom You hast ransomed, O Yahweh, and suffer not innocent blood in the middle of Your people Israel; and the blood had been pardoned to them,
\v 9 and you will put away the innocent blood out of your middle, for you will that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 10 'When you goest out to battle against yours enemies, and Yahweh your God had given them into your hand, and you hast taken captive its captivity,
\v 11 and hast seen in the captivity a woman of fair form, and hast delighted in her, and hast taken to you for a wife,
\v 12 then you hast brought her in unto the middle of your household, and she had shaved her head, and prepared her nails,
\v 13 and turned aside the raiment of her captivity from off her, and had dwelt in your house, and bewailed her father and her mother a month of days, and afterwards you will go in unto her and hast married her, and she had been to you for a wife:
\v 14 And it had been — if you hast not delighted in her, that you hast sent her away at her desire, and you will not at all sell her for money; you will not tyrannize over her, because that you hast humbled her.
\v 15 'When a man had two wives, the one loved and the other hated, and they have borne to him sons (the loved one and the hated one), and the first-born son had been to the hated one;
\v 16 then it had been, in the day of his causing his sons to inherit that which he had, he is not able to declare first-born the son of the loved one, in the face of the son of the hated one — the first-born.
\v 17 But the first-born, son of the hated one, he did acknowledge, to give to him a double portion of all that is found with him, for he is the beginning of his strength; to him is the right of the first-born.
\v 18 When a man had a son apostatizing and rebellious — he is not hearkening to the voice of his father, and to the voice of his mother, and they have chastised him, and he did not hearken unto them — 
\v 19 then laid hold on him have his father and his mother, and they have brought him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place,
\v 20 and have said unto the elders of his city, Our son — this one — is apostatizing and rebellious; he is not hearkening to our voice — a glutton and drunkard;
\v 21 and all the men of his city have stoned him with stones, and he had died, and you hast put away the evil out of your middle, and all Israel do hear and fear.
\v 22 And when there is in a man a sin — a cause of death, and he had been put to death, and you hast hanged him on a tree,
\v 23 his corpse did not remain on the tree, for you will certainly bury him in that day — for a thing lightly esteemed of God is the hanged one — and you will not defile your ground which Yahweh your God is giving to you — an inheritance.

\v 3 and so you will to his ass, and so you will to his garment, and so you will to any lost thing of your brother's, which is lost by him, and you hast found it; you are not able to hide thyself.
\v 4 You will not see the ass of your brother, or his ox, falling in the way, and hast hid thyself from them; you will certainly raise them up with him.
\v 5 The habiliments of a man are not on a woman, nor did a man put on the garment of a woman, for the abomination of Yahweh your God is any one doing these.
\v 6 'When a bird's nest came before you in the way, in any tree, or on the earth, brood or eggs, and the mother sitting on the brood or on the eggs, you will not take the mother with the young ones;
\v 7 you will certainly send away the mother, and the young ones will take to thyself, so that it is well with you, and you hast prolonged days.
\v 8 'When you buildest a new house, then you hast made a parapet to your roof, and you will not put blood on your house when one falleth from it.

\v 13 'When a man took a wife, and had gone in unto her, and hated her,
\v 14 and laid against her actions of words, and brought out against her an evil name, and said, This woman I have taken, and I draw near unto her, and I have not found in her tokens of virginity:
\v 15 Then had the father of the damsel — and her mother — taken and brought out the tokens of virginity of the damsel unto the elders of the city in the gate,
\v 16 and the father of the damsel had said unto the elders, My daughter I have given to this man for a wife, and he did hate her;
\v 17 and behold, he had laid actions of words, saying, I have not found to your daughter tokens of virginity — and these are the tokens of the virginity of my daughter! and they have spread out the garment before the elders of the city.
\v 18 'And the elders of that city have taken the man, and chastise him,
\v 19 and fined him a hundred silverlings, and given to the father of the damsel, because he had brought out an evil name on a virgin of Israel, and she is to him for a wife, he is not able to send her away all his days.
\v 20 And if this thing had been truth — tokens of virginity have not been found for the damsel — 
\v 21 then they have brought out the damsel unto the opening of her father's house, and stoned her have the men of her city with stones, and she had died, for she had done folly in Israel, to go a-whoring in her father's house; and you hast put away the evil thing out of your middle.
\v 22 'When a man is found lying with a woman, married to a husband, then they have died even both of them, the man who is lying with the woman, also the woman; and you hast put away the evil thing out of Israel.
\v 23 'When there is a damsel, a virgin, betrothed to a man, and a man had found her in a city, and lain with her;
\v 24 then you have brought them both out unto the gate of that city, and stoned them with stones, and they have died: — the damsel, because that she had not cried, being in a city; and the man, because that he had humbled his neighbour's wife; and you hast put away the evil thing out of your middle.
\v 25 'And if in a field the man find the damsel who is betrothed, and the man had laid hold on her, and lain with her, then had the man who had lain with her died alone;
\v 26 and to the damsel you will not do anything, the damsel had no deadly sin; for as a man riseth against his neighbour and had murdered him — the life, so is this thing;
\v 27 for in a field he found her, she had cried — the damsel who is betrothed — and she had no saviour.
\v 28 'When a man finds a damsel, a virgin who is not betrothed, and had caught her, and lain with her, and they have been found,
\v 29 then had the man who is lying with her given to the father of the damsel fifty silverlings, and to him she is for a wife; because that he had humbled her, he is not able to send her away all his days.

\v 3 An Ammonite and a Moabite did not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even a tenth generation of them did not enter into the assembly of Yahweh — to the age;
\v 4 because that they have not come before you with bread and with water in the way, in your coming out from Egypt, and because he had hired against you Balaam son of Beor, of Pethor of Aram-Naharaim, to revile you;
\v 5 and Yahweh your God had not been willing to hearken unto Balaam, and Yahweh your God did turn for you the reviling to a blessing, because Yahweh your God had loved you;
\v 6 you will not seek their peace and their good all your days — to the age.
\v 7 You will not abominate an Edomite, for your brother he is; you will not abominate an Egyptian, for a sojourner you hast been in his land;
\v 8 sons who are begotten of them, a third generation of them, did enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 9 'When a camp went out against yours enemies, then you hast kept from every evil thing.
\v 10 When there is in you a man who is not clean, from an accident at night — then he had gone out unto the outside of the camp — he did not come in unto the middle of the camp — 
\v 11 and it had been, at the turning of the evening, he did bathe with water, and at the going in of the sun he did come in unto the middle of the camp.

\v 13 and a nail you hast on your staff, and it had been, in your sitting without, that you hast digged with it, and turned back, and covered your filth;
\v 14 for Yahweh your God is walking up and down in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give yours enemies before you, and your camp had been holy, and He did not see in you the nakedness of anything, and had turned back from after you.

\v 20 To a stranger you may lend in usury, and to your brother you will not lend in usury, so that Yahweh your God did bless you in every putting forth of your hand on the land where you goest in to possess it.
\v 21 When you vowest a vow to Yahweh your God, you will not delay to complete it; for Yahweh your God did certainly require it from you, and it had been in you — sin.
\v 22 'And when you forbearest to vow, it is not in you a sin.
\v 23 The produce of your lips you will keep, and hast done it, as you hast vowed to Yahweh your God; a free-will-offering, which you hast spoken with your mouth.

\v 1 When a man did take a wife, and had married her, and it had been, if she did not find grace in his eyes (for he had found in her nakedness of anything), and he had written for her a writing of divorce, and given it into her hand, and sent her out of his house,
\v 2 and she had gone out of his house, and had gone and been another man's,
\v 3 and the latter man had hated her, and written for her a writing of divorce, and given it into her hand, and sent her out of his house, or when the latter man dieth, who had taken her to himself for a wife:
\v 4 Her former husband who sent her away is not able to turn back to take her to be to him for a wife, after that she had become defiled; for an abomination it is before Yahweh, and you will not cause the land to sin which Yahweh your God is giving to you — an inheritance.
\v 5 When a man took a new wife, he did not go out into the host, and one did not pass over unto him for anything; free he is at his own house one year, and had rejoiced his wife whom he had taken.
\v 6 None did take in pledge millstones, and rider, for life it is he is taking in pledge.

\v 41 'Sons and daughters you will beget, and they are not with you, for they go into captivity;
\v 42 all your trees and the fruit of your ground did the locust possess;
\v 43 the sojourner who is in your middle went up above you very high, and you goest down very low;
\v 44 he did lend to you, and you will not lend to him; he is for head, and you are for tail.
\v 45 'And come upon you have all these curses, and they have pursued you, and overtaken you, till you are destroyed, because you hast not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep His commands, and His statutes, which he had commanded you;
\v 46 and they have been on you for a sign and for a wonder, also on your seed — to the age.
\v 47 Because that you hast not served Yahweh your God with joy, and with gladness of heart, because of the abundance of all things — 
\v 48 you hast served yours enemies, whom Yahweh sent against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in lack of all things; and he had put a yoke of iron on your neck, till He had destroyed you.
\v 49 'Yahweh did lift up against you a nation, from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle it flieth; a nation whose tongue you hast not heard,
\v 50 a nation — fierce of countenance — which accepteth not the face of the aged, and the young did not favour;
\v 51 and it had eaten the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your ground, till you are destroyed; which leaveth not to you corn, new wine, and oil, increase of yours oxen, and wealth of your flock, till it had destroyed you.
\v 52 'And it had laid siege to you in all your gates, till your walls come down, the high and the fenced ones in which you are trusting, in all your land; yea, it had laid siege to you in all your gates, in all your land, which Yahweh your God had given to you;
\v 53 and you hast eaten the fruit of your body, flesh of your sons and your daughters (whom Yahweh your God had given to you), in the siege, and in the straitness with which yours enemies do straiten you.
\v 54 The man who is tender in you, and who is very delicate — his eye is evil against his brother, and against the wife of his bosom, and against the remnant of his sons whom he leaveth,
\v 55 against giving to one of them of the flesh of his sons whom he eateth, because he had nothing left to him, in the siege, and in the straitness with which yours enemy did straiten you in all your gates.
\v 56 The tender woman in you, and the delicate, who had not tried the sole of her foot to place on the ground because of delicateness and because of tenderness — her eye is evil against the husband of her bosom, and against her son, and against her daughter,
\v 57 and against her seed which came out from between her feet, even against her sons whom she did bear, for she did eat them for the lacking of all things in secret, in the siege and in the straitness with which yours enemy did straiten you within your gates.
\v 58 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law which are written in this book, to fear this honoured and fearful name — Yahweh your God — 
\v 59 then had Yahweh made wonderful your strokes, and the strokes of your seed — great strokes, and stedfast, and evil sicknesses, and stedfast.
\v 60 'And He had brought back on you all the diseases of Egypt, of the presence of which you hast been afraid, and they have cleaved to you;
\v 61 also every sickness and every stroke which is not written in the book of this law; Yahweh did cause them to go up upon you till you are destroyed,
\v 62 and you have been left with few men, instead of which you have been as stars of the heavens for multitude, because you hast not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh your God.
\v 63 'And it had been, as Yahweh had rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so did Yahweh rejoice over you to destroy you, and to lay you waste; and you have been pulled away from off the ground where you are going in to possess it;
\v 64 and Yahweh had scattered you among all the peoples, from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth; and you hast served there other gods which you hast not known, you and your fathers — wood and stone.
\v 65 'And among those nations you will not rest, yea, there is no resting-place for the sole of your foot, and Yahweh had given to you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and grief of soul;
\v 66 and your life had been hanging in suspense before you, and you hast been afraid by night and by day, and will not believe in your life;
\v 67 in the morning you sayest, O that it were evening! and in the evening you sayest, O that it were morning! from the fear of your heart, with which you are afraid, and from the sight of yours eyes which you seest.
\v 68 'And Yahweh had brought you back to Egypt with ships, by a way of which I said to you, You will not add any more to see it, and you have sold yourselves there to yours enemies, for men-servants and for maid-servants, and there is no buyer.'
\c 29
\v 1 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh had commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, apart from the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.
\v 2 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, 'Ye — you have seen all that which Yahweh had done before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
\v 3 the great trials which yours eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders;
\v 4 and Yahweh had not given to you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, till this day,
\v 5 and I cause you to go forty years in a wilderness; your garments have not been consumed from off you, and your shoe had not worn away from off your foot;
\v 6 bread you have not eaten, and wine and strong drink you have not drunk, so that you know that I am Yahweh your God.
\v 7 And you come in unto this place, and Sihon king of Heshbon — also Og king of Bashan — did come out to meet us, to battle, and we smite them,
\v 8 and take their land, and give it for an inheritance to the Reubenite, and to the Gadite, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh;
\v 9 and you have kept the words of this covenant, and done them, so that you cause all that you do to prosper.
\v 10 Ye are standing to-day, all of you, before Yahweh your God — your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your authorities — every man of Israel;
\v 11 your infants, your wives, and your sojourner who is in the middle of your camps, from the hewer of your wood unto the drawer of your water — 
\v 12 for your passing over into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into His oath which Yahweh your God is making with you to-day;
\v 13 in order to establish you to-day to Him for a people, and He Himself is your God, as He had spoken to you, and as He had sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\v 14 'And not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath;
\v 15 but with him who is here with us, standing to-day before Yahweh our God, and with him who is not here with us to-day,
\v 16 for you have known how you dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we passed by through the middle of the nations which you have passed by;
\v 17 and you see their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them,
\v 18 lest there be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart is turning to-day from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations, lest there be in you a root fruitful of gall and wormwood:
\v 19 'And it had been, in his hearing the words of this oath, and he had blessed himself in his heart, saying, I have peace, though in the stubbornness of my heart I go on, in order to end the fulness with the thirst.
\v 20 Yahweh is not willing to be propitious to him, for then did the anger of Yahweh smoke, also His zeal, against that man, and lain down on him had all the oath which is written in this book, and Yahweh had blotted out his name from under the heavens,
\v 21 and Yahweh had separated him for evil, out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the oaths of the covenant which is written in this book of the law.
\v 22 And the latter generation of your sons who rise after you, and the stranger who came in from a land afar off, have said when they have seen the strokes of that land, and its sicknesses which Yahweh had sent into it, — 
\v 23 (with brimstone and salt is the whole land burnt, it is not sown, nor did it shoot up, nor did there go up on it any herb, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which Yahweh overturned in His anger, and in His fury,) — 
\v 24 yea, all the nations have said, Wherefore had Yahweh done thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?
\v 25 'And they have said, Because that they have forsaken the covenant of Yahweh, God of their fathers, which He made with them in His bringing them out of the land of Egypt,
\v 26 and they go and serve other gods, and bow themselves to them — gods which they have not known, and which He had not apportioned to them;
\v 27 and the anger of Yahweh burneth against that land, to bring in on it all the reviling that is written in this book,
\v 28 and Yahweh did pluck them from off their ground in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath, and did cast them unto another land, as at this day.
\v 29 The things hidden are to Yahweh our God, and the things revealed are to us and to our sons — to the age, to do all the words of this law.
\c 30
\v 1 And it had been, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the reviling, which I have set before you, and you hast brought them back unto your heart, among all the nations where Yahweh your God had driven you away,
\v 2 and hast turned back unto Yahweh your God, and hearkened to His voice, according to all that I am commanding you to-day, you and your sons, with all your heart, and with all your soul — 
\v 3 then had Yahweh your God turned back to your captivity, and pitied you, yea, He had turned back and gathered you out of all the peoples where Yahweh your God had scattered you.
\v 4 'If yours outcast is in the extremity of the heavens, there did Yahweh your God gather you, and there He did take you;
\v 5 and Yahweh your God had brought you in unto the land which your fathers have possessed, and you hast inherited it, and He had done you good, and multiplied you above your fathers.
\v 6 'And Yahweh your God had circumcised your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, for the sake of your life;
\v 7 and Yahweh your God had put all this oath on yours enemies, and on those hating you, who have pursued you.
\v 8 'And you will turn back, and hast hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, and hast done all His commands which I am commanding you to-day;
\v 9 and Yahweh your God had made you abundant in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, for good; for Yahweh turneth back to rejoice over you for good, as He rejoiced over your fathers,
\v 10 for you will hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep His commands, and His statutes, which are written in the book of this law, for you turnest back unto Yahweh your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul.
\v 11 For this command which I am commanding you to-day, it is not too wonderful for you, nor is it far off.
\v 12 It is not in the heavens, — saying, Who did go up for us into the heavens, and did take it for us, and did cause us to hear it — that we may do it.
\v 13 And it is not beyond the sea, — saying, Who did pass over for us beyond the sea, and did take it for us, and did cause us to hear it — that we may do it?
\v 14 For very near unto you is the word, in your mouth, and in your heart — to do it.
\v 15 'See, I have set before you to-day life and good, and death and evil,
\v 16 in that I am commanding you to-day to love Yahweh your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments; and you hast lived and multiplied, and Yahweh your God had blessed you in the land where you are going in to possess it.
\v 17 'And if your heart did turn, and you will not hearken, and hast been driven away, and hast bowed thyself to other gods, and served them,
\v 18 I have declared to you this day, that you do certainly perish, you do not prolong days on the ground which you are passing over the Jordan to go in thither to possess it.
\v 19 'I have caused to testify against you to-day the heavens and the earth; life and death I have set before you, the blessing and the reviling; and you hast fixed on life, so that you will live, you and your seed,
\v 20 to love Yahweh your God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him (for He is your life, and the length of your days), to dwell on the ground which Yahweh had sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them.'
\c 31
\v 1 And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel,
\v 2 and he said unto them, 'A son of a hundred and twenty years am I to-day; I am not able any more to go out and to come in, and Yahweh had said unto me, You will not pass over this Jordan,
\v 3 Yahweh your God He is passing over before you, He did destroy these nations from before you, and you hast possessed them; Joshua — he is passing over before you as Yahweh had spoken,
\v 4 and Yahweh had done to them as he had done to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorite, and to their land, whom He destroyed.
\v 5 And Yahweh had given them before your face, and you have done to them according to all the command which I have commanded you;
\v 6 be strong and courageous, fear not, nor be terrified because of them, for Yahweh your God is He who is going with you; He did not fail you nor forsake you.'
\v 7 And Moses called for Joshua, and said unto him before the eyes of all Israel, 'Be strong and courageous, for you — you will go in with this people unto the land which Yahweh had sworn to their fathers to give to them, and you — you will cause them to inherit it;
\v 8 and Yahweh is He who is going before you, He himself is with you; He did not fail you nor forsake you; fear not, nor be frightened.'
\v 9 And Moses writeth this law, and gave it unto the priests (sons of Levi, those bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh), and unto all the elders of Israel,
\v 10 and Moses commandeth them, saying, 'At the end of seven years, in the appointed time, the year of release, in the feast of booths,
\v 11 in the coming in of all Israel to see the face of Yahweh in the place which He chooseth, you will proclaim this law before all Israel, in their ears.
\v 12 Assemble the people, the men, and the women, and the infants, and your sojourner who is within your gates, so that they hear, and so that they learn, and have feared Yahweh your God, and observed to do all the words of this law;
\v 13 and their sons, who have not known, do hear, and have learned to fear Yahweh your God all the days which you are living on the ground where you are passing over the Jordan to possess it.'
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Lo, your days have drawn near to die; call Joshua, and station yourselves in the tent of meeting, and I charge him;' and Moses went — Joshua also — and they station themselves in the tent of meeting,
\v 15 and Yahweh is seen in the tent, in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud standeth at the opening of the tent.
\v 16 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Lo, you are lying down with your fathers, and this people had risen, and gone a-whoring after the gods of the stranger of the land into the middle of which it had entered, and forsaken Me, and broken My covenant which I made with it;
\v 17 and Mine anger had burned against it in that day, and I have forsaken them, and hidden My face from them, and it had been for consumption, and many evils and distresses have found it, and it had said in that day, Is it not because that my God is not in my middle — these evils have found me?
\v 18 and I certainly hide My face in that day for all the evil which it had done, for it had turned unto other gods.
\v 19 'And now, write for you this song, and teach it the sons of Israel; put it in their mouths, so that this song is to Me for a witness against the sons of Israel,
\v 20 and I bring them in unto the ground which I have sworn to their fathers — flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten, and been satisfied, and been fat, and have turned unto other gods, and they have served them, and despised Me, and broken My covenant.
\v 21 'And it had been, when many evils and distresses do meet it, that this song had testified to its face for a witness; for it is not forgotten out of the mouth of its seed, for I have known its imagining which it is doing to-day, before I bring them in unto the land of which I have sworn.'
\v 22 And Moses writeth this song on that day, and did teach it the sons of Israel,
\v 23 and He commandeth Joshua son of Nun, and said, 'Be strong and courageous, for you will bring in the sons of Israel unto the land which I have sworn to them, and I — I am with you.'
\v 24 And it came to pass, when Moses finisheth to write the words of this law on a book till their completion,
\v 25 that Moses commandeth the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,
\v 26 'Take this Book of the Law, and you hast set it on the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and it had been there against you for a witness;
\v 27 for I — I have known your rebellion, and your stiff neck; behold, in my being yet alive with you to-day, rebellious you have been with Yahweh, and also surely after my death.
\v 28 'Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your authorities, and I speak in their ears these words, and cause to testify against them the heavens and the earth,
\v 29 for I have known that after my death you do very corruptly, and have turned aside out of the way which I commanded you, and evil had met you in the latter end of the days, because you do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, to make Him angry with the work of your hands.'
\v 30 And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, till their completion: — 
\c 32
\v 1 'Give ear, O heavens, and I speak; And you will hear, O earth, sayings of my mouth!
\v 2 Drop as rain did My doctrine; Flow as dew did My sayings; As storms on the tender grass, And as showers on the herb,
\v 3 For the Name of Yahweh I proclaim, Ascribe you greatness to our God!
\v 4 The Rock! — perfect is His work, For all His ways are just; God of stedfastness, and without iniquity: Righteous and upright is He.
\v 5 It had done corruptly to Him; Their blemish is not His sons', A generation perverse and crooked!
\v 6 To Yahweh do you act thus, O people foolish and not wise? Is not He your father — your possessor? He made you, and did establish you.
\v 7 Remember days of old — Understand the years of many generations — Ask your father, and he did tell you; Thine elders, and they say to you:
\v 8 In the Most High causing nations to inherit, In His separating sons of Adam — He setteth up the borders of the peoples By the number of the sons of Israel.
\v 9 For Yahweh's portion is His people, Jacob is the line of His inheritance.
\v 10 He finds him in a land — a desert, And in a void — a howling wilderness, He turneth him round — He caused him to understand — He keepeth him as the apple of His eye.
\v 11 As an eagle waketh up its nest, Over its young ones fluttereth, Spreadeth its wings — took them, Beareth them on its pinions; — 
\v 12 Yahweh alone did lead him, And there is no strange god with him.
\v 13 He made him ride on high places of earth, And he eateth increase of the fields, And He made him suck honey from a rock, And oil out of the flint of a rock;
\v 14 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, and rams, sons of Bashan, And he-goats, with fat of kidneys of wheat; And of the blood of the grape you will drink wine!
\v 15 And Jeshurun waxeth fat, and did kick: You hast been fat — you hast been thick, You hast been covered. And he leaveth God who made him, And dishonoureth the Rock of his salvation.
\v 16 They make Him zealous with strangers, With abominations they make Him angry.
\v 17 They sacrifice to demons — no god! Gods they have not known — New ones — from the vicinity they came; Not feared them have your fathers!
\v 18 The Rock that begat you you forgettest, And neglectest God who formed you.
\v 19 And Yahweh saw and despiseth — For the provocation of His sons and His daughters.
\v 20 And He said: I hide My face from them, I see what is their latter end; For a froward generation are they, Sons in whom is no stedfastness.
\v 21 They have made Me zealous by 'no-god,' They made Me angry by their vanities; And I make them zealous by 'no-people,' By a foolish nation I make them angry.
\v 22 For a fire had been kindled in Mine anger, And it burneth unto Sheol — the lowest, And consumeth earth and its increase, And setteth on fire foundations of mountains.
\v 23 I gather upon them evils, Mine arrows I consume upon them.
\v 24 Exhausted by famine, And consumed by heat, and bitter destruction. And the teeth of beasts I send upon them, With poison of fearful things of the dust.
\v 25 Without bereave did the sword, And at the inner-chambers — fear, Both youth and virgin, Suckling with man of grey hair.
\v 26 I have said: I blow them away, I cause their remembrance to cease from man;
\v 27 If not — the anger of an enemy I fear, Lest their adversaries know — Lest they say, Our hand is high, And Yahweh had not wrought all this.
\v 28 For a nation lost to counsels are they, And there is no understanding in them.
\v 29 If they were wise — They deal wisely with this; They attend to their latter end:
\v 30 How did one pursue a thousand, And two cause a myriad to flee! If not — that their rock had sold them, And Yahweh had shut them up?
\v 31 For not as our Rock is their rock, (And our enemies are judges!)
\v 32 For of the vine of Sodom their vine is, And of the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of gall — They have bitter clusters;
\v 33 The poison of dragons is their wine And the fierce venom of asps.
\v 34 Is it not laid up with Me? Sealed among My treasures?
\v 35 Mine are vengeance and recompense, At the due time — did their foot slide; For near is a day of their calamity, And haste do things prepared for them.
\v 36 For Yahweh did judge His people, And for His servants did repent Himself. For He saw — the going away of power, And none is restrained and left.
\v 37 And He had said, Where are their gods — The rock in which they trusted;
\v 38 Which the fat of their sacrifices do eat, They drink the wine of their libation! Let them arise and help you, Let it be for you a hiding-place!
\v 39 See you, now, that I — I am He, And there is no god with Me: I put to death, and I keep alive; I have smitten, and I heal; And there is not from My hand a deliverer,
\v 40 For I lift up unto the heavens My hand, And have said, I live — to the age!
\v 41 If I have sharpened the brightness of My sword, And My hand did lay hold on judgment, I turn back vengeance to Mine adversaries, And to those hating Me — I repay!
\v 42 I make drunk Mine arrows with blood, And My sword devoureth flesh, From the blood of the pierced and captive, From the head of the freemen of the enemy.
\v 43 Sing you nations — with his people, For the blood of His servants He avengeth, And vengeance He turneth back on His adversaries, And had pardoned His land — His people.'
\v 44 And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea son of Nun;
\v 45 and Moses finisheth to speak all these words unto all Israel,
\v 46 and said unto them, 'Set your heart to all the words which I am testifying against you to-day, that you command your sons to observe to do all the words of this law,
\v 47 for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your life, and by this thing you prolong days on the ground where you are passing over the Jordan to possess it.'
\v 48 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, in this self-same day, saying,
\v 49 Go up unto this mount Abarim, mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, which is on the front of Jericho, and see the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession;
\v 50 and die in the mount where you are going up, and be gathered unto your people, as Aaron your brother had died in the mount Hor, and is gathered unto his people:
\v 51 Because you trespassed against me in the middle of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribath-Kadesh, the wilderness of Zin — because you sanctified Me not in the middle of the sons of Israel;
\v 52 but over-against you seest the land, and thither you will not go in, unto the land which I am giving to the sons of Israel.'
\c 33
\v 1 And this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death,
\v 2 and he said: — 'Yahweh from Sinai had come, And had risen from Seir for them; He had shone from mount Paran, And had come with myriads of holy ones; At His right hand are springs for them.
\v 3 Also He is loving the peoples; All His holy ones are in your hand, And they — they sat down at your foot, Each He lifteth up at your words.
\v 4 A law had Moses commanded us, A possession of the assembly of Jacob.
\v 5 And he is in Jeshurun king, In the heads of the people gathering together, The tribes of Israel!
\v 6 Let Reuben live, and not die, And let his men be a number.
\v 7 And this is for Judah; and he said: — Hear, O Yahweh, the voice of Judah, And unto his people do You bring him in; His hand had striven for him, And an help from his adversaries are You.
\v 8 And of Levi he said: — Your Thummim and your Urim are for your pious one, Whom You hast tried in Massah, You will strive with Him at the waters of Meribah;
\v 9 Who is saying of his father and his mother, I have not seen him; And his brethren he had not discerned, And his sons he had not known; For they have observed Your saying, And Your covenant they keep.
\v 10 They teach Your judgments to Jacob, And Your law to Israel; They put perfume in Your nose, And whole burnt-offering on Thine altar.
\v 11 Bless, O Yahweh, his strength, And the work of his hands You acceptest, Smite the loins of his withstanders, And of those hating him — that they rise not!
\v 12 Of Benjamin he said: — The beloved of Yahweh did tabernacle confidently by him, Covering him over all the day; Yea, between his shoulders He did tabernacle.
\v 13 And of Joseph he said: — Blessed of Yahweh is his land, By precious things of the heavens, By dew, and by the deep crouching beneath,
\v 14 And by precious things — fruits of the sun, And by precious things — cast forth by the moons,
\v 15 And by chief things — of the ancient mountains, And by precious things — of the age-during heights,
\v 16 And by precious things — of earth and its fulness, And the good pleasure Of Him who is dwelling in the bush, — Let it come for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of him Who is separate from his brethren.
\v 17 His honour is a firstling of his ox, And his horns are horns of a reem; By them peoples he did push together To the ends of earth; And they are the myriads of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
\v 18 And of Zebulun he said: — Rejoice, O Zebulun, in your going out, And, O Issachar, in your tents;
\v 19 Peoples to the mountain they call, There they sacrifice righteous sacrifices; For the abundance of the seas they suck, And hidden things hidden in the sand.
\v 20 And of Gad he said: — Blessed of the Enlarger is Gad, As a lioness he did tabernacle, And had torn the arm — also the crown!
\v 21 And he provideth the first part for himself, For there the portion of the lawgiver is covered, And he came with the heads of the people; The righteousness of Yahweh he had done, And His judgments with Israel.
\v 22 And of Dan he said: — Dan is a lion's whelp; he did leap from Bashan.
\v 23 And of Naphtali he said: — O Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, And full of the blessing of Yahweh, West and south possess you.
\v 24 And of Asher he said: — Blessed with sons is Asher, Let him be accepted by his brethren, And dipping in oil his foot.
\v 25 Iron and brass are your shoes, And as your days — your strength.
\v 26 There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Riding the heavens in your help, And in His excellency the skies.
\v 27 A habitation is the eternal God, And beneath are arms age-during. And He threw out from your presence the enemy, and said, 'Destroy!'
\v 28 And Israel did tabernacle in confidence alone; The eye of Jacob is unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens drop down dew.
\v 29 O your happiness, O Israel! who is like you? A people saved by Yahweh, The shield of your help, And He who is the sword of yours excellency: And yours enemies are subdued for you, And you on their high places will tread.'
\c 34
\v 1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, the top of Pisgah, which is on the front of Jericho, and Yahweh sheweth him all the land — Gilead unto Dan,
\v 2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the further sea,
\v 3 and the south, and the circuit of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, unto Zoar.
\v 4 And Yahweh said unto him, 'This is the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I give it; I have caused you to see with yours eyes, and thither you will not pass over.'
\v 5 And Moses, servant of the Lord, dieth there, in the land of Moab, according to the command of Yahweh;
\v 6 and He burieth him in a valley in the land of Moab, over-against Beth-Peor, and no man had known his burying place unto this day.
\v 7 And Moses is a son of a hundred and twenty years when he dieth; his eye had not become dim, nor had his moisture fled.
\v 8 And the sons of Israel bewail Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses are completed.
\v 9 And Joshua son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him, and the sons of Israel hearken unto him, and do as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 10 And there had not arisen a prophet any more in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh had known face unto face,
\v 11 in reference to all the signs and the wonders which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
\v 12 and in reference to all the strong hand, and to all the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
