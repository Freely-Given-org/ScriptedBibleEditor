\v 1 The burden of a word of Yahweh unto Israel by the hand of Malachi:
\v 2 I have loved you, said Yahweh, And you have said, 'In what hast You loved us?'
\v 3 Is not Esau Jacob's brother? — an affirmation of Yahweh, And I love Jacob, and Esau I have hated, And I make his mountains a desolation, And his inheritance for dragons of a wilderness.
\v 4 Because Edom said, 'We have been made poor, And we turn back and we build the wastes,' Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: They do build, and I do destroy, And men have called to them, 'O region of wickedness,' 'O people whom Yahweh defied to the age.'
\v 5 And your eyes do see, and you say, 'Magnified is Yahweh beyond the border of Israel,
\v 6 A son honoureth a father, and a servant his master. And if I am a father, where is Mine honour? And if I am a master, where is My fear? Said Yahweh of Hosts to you, O priests, despising My name! And you have said: 'In what have we despised Your name?'
\v 7 Ye are bringing nigh on Mine altar polluted bread, And you have said: 'In what have we polluted Thee?' In your saying: 'The table of Yahweh — it is despicable,'
\v 8 And when you bring nigh the blind for sacrifice, 'There is no evil,' And when you bring nigh the lame and sick, 'There is no evil;' Bring it near, I pray you, to your governor — Doth he accept you? or did he lift up your face? Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 9 And now, appease, I pray you, the face of God, And He did favour us; From your own hand had this been, Doth He accept of you appearances? Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 10 Who is even among you, And he shutteth the two-leaved doors? Yea, you do not kindle Mine altar for nought, I have no pleasure in you, said Yahweh of Hosts, And a present I do not accept of your hand.
\v 11 For, from the rising of the sun to its going in, Great is My name among nations, And in every place perfume is brought nigh to My name, and a pure present, For great is My name among nations, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 12 And you are polluting it in your saying, 'The table of Yahweh — it is polluted, As to its fruit — despicable is its food.'
\v 13 And you have said, 'Lo, what a weariness,' And you have puffed at it, said Yahweh of Hosts, And you have brought in plunder, And the lame and the sick, And you have brought in the present! Do I accept it from your hand? said Yahweh.
\v 14 And cursed is a deceiver, who had in his drove a male, And is vowing, and is sacrificing a marred thing to the Lord, For a great king am I, said Yahweh of Hosts, And My name is revered among nations!
\c 2
\v 1 And now, to you is this charge, O priests,
\v 2 If you hearken not, and if you lay it not to heart, To give honour to My name, said Yahweh of Hosts, I have sent against you the curse, And I have cursed your blessings, Yea, I have also cursed it, Because you are not laying it to heart.
\v 3 Lo, I am pushing away before you the seed, And have scattered dung before your faces, Dung of your festivals, And it had taken you away with it.
\v 4 And you have known that I have sent unto you this charge, For My covenant being with Levi, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 5 My covenant had been with him of life and of peace, And I make them to him a fear, and he did fear Me, And because of My name he had been frightened.
\v 6 The law of truth had been in his mouth, And perverseness had not been found in his lips, In peace and in uprightness he walked with Me, And many he brought back from iniquity.
\v 7 For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, And law they do seek from his mouth, For a messenger of Yahweh of Hosts he is.
\v 8 And you, you have turned from the way, Ye have caused many to stumble in the law, Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 9 And I also, I have made you despised and low before all the people, Because you are not keeping My ways, And are accepting persons in the law.
\v 10 Have we not all one father? Hath not our God prepared us? Wherefore do we deal treacherously, Each against his brother, To pollute the covenant of our fathers?
\v 11 Dealt treacherously had Judah, And abomination had been done in Israel, and in Jerusalem, For polluted had Judah the holy thing of Yahweh, That He had loved, and had married the daughter of a strange god.
\v 12 Cut off did Yahweh the man who did it, Tempter and tempted — from the tents of Jacob, Even he who is bringing nigh a present to Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 13 And this a second time you do, Covering with tears the altar of Yahweh, With weeping and groaning, Because there is no more turning unto the present, Or receiving of a pleasing thing from your hand.
\v 14 And you have said, 'Wherefore?' Because Yahweh had testified between you And the wife of your youth, That you hast dealt treacherously against her, And she your companion, and your covenant-wife.
\v 15 And He did not make one only, And He had the remnant of the Spirit. And what is the one alone! He is seeking a godly seed. And you have been watchful over your spirit, And with the wife of your youth, None did deal treacherously.
\v 16 For I hate sending away, said Yahweh, God of Israel, And He who had covered violence with his clothing, said Yahweh of Hosts, And you have been watchful over your spirit, And you do not deal treacherously.
\v 17 Ye have wearied Yahweh with your words, And you have said: 'In what have we wearied Him?' In your saying: 'Every evil-doer is good in the eyes of Yahweh, And in them He is delighting,' Or, 'Where is the God of judgment?'
\c 3
\v 1 Lo, I am sending My messenger, And he had prepared a way before Me, And suddenly come in unto his temple Doth the Lord whom you are seeking, Even the messenger of the covenant, Whom you are desiring, Lo, he is coming, said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 2 And who is bearing the day of his coming? And who is standing in his appearing? For he is as fire of a refiner, And as soap of a fuller.
\v 3 And he had sat, a refiner and purifier of silver, And he had purified the sons of Levi, And had refined them as gold and as silver, And they have been to Yahweh bringing nigh a present in righteousness.
\v 4 And sweet to Yahweh had been the present of Judah and Jerusalem, As in days of old, and as in former years.
\v 5 And I have drawn near to you for judgment, And I have been a witness, Making haste against sorcerers, And against adulterers, And against swearers to a falsehood, And against oppressors of the hire of an hireling, Of a widow, and of a fatherless one, And those turning aside a sojourner, And who fear Me not, said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 6 For I am Yahweh, I have not changed, And you, the sons of Jacob, Ye have not been consumed.
\v 7 Even from the days of your fathers Ye have turned aside from My statutes, And you have not taken heed. Turn back unto Me, and I turn back to you, Said Yahweh of Hosts. And you have said, 'In what do we turn back?'
\v 8 Doth man deceive God? but you are deceiving Me, And you have said: 'In what have we deceived Thee?' The tithe and the heave-offering!
\v 9 With a curse you are cursed! And Me you are deceiving — this nation — all of it.
\v 10 Bring in all the tithe unto the treasure-house, And there is food in My house; When you have tried Me, now, with this, Said Yahweh of Hosts, Do not I open to you the windows of heaven? Yea, I have emptied on you a blessing till there is no space.
\v 11 And I have pushed for you against the consumer, And He did not destroy to you the fruit of the ground, Nor miscarry to you did the vine in the field, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 12 And declared you happy have all the nations, For you are a delightful land, said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 13 Hard against Me have been your words, Said Yahweh, and you have said: 'What have we spoken against Thee?'
\v 14 Ye have said, 'A vain thing to serve God! And what gain when we kept His charge? And when we have gone in black, Because of Yahweh of Hosts?
\v 15 And now, we are declaring the proud happy, Yea, built up have been those doing wickedness, Yea they have tempted God, and escape.'
\v 16 Then have those fearing Yahweh spoken one to another, And Yahweh did attend and hear, And written is a book of memorial before Him Of those fearing Yahweh, And of those esteeming His name.
\v 17 And they have been to Me, said Yahweh of Hosts, In the day that I am appointing — a peculiar treasure, And I have had pity on them, As one had pity on his son who is serving him.
\v 18 And you have turned back and considered, Between the righteous and the wicked, Between the servant of God and him who is not His servant.
\c 4
\v 1 For, behold, the day had come, burning as a furnace, And all the proud, and every wicked doer, have been stubble, And burnt them had the day that came, Said Yahweh of Hosts, That there is not left to them root or branch,
\v 2 And risen to you, you who fear My name, Hath the sun of righteousness — and healing in its wings, And you have gone forth, and have increased as calves of a stall.
\v 3 And you have trodden down the wicked, For they are ashes under the soles of your feet, In the day that I am appointing, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 4 Remember you the law of Moses My servant, That I did command him in Horeb, For all Israel — statutes and judgments.
\v 5 Lo, I am sending to you Elijah the prophet, Before the coming of the day of Yahweh, The great and the fearful.
\v 6 And he had turned back the heart of fathers to sons, And the heart of sons to their fathers, Before I come and have utterly smitten the land!
