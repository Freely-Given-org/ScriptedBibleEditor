\v 1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, had a word of Yahweh been unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:
\v 2 Yahweh was wroth against your fathers — wrath!
\v 3 And you hast said unto them, Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, turn back unto Me, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, And I turn back unto you, said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 4 Ye shall not be as your fathers, To whom the former prophets called, saying: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Turn back I pray you, From your evil ways and from your evil doings, And they did not hearken, Nor attend to Me — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 5 Your fathers — where are they? And the prophets — to the age do they live?
\v 6 Only, My words, and My statutes, That I commanded My servants the prophets, Have they not overtaken your fathers, And they turn back and say: As Yahweh of Hosts designed to do to us, According to our ways, and according to our doings, So He had done to us?'
\v 7 On the twenty and fourth day of the eleventh month, (it is the month of Sebat,) in the second year of Darius, had a word of Yahweh been unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:
\v 8 I have seen by night, and behold, one riding on a red horse, and he is standing between the myrtles that are in the shade, and behind him are horses, red, bay, and white.
\v 9 And I say, 'What are these, my lord?' And the messenger who is speaking with me said unto me, 'I — I do shew you what these are.'
\v 10 And the one who is standing between the myrtles did answer and say, 'These are they whom Yahweh had sent to walk up and down in the land.'
\v 11 And they answer the messenger of Yahweh who is standing between the myrtles, and say, 'We have walked up and down in the land, and behold, all the land is sitting still, and at rest.'
\v 12 And the messenger of Yahweh answereth and said, 'Yahweh of Hosts! till when will You not pity Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, that You hast abhorred these seventy years?'
\v 13 And Yahweh answereth the messenger, who is speaking with me, good words, comfortable words.
\v 14 And the messenger who is speaking with me, said unto me, 'Call, saying: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: I have been zealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion with great zeal.
\v 15 And with great wrath I am wroth against the nations who are at ease, For I was a little wroth, and they assisted — for evil.
\v 16 Therefore, thus said Yahweh: I have turned to Jerusalem with mercies, My house is built in it, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, And a line is stretched over Jerusalem.
\v 17 Again call, saying: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Again do my cities overflow from good, And Yahweh had again comforted Zion, And He had fixed again on Jerusalem.'
\v 18 And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and behold, four horns.
\v 19 And I say unto the messenger who is speaking with me, 'What are these?' And he said unto me, 'These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.'
\v 20 And Yahweh did shew me four artisans.
\v 21 And I say, 'What are these coming in to do?' And He spoke, saying: 'These are the horns that have scattered Judah, so that no one had lifted up his head, and these come in to trouble them, to cast down the horns of the nations who are lifting up a horn against the land of Judah — to scatter it.'
\c 2
\v 1 And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and behold, a man, and in his hand a measuring line.
\v 2 And I say, 'Whither are you going?' And he said unto me, 'To measure Jerusalem, to see how much is its breadth, and how much its length.'
\v 3 And behold, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out, and another messenger is going out to meet him,
\v 4 and he said unto him, 'Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Unwalled villages inhabit did Jerusalem, From the abundance of man and beast in her middle.
\v 5 And I — I am to her — an affirmation of Yahweh, A wall of fire round about, And for honour I am in her middle.
\v 6 Ho, ho, and flee from the land of the north, An affirmation of Yahweh, For, as the four winds of the heavens, I have spread you abroad, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 7 Ho, Zion, be delivered who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.
\v 8 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts: After honour He had sent me unto the nations who are spoiling you, For he who is coming against you, Is coming against the daughter of His eye.
\v 9 For behold, I am waving my hand against them, And they have been a spoil to their servants. And you have known that Yahweh of Hosts had sent me.
\v 10 Singe, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, For behold, I am coming, and have dwelt in your middle, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 11 And joined have been many nations unto Yahweh in that day, And they have been to Me for a people, And I have dwelt in your middle, And you hast known that Yahweh of Hosts had sent me unto you.
\v 12 And Yahweh had inherited Judah, His portion on the holy ground, And He had fixed again on Jerusalem.
\v 13 Hush, all flesh, because of Yahweh, For He had been roused up from His holy habitation!'
\c 3
\v 1 And he sheweth me Joshua the high priest standing before the messenger of Yahweh, and the Adversary standing at his right hand, to be an adversary to him.
\v 2 And Yahweh said unto the Adversary: 'Yahweh did push against you, O Adversary, Yea, push against you did Yahweh, Who is fixing on Jerusalem, Is not this a brand delivered from fire?'
\v 3 And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and is standing before the messenger.
\v 4 And he answereth and spoke unto those standing before him, saying: 'Turn aside the filthy garments from off him.' And he said unto him, 'See, I have caused yours iniquity to pass away from off you, so as to clothe you with costly apparel.'
\v 5 He also said, 'Let them set a pure diadem on his head. And they set the pure diadem on his head, and clothe him with garments. And the messenger of Yahweh is standing,
\v 6 and the messenger of Yahweh did protest to Joshua, saying:
\v 7 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: If in My ways you will walk, And if My charge you will keep, Then also you will judge My house, And also you will keep My courts, And I have given to you conductors among these standing by.
\v 8 Hear, I pray you, Joshua, the high priest, You and your companions sitting before you, (For men of type are they,) For behold, I am bringing in My servant — a Shoot.
\v 9 For behold, the stone that I put before Joshua, On one stone are seven eyes, Lo, I am graving its graving, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, And I have removed the iniquity of that land in one day.
\v 10 In that day — an affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, Ye do call, each unto his neighbour, Unto the place of the vine, And unto the place of the fig-tree!'
\c 4
\v 1 And the messenger who is speaking with me did turn back, and stir me up as one who is stirred up out of his sleep,
\v 2 and he said unto me, 'What are you seeing?' And I say, 'I have looked, and behold, a candlestick of gold — all of it, and its bowl is on its top, and its seven lamps are upon it, and twice seven pipes are to the lights that are on its top,
\v 3 and two olive-trees are by it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.'
\v 4 And I answer and speak unto the messenger who is speaking with me, saying, 'What are these, my lord?'
\v 5 And the messenger who is speaking with me answereth and said unto me, 'Hast you not known what these are?' And I say, 'No, my lord.'
\v 6 And he answereth and spoke unto me, saying: 'This is a word of Yahweh unto Zerubbabel, saying: Not by a force, nor by power, But — by My Spirit, said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 7 Who are you, O great mountain Before Zerubbabel — for a plain! And he had brought forth the top-stone, Cries of Grace, grace — are to it.'
\v 8 And there is a word of Yahweh to me, saying,
\v 9 Hands of Zerubbabel did found this house, And his hands do finish it, And you hast known that Yahweh of Hosts Hath sent me unto you.
\v 10 For who trampled on the day of small things, They have rejoiced, And seen the tin weight in the hand of Zerubbabel, These seven are the eyes of Yahweh, They are going to and fro in all the land.'
\v 11 And I answer and say unto him, 'What are these two olive-trees, on the right of the candlestick, and on its left?'
\v 12 And I answer a second time, and say unto him, 'What are the two branches of the olive trees that, by means of the two golden pipes, are emptying out of themselves the oil?'
\v 13 And he spoke unto me, saying, 'Hast you not known what these are?' And I say, 'No, my lord.'
\v 14 And he said, 'These are the two sons of the oil, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.'
\c 5
\v 1 And I turn back, and lift up mine eyes, and look, and behold, a flying roll.
\v 2 And he said unto me, 'What are you seeing?' And I say, 'I am seeing a flying roll, its length twenty by the cubit, and its breadth ten by the cubit.'
\v 3 And he said unto me, 'This is the execration that is going forth over the face of all the land, for every one who is stealing, on the one side, according to it, had been declared innocent, and every one who had sworn, on the other side, according to it, had been declared innocent.
\v 4 I have brought it out — an affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts — and it had come in unto the house of the thief, and unto the house of him who had sworn in My name to a falsehood, and it had remained in the middle of his house, and had consumed it, both its wood and its stones.'
\v 5 And the messenger who is speaking with me went forth, and said unto me, 'Lift up, I pray you, yours eyes, and see what is this that is coming forth?'
\v 6 And I say, 'What is it?' And he said, 'This — the ephah that is coming forth.' And he said, 'This is their aspect in all the land.
\v 7 And behold, a cake of lead lifted up; and this is a woman sitting in the middle of the ephah.'
\v 8 And he said, 'This is the wicked woman.' And he threw her unto the middle of the ephah, and threw the weight of lead on its mouth.
\v 9 And I lift up mine eyes, and see, and behold, two women are coming forth, and wind in their wings; and they have wings like wings of the stork, and they lift up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
\v 10 And I say unto the messenger who is speaking with me, 'Whither are they causing the ephah to go?'
\v 11 And he said unto me, 'To build to it a house in the land of Shinar.' And it had been prepared and had been placed there on its base.
\c 6
\v 1 And I turn back, and lift up mine eyes, and look, and behold, four chariots are coming forth from between two of the mountains, and the mountains are mountains of brass.
\v 2 In the first chariot are red horses, and in the second chariot brown horses,
\v 3 and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot strong grisled horses.
\v 4 And I answer and say unto the messenger who is speaking with me, 'What are these, my lord?'
\v 5 And the messenger answereth and said unto me, 'These are four spirits of the heavens coming forth from presenting themselves before the Lord of the whole earth.
\v 6 The brown horses that are therein, are coming forth unto the land of the north; and the white have come forth unto their hinder part; and the grisled have come forth unto the land of the south;
\v 7 and the strong ones have come forth, and they seek to go to walk up and down in the earth;' and he said, 'Go, walk up and down in the earth;' and they walk up and down in the earth.
\v 8 And he called me, and spoke unto me, saying, 'See, those coming forth unto the land of the north have caused My Spirit to rest in the land of the north.'
\v 9 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 10 to take of the captivity (who came from Babylon) from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, 'and you hast come in — you, in that day, yea, you hast come into the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah,
\v 11 and you hast taken silver and gold, and hast made a crown, and hast placed on the head of Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest,
\v 12 and hast spoken unto him, saying: Thus spake Yahweh of Hosts, saying: Lo, a man! A Shoot — is his name, And from his place he did shoot up, And he had built the temple of Yahweh.
\v 13 Yea, he did build the temple of Yahweh, And he did bear away honour, And he had sat and ruled on His throne, And had been a priest on His throne, And a counsel of peace is between both.
\v 14 And the crown is to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.
\v 15 And the far-off come in, and they have built in the temple of Yahweh, and you have known that Yahweh of Hosts had sent me unto you, yea, it had come to pass, if you do certainly hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God.'
\c 7
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the fourth year of Darius the king had a word of Yahweh been unto Zechariah, in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chisleu.
\v 2 And Beth-El sent Sherezer and Regem-Melech, and its men, to appease the face of Yahweh,
\v 3 speaking unto the priests who are at the house of Yahweh of Hosts, and unto the prophets, saying, 'Do I weep in the fifth month — being separated — as I have done these so many years?'
\v 4 And there is a word of Yahweh of Hosts unto me, saying:
\v 5 'Speak unto all the people of the land, and unto the priests, saying:
\v 6 When you fasted with mourning in the fifth and in the seventh months — even these seventy years — did you keep the fast to Me — Me? And when you eat, and when you drink, is it not you who are eating, and you who are drinking?
\v 7 Are not these the words that Yahweh proclaimed by the hand of the former prophets, in Jerusalem's being inhabited, and in safety, and its cities round about it, and the south and the plain — abiding?'
\v 8 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Zechariah, saying:
\v 9 'Thus spake Yahweh of Hosts, saying: True judgment judge you, And kindness and mercy do one with another.
\v 10 And widow, and fatherless, Sojourner, and poor, you do not oppress, And the calamity of one another you do not devise in your heart.
\v 11 And they refuse to attend, And they give a refractory shoulder, And their ears have made heavy against hearing.
\v 12 And their heart they have made adamant, Against hearing the law, and the words, That Yahweh of Hosts sent by His Spirit, By the hand of the former prophets, And their is great wrath from Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 13 And it came to pass, as He called, And they have not hearkened, So do they call, and I do not hearken, Said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 14 And I toss them on all the nations, That they have not known, The land had been desolate behind them, Of any passing by and turning back, And they set a desirable land for a desolation!
\c 8
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh of Hosts, saying:
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: I have been zealous for Zion with great zeal, With great heat I have been zealous for her.
\v 3 Thus said Yahweh: I have turned back unto Zion, And I have dwelt in the middle of Jerusalem, And Jerusalem had been called 'The city of truth,' And the mountain of Yahweh of Hosts, 'The holy mountain.'
\v 4 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Again dwell do old men and old women, In broad places of Jerusalem, And each his staff in his hand, Because of abundance of days.
\v 5 And broad places of the city are full of boys and girls, Playing in its broad places.
\v 6 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Surely it is wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, Also in Mine eyes it is wonderful, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 7 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Lo, I am saving My people from the land of the rising, And from the land of the going in, of the sun,
\v 8 And I have brought them in, They have dwelt in the middle of Jerusalem, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to them for God, In truth and in righteousness.
\v 9 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Let your hands be strong, Ye who are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets, That in the day the house of Yahweh of Hosts Hath been founded, the temple is to be built.
\v 10 For, before those days there had been no hiring of man, Yea, a hiring of beasts there is none; And to him who is going out, And to him who is coming in, There is no peace because of the adversary, And I send all men — each against his neighbour.
\v 11 And now, not as in the former days am I to the remnant of this people, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 12 Because of the sowing of peace, The vine did give her fruit, And the earth did give her increase, And the heavens do give their dew, And I have caused the remnant of this people To inherit all these.
\v 13 And it had come to pass, As you have been a reviling among nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel, So I save you, and you have been a blessing, Do not fear, let your hands be strong.
\v 14 For, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, As I did purpose to do evil to you, When your fathers made Me wroth, Said Yahweh of Hosts, and I did not repent,
\v 15 So I have turned back, I have purposed, in these days, To do good with Jerusalem, And with the house of Judah — fear not!
\v 16 These are the things that you do: Speak you truth each with his neighbour, Truth and peaceful judgment judge in your gates,
\v 17 And each the evil of his neighbour you do not devise in your heart, And a false oath you do not love, For all these are things that I have hated, An affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 18 And there is a word of Yahweh of Hosts unto me, saying:
\v 19 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth months, are to the house of Judah for joy and for rejoicing, and for pleasant appointed seasons, and the truth and the peace they have loved.
\v 20 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Yet come do peoples, and inhabitants of many cities,
\v 21 Yea, gone have inhabitants of one To another, saying: We go diligently, To appease the face of Yahweh, To seek Yahweh of Hosts — I go, even I.
\v 22 Yea, come in have many peoples, and mighty nations, To seek Yahweh of Hosts in Jerusalem, And to appease the face of Yahweh.
\v 23 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: In those days take hold do ten men of all languages of the nations, Yea, they have taken hold on the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying: We go with you, for we heard God is with you!
\c 9
\v 1 The burden of a word of Yahweh against the land of Hadrach, and Demmeseh — his place of rest: (When to Yahweh is the eye of man, And of all the tribes of Israel.)
\v 2 And also Hamath did border thereon, Tyre and Zidon, for — very wise!
\v 3 And Tyre did build a bulwark to herself, And did heap silver as dust, And gold as mire of out-places.
\v 4 Lo, the Lord did dispossess her, And He had smitten in the sea her force, And she with fire is consumed.
\v 5 See did Ashkelon and fear, Also Gaza, and she is exceedingly pained, Also Ekron — for her expectation dried up, And perished had a king from Gaza, And Ashkelon did not remain,
\v 6 And dwelt had a foreigner in Ashdod, And I have cut off the excellency of the Philistines.
\v 7 And turned aside his blood from his mouth, His abominations from between his teeth, And he had remained, even he, to our God, And he had been as a leader in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite.
\v 8 And I have pitched for My house a camp, Because of the passer through, and of the returner, And pass not through against them again did an exactor, For, now, I have seen with My eyes.
\v 9 Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem, Lo, your King did come to you, Righteous — and saved is He, Afflicted — and riding on an ass, And on a colt — a son of she-asses.
\v 10 And I have cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem, Yea, cut off had been the bow of battle, And he had spoken peace to nations, And his rule is from sea unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.
\v 11 Also you — by the blood of your covenant, I have sent your prisoners out of the pit, There is no water in it.
\v 12 Turn back to a fenced place, Ye prisoners of the hope, Even to-day a second announcer I restore to you.
\v 13 For I have trodden for Me Judah, A bow I have filled with Ephraim, And I have stirred up your sons, O Zion, Against your sons, O Javan, And I have set you as the sword of a hero.
\v 14 And Yahweh did appear for them, And gone forth as lightning had His arrow, And the Lord Yahweh with a trumpet bloweth, And He had gone with whirlwinds of the south.
\v 15 Yahweh of Hosts did cover them over, And they consumed, and subdued sling-stones, Yea, they have drunk, They have made a noise as wine, And they have been full as a bowl, As corners of an altar.
\v 16 And saved them had Yahweh their God In that day, as a flock of His people, For stones of a crown are displaying themselves over His ground.
\v 17 For what His goodness! and what His beauty! Corn the young men, And new wine the virgins — make fruitful!
\c 10
\v 1 They asked of Yahweh rain in a time of latter rain, Yahweh is making lightnings, And rain in showers He did give to them. To each — the herb in the field.
\v 2 Because the teraphim did speak iniquity, And the diviners have seen a falsehood, And dreams of the vanity they speak, With vanity they give comfort, Therefore they have journeyed as a flock, They are afflicted, for there is no shepherd.
\v 3 Against the shepherds did Mine anger burn, And against the he-goats I lay a charge, For inspected had Yahweh of Hosts His flock, the house of Judah, And set them as His beauteous horse in battle.
\v 4 From him is a corner-stone, From him a nail, from him a battle-bow, From him went forth every exactor together.
\v 5 And they have been as heroes, Treading in mire of out-places in battle, And they have fought, for Yahweh is with them, And have put to shame riders of horses.
\v 6 And I have made mighty the house of Judah, And the house of Joseph I do save, And I have caused them to dwell, for I have loved them, And they have been as if I had not cast them off, For I am Yahweh their God, And I answer them.
\v 7 And Ephraim had been as a hero, And rejoiced had their heart as wine, And their sons see, and they have rejoiced, Rejoice did their heart in Yahweh.
\v 8 I hist for them, and I gather them, For I have redeemed them, And they have multiplied as they did multiply.
\v 9 And I sow them among peoples, And in far-off places they remember Me, And they have lived with their sons, And they have turned back.
\v 10 And I have brought them back from the land of Egypt, And from Asshur I do gather them, And unto the land of Gilead and Lebanon I do bring them in, And there is not found for them space.
\v 11 And He had passed over through the sea, And had pressed and smitten billows in the sea, And dried up have been all depths of a flood, And brought down had been the excellency of Asshur, And the rod of Egypt did turn aside.
\v 12 And I have made them mighty in Yahweh, And in His name they walk up and down, An affirmation of Yahweh!
\c 11
\v 1 Open, O Lebanon, your doors, And fire did devour among your cedars.
\v 2 Howl, O fir, for fallen had the cedar, For their honourable ones were destroyed, Howl, you oaks of Bashan, For come down had the fenced forest,
\v 3 A voice of the howling of the shepherds! For destroyed was their robe of honour, A voice of the roaring of young lions! For destroyed was the excellency of Jordan.
\v 4 Thus said Yahweh my God: 'Feed the flock of the slaughter,
\v 5 Whose buyers slay them, and are not guilty, And their sellers say, Blessed is Yahweh, And I am rich, And their shepherds have no pity on them.
\v 6 For I have pity no more on inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Yahweh, And behold, I am causing man to come forth, Each into the hand of his neighbour, And into the hand of his king, And they have beaten down the land, And I do not deliver out of their hand.'
\v 7 And I feed the flock of slaughter, even you, you afflicted of the flock; and I take to me two staves, the one I have called Pleasantness, and the other I have called Bands, and I feed the flock.
\v 8 And I cut off the three shepherds in one month, and my soul is grieved with them, and also their soul had abhorred me.
\v 9 And I say, 'I do not feed you, the dying, let die; and the cut off, let be cut off; and the remaining ones, let each eat the flesh of its neighbour.'
\v 10 And I take My staff Pleasantness, and cut it asunder, to make void My covenant that I had made with all the peoples:
\v 11 and it is broken in that day, and know well do the afflicted of the flock who are observing me, that it is a word of Yahweh.
\v 12 And I say unto them: 'If good in your eyes, give my hire, and if not, forbear;' and they weigh out my hire — thirty silverlings.
\v 13 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Cast it unto the potter;' the goodly price that I have been prized at by them, and I take the thirty silverlings, and cast them to the house of Yahweh, unto the potter.
\v 14 And I cut asunder my second staff, Bands, to break the unity between Judah and Israel.
\v 15 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Again take to you the instrument of a foolish shepherd.
\v 16 For behold, I am raising up a shepherd in the land, The cut off he did not inspect, The shaken off he did not seek, And the broken he did not heal, The standing he did not sustain, And the flesh of the fat he did eat, And their hoofs he did break off.
\v 17 Woe to the worthless shepherd, forsaking the flock, A sword is on his arm, and on his right eye, His arm is utterly dried up, And his right eye is very dim!'
\c 12
\v 1 The burden of a word of Yahweh on Israel. An affirmation of Yahweh, Stretching out heaven, and founding earth, And forming the spirit of man in his middle.
\v 2 Lo, I am making Jerusalem a cup of reeling To all the peoples round about, And also against Judah it is, In the siege against Jerusalem.
\v 3 And it had come to pass, in that day, I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all the peoples, All loading it are completely pressed down, And gathered against it have been all nations of the earth.
\v 4 In that day — an affirmation of Yahweh, I do smite every horse with astonishment, And its rider with madness, And on the house of Judah I open My eyes, And every horse of the peoples I smite with blindness.
\v 5 And leaders of Judah have said in their heart, 'Strength to me are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, In Yahweh of Hosts their God.'
\v 6 In that day I make the leaders of Judah As a hearth of fire among trees, And as a torch of fire in a sheaf, And they have consumed — on the right and on the left — all the peoples round about, And Jerusalem had inhabited again her place in Jerusalem.
\v 7 And saved had Yahweh the tents of Judah first, So that become not great against Judah Doth the beauty of the house of David, And the beauty of the inhabitant of Jerusalem.
\v 8 In that day cover over did Yahweh the inhabitant of Jerusalem, And the stumbling among them had been in that day as David, And the house of David as God — As a messenger of Yahweh — before them.
\v 9 And it had come to pass, in that day, I seek to destroy all the nations Who are coming in against Jerusalem,
\v 10 And I have poured on the house of David, And on the inhabitant of Jerusalem, A spirit of grace and supplications, And they have looked unto Me whom they pierced, And they have mourned over it, Like a mourning over the only one, And they have been in bitterness for it, Like a bitterness over the first-born.
\v 11 In that day, great is the mourning of Jerusalem, As the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon,
\v 12 And mourned had the land — every family apart, The family of the house of David apart, And their women apart; The family of the house of Nathan apart, And their women apart;
\v 13 The family of the house of Levi apart, And their women apart; The family of Shimei apart, And their women apart,
\v 14 All the families that are left, Every family apart, and their women apart!
\c 13
\v 1 In that day there is a fountain opened To the house of David And to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For sin and for impurity.
\v 2 And it had come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, I cut off the names of the idols from the land, And they are not remembered any more, And also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I cause to pass away from the land.
\v 3 And it had been, when one prophesieth again, That said unto him have his father and his mother, his parents, 'You will not live, For falsehood you hast spoken in the name of Yahweh,' And pierced him through have his father and his mother, his parents, in his prophesying.
\v 4 And it had come to pass, in that day, Ashamed are the prophets, each of his vision, in his prophesying, And they put not on a hairy robe to deceive.
\v 5 And one had said, 'I am not a prophet, A man, a tiller of ground I am, For ground is my possession from my youth.'
\v 6 And one had said unto him, 'What are these wounds in your hands?' And he had said, 'Because I was smitten at home by my lovers.'
\v 7 Sword, awake against My shepherd, And against a hero — My fellow, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts. Smite the shepherd, and scattered is the flock, And I have put back My hand on the little ones.
\v 8 And it had come to pass, In all the land, an affirmation of Yahweh, Two parts in it are cut off — they expire, And the third is left in it.
\v 9 And I have brought the third into fire, And refined them like a refining of silver, And have tried them like a trying of gold, It did call in My name, and I answer it, I have said, 'My people it is,' And it said, 'Yahweh is my God!'
\c 14
\v 1 Lo, a day had come to Yahweh, And divided had been your spoil in your middle.
\v 2 And I have gathered all the nations unto Jerusalem to battle, And captured had been the city, And spoiled have been the houses, And the women are lain with, Gone forth had half the city in a removal, And the remnant of the people are not cut off from the city.
\v 3 And gone forth had Yahweh, And He had fought against those nations, As in the day of His fighting in a day of conflict.
\v 4 And stood have His feet, in that day, On the mount of Olives, That is before Jerusalem eastward, And cleft had been the mount of Olives at its middle, To the east, and to the west, a very great valley, And removed had the half of the mount towards the north. And its half towards the south.
\v 5 And you have fled to the valley of My mountains, For join did the valley of the mountains to Azal, And you have fled as you fled before the shaking, In the days of Uzziah king of Judah, And come in had Yahweh my God, All holy ones are with Thee.
\v 6 And it had come to pass, in that day, The precious light is not, it is dense darkness,
\v 7 And there had been one day, It is known to Yahweh, not day nor night, And it had been at evening-time — there is light.
\v 8 And it had come to pass, in that day, Go forth do living waters from Jerusalem, Half of them unto the eastern sea, And half of them unto the western sea, In summer and in winter it is.
\v 9 And Yahweh had become king over all the land, In that day there is one Yahweh, and His name one.
\v 10 Changed is all the land as a plain, From Gebo to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, And she had been high, and had dwelt in her place, Even from the gate of Benjamin To the place of the first gate, unto the front gate, And from the tower of Hananeel, Unto the wine-vats of the king.
\v 11 And they have dwelt in her, And destruction is no more, And Jerusalem had dwelt confidently.
\v 12 And this is the plague with which Yahweh Doth plague all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem, He had consumed away its flesh, And it is standing on its feet, And its eyes are consumed in their holes, And its tongue is consumed in their mouth.
\v 13 And it had come to pass, in that day, A great destruction from Yahweh is among them, And they have seized each the hand of his neighbour, And gone up had his hand against the hand of his neighbour.
\v 14 And also Judah is fought with in Jerusalem, And gathered had been the force of all the nations round about, Gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
\v 15 And so is the plague of the horse, of the mule, Of the camel, and of the ass, And of all the cattle that are in these camps, As this plague.
\v 16 And it had come to pass, Every one who had been left of all the nations, Who are coming in against Jerusalem, They have also gone up from year to year, To bow themselves to the King, Yahweh of Hosts, And to celebrate the feast of the booths.
\v 17 And it had come to pass, That he who did not go up of the families of the land unto Jerusalem, To bow himself to the King, Yahweh of Hosts, Even on them there is no shower.
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, nor come in, Then not on them is the plague With which Yahweh did plague the nations That go not up to celebrate the feast of booths.
\v 19 This is the punishment of the sin of Egypt, And the punishment of the sin of all the nations, That go not up to celebrate the feast of booths.
\v 20 In that day there is on bells of the horse, 'Holy to Yahweh,' And the pots in the house of Yahweh Have been as bowls before the altar.
\v 21 And every pot in Jerusalem, and in Judah, Have been holy to Yahweh of Hosts, And all those sacrificing have come in, And have taken of them, and boiled in them, And there is no merchant any more in the house of Yahweh of Hosts in that day!
