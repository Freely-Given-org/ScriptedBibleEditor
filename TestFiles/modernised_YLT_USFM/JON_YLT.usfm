\c 1
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jonah son of Amittai, saying:
\v 2 'Rise, go unto Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim against it that their wickedness had come up before Me.'
\v 3 And Jonah riseth to flee to Tarshish from the face of Yahweh, and went down to Joppa, and finds a ship going to Tarshish, and he gave its fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the face of Yahweh.
\v 4 And Yahweh had cast a great wind on the sea, and there is a great tempest in the sea, and the ship had reckoned to be broken;
\v 5 and the mariners are afraid, and cry each unto his god, and cast the goods that are in the ship into the sea, to make it light of them; and Jonah had gone down unto the sides of the vessel, and he lieth down, and is fast asleep.
\v 6 And the chief of the company draweth near to him, and said to him, 'What — to you, O sleeper? rise, call unto your God, it may be God did bethink himself of us, and we do not perish.'
\v 7 And they say each unto his neighbour, 'Come, and we cast lots, and we know on whose account this evil is on us.' And they cast lots, and the lot falleth on Jonah.
\v 8 And they say unto him, 'Declare to us, we pray you, on what account this evil is on us? what is yours occupation, and whence comest you? what is your country, seeing you are not of this people?'
\v 9 And he said unto them, 'A Hebrew I am, and Yahweh, God of the heavens, I am reverencing, who made the sea and the dry land.'
\v 10 And the men fear a great fear, and say unto him, 'What is this you hast done!' for the men have known that from the face of Yahweh he is fleeing, for he had told them.
\v 11 And they say unto him, 'What do we do to you that the sea may cease from us, for the sea is more and more tempestuous?'
\v 12 And he said unto them, 'Lift me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea did cease from you; for I know that on my account this great tempest is upon you.'
\v 13 And the men row to turn back unto the dry land, and are not able, for the sea is more and more tempestuous against them.
\v 14 And they cry unto Yahweh, and say, 'We pray Thee, O Yahweh, let us not, we pray Thee, perish for this man's life, and do not lay on us innocent blood, for You, Yahweh, as You hast pleased, You hast done.'
\v 15 And they lift up Jonah, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceaseth from its raging;
\v 16 and the men fear Yahweh — a great fear, and sacrifice a sacrifice to Yahweh, and vow vows.
\v 17 And Yahweh appointeth a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah is in the bowels of the fish three days and three nights.
\c 2
\v 1 And Jonah prayeth unto Yahweh his God from the bowels of the fish.
\v 2 And he said: I called, because of my distress, to Yahweh, And He did answer me, From the belly of sheol I have cried, You hast heard my voice.
\v 3 When You will cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, Then the flood did compass me, All Your breakers and Your billows have passed over me.
\v 4 And I — I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes, (Yet I add to look unto Your holy temple!)
\v 5 Compassed me have waters unto the soul, The deep did compass me, The weed is bound to my head.
\v 6 To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, The earth, her bars are behind me to the age. And You bringest up from the pit my life, O Yahweh my God.
\v 7 In the feebleness within me of my soul Yahweh I have remembered, And come in unto Thee did my prayer, Unto Your holy temple.
\v 8 Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake.
\v 9 And I — with a voice of thanksgiving — I sacrifice to Thee, That which I have vowed I complete, Salvation is of Yahweh.
\v 10 And Yahweh said to the fish, and it vomiteth out Jonah on the dry land.
\c 3
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jonah a second time, saying,
\v 2 'Rise, go unto Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim unto it the proclamation that I am speaking unto you;'
\v 3 and Jonah riseth, and he went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Yahweh. And Nineveh had been a great city before God, a journey of three days.
\v 4 And Jonah beginneth to go in to the city a journey of one day, and proclaimeth, and said, 'Yet forty days — and Nineveh is overturned.'
\v 5 And the men of Nineveh believe in God, and proclaim a fast, and put on sackcloth, from their greatest even unto their least,
\v 6 seeing the word did come unto the king of Nineveh, and he riseth from his throne, and removeth his honourable robe from off him, and spreadeth out sackcloth, and sitteth on the ashes,
\v 7 and he crieth and said in Nineveh by a decree of the king and his great ones, saying, 'Man and beast, herd and flock — let them not taste anything, let them not feed, even water let them not drink;
\v 8 and cover themselves with sackcloth let man and beast, and let them call unto God mightily, and let them turn back each from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
\v 9 Who knoweth? He did turn back, and God had repented, and had turned back from the heat of His anger, and we do not perish.'
\v 10 And God saw their works, that they have turned back from their evil way, and God repenteth of the evil that He spake of doing to them, and he had not done it.
\c 4
\v 1 And it is grievous unto Jonah — a great evil — and he is displeased at it;
\v 2 and he prayeth unto Yahweh, and he said, 'I pray Thee, O Yahweh, is not this my word while I was in mine own land — therefore I was beforehand to flee to Tarshish — that I have known that You are a God, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in kindness, and repenting of evil?
\v 3 And now, O Yahweh, take, I pray Thee, my soul from me, for better is my death than my life.'
\v 4 And Yahweh said, 'Is doing good displeasing to you?'
\v 5 And Jonah went forth from the city, and sitteth on the east of the city, and made to himself there a booth, and sitteth under it in the shade, till that he saw what is in the city.
\v 6 And Yahweh God appointeth a gourd, and caused it to come up over Jonah, to be a shade over his head, to give deliverance to him from his affliction, and Jonah rejoiceth because of the gourd with great joy.
\v 7 And God appointeth a worm at the going up of the dawn on the morrow, and it smiteth the gourd, and it drieth up.
\v 8 And it came to pass, about the rising of the sun, that God appointeth a cutting east wind, and the sun smiteth on the head of Jonah, and he wrappeth himself up, and asketh his soul to die, and said, 'Better is my death than my life.'
\v 9 And God said unto Jonah: 'Is doing good displeasing to you, because of the gourd?' and he said, 'To do good is displeasing to me — unto death.'
\v 10 And Yahweh said, 'You hast had pity on the gourd, for which you did not labour, neither did you nourish it, which a son of a night was, and a son of a night perished,
\v 11 and I — have not I pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than twelve myriads of human beings, who have not known between their right hand and their left — and much cattle!'
