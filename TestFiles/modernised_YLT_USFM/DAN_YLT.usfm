\v 1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, come had Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and laid siege against it;
\v 2 and the Lord gave into his hand Jehoiakim king of Judah, and some of the vessels of the house of God, and he brought them in to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he had brought in to the treasure-house of his god.
\v 3 And the king said, to Ashpenaz master of his eunuchs, to bring in out of the sons of Israel, (even of the royal seed, and of the chiefs,)
\v 4 lads in whom there is no blemish, and of good appearance, and skilful in all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and teaching thought, and who have ability to stand in the palace of the king, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
\v 5 And the king did appoint for them a rate, day by day, of the king's portion of food, and of the wine of his drinking, so as to nourish them three years, that at the end thereof they may stand before the king.
\v 6 And there are among them out of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\v 7 and the chief of the eunuchs setteth names on them, and he setteth on Daniel, Belteshazzar; and on Hananiah, Shadrach; and on Mishael, Meshach; and on Azariah, Abed-Nego.
\v 8 And Daniel purposeth in his heart that he will not pollute himself with the king's portion of food, and with the wine of his drinking, and he seeketh of the chief of the eunuchs that he may not pollute himself.
\v 9 And God gave Daniel for kindness and for mercies before the chief of the eunuchs;
\v 10 and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, 'I am fearing my lord the king, who had appointed your food and your drink, for why did he see your faces sadder than those of the lads which are of your circle? then you have made my head indebted to the king,'
\v 11 And Daniel said unto the Meltzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\v 12 'Try, I pray you, your servants, ten days; and they give to us of the vegetables, and we eat, and water, and we drink;
\v 13 and our appearance is seen before you, and the appearance of the lads who are eating the king's portion of food, and as you seest — deal with your servants.'
\v 14 And he hearkeneth to them, to this word, and trieth them ten days:
\v 15 and at the end of ten days their appearance had appeared better and fatter in flesh then any of the lads who are eating the king's portion of food.
\v 16 And the Meltzar is taking away their portion of food, and the wine of their drink, and is giving to them vegetables.
\v 17 As to these four lads, God had given to them knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature, and wisdom; and Daniel had given instruction about every kind of vision and dreams.
\v 18 And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring them in, bring them in did the chief of the eunuchs before Nebuchadnezzar.
\v 19 And the king spoke with them, and there had none been found among them all like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and they stand before the king;
\v 20 and in any matter of wisdom and understanding that the king had sought of them, he finds them ten hands above all the scribes, the enchanters, who are in all his kingdom.
\v 21 And Daniel is unto the first year of Cyrus the king.
\c 2
\v 1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, dreamed had Nebuchadnezzar dreams, and his spirit did move itself, and his sleep had been against him;
\v 2 and the king said to call for scribes, and for enchanters, and for sorcerers, and for Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they come in and stand before the king;
\v 3 and the king said to them, 'A dream I have dreamed, and moved is my spirit to know the dream.'
\v 4 And the Chaldeans speak to the king in Aramaean, 'O king, to the ages live, tell the dream to your servants, and the interpretation we do shew.'
\v 5 The king had answered and said to the Chaldeans, 'The thing from me is gone; if you do not cause me to know the dream and its interpretation, pieces you are made, and your houses are made dunghills;
\v 6 and if the dream and its interpretation you do shew, gifts, and fee, and great glory you receive from before me, therefore the dream and its interpretation shew you me.'
\v 7 They have answered a second time, and are saying, 'Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and the interpretation we do shew.
\v 8 The king had answered and said, 'Of a truth I know that time you are gaining, because that you have seen that the thing is gone from me,
\v 9 so that, if the dream you do not cause me to know — one is your sentence, seeing a word lying and corrupt you have prepared to speak before me, till that the time is changed, therefore the dream tell you to me, then do I know that its interpretation you do shew me.'
\v 10 The Chaldeans have answered before the king, and are saying, 'There is not a man on the earth who is able to shew the king's matter; therefore, no king, chief, and ruler, had asked such a thing as this of any scribe, and enchanter, and Chaldean;
\v 11 and the thing that the king is asking is precious, and others are there not that do shew it before the king, save the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.'
\v 12 Therefore the king had been angry and very wroth, and had said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon;
\v 13 And the sentence had gone forth, and the wise men are being killed, and they have sought Daniel and his companions to be killed.
\v 14 Then Daniel had replied with counsel and discretion to Arioch chief of the executioners of the king, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
\v 15 He had answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, 'Wherefore is the sentence so urgent from before the king?' Then Arioch had made the thing known to Daniel,
\v 16 and Daniel had gone up, and sought of the king that he would give him time to shew the interpretation to the king.
\v 17 Then Daniel to his house had gone, and to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, he had made the thing known,
\v 18 and to seek mercies from before the God of the heavens concerning this secret, that they destroy not Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
\v 19 Then to Daniel, in a vision of the night, the secret had been revealed. Then had Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.
\v 20 Daniel had answered and said, 'Let the name of God be blessed from age even unto age, for wisdom and might — for they are His.
\v 21 And He is changing times and seasons, He is causing kings to pass away, and He is raising up kings; He is giving wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those possessing understanding.
\v 22 He is revealing deep and hidden things; He had known what is in darkness, and light with Him had dwelt.
\v 23 Thee, O God of my fathers, I am thanking and praising, for wisdom and might You hast given to me; and now, You hast caused me to know that which we have sought from Thee, for the king's matter You hast caused us to know.'
\v 24 Therefore Daniel had gone up unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he had gone, and thus had said to him, 'The wise men of Babylon you will not destroy, bring me up before the king, and the interpretation to the king I do shew.'
\v 25 Then Arioch in haste had brought up Daniel before the king, and thus had said to him — 'I have found a man of the sons of the Removed of Judah, who the interpretation to the king did make known.'
\v 26 The king had answered and said to Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, 'Art you able to cause me to know the dream that I have seen, and its interpretation?'
\v 27 Daniel had answered before the king and said, 'The secret that the king is asking, the wise men, the enchanters, the scribes, the soothsayers, are not able to shew to the king;
\v 28 but there is a God in the heavens, a revealer of secrets, and He had made known to king Nebuchadnezzar that which is to be in the latter end of the days. 'Your dream and the visions of your head on your bed are these:
\v 29 You, O king, your thoughts on your bed have come up concerning that which is to be after this, and the Revealer of secrets had caused you to know that which is to be.
\v 30 As to me — not for any wisdom that is in me above any living had this secret been revealed to me; but for the intent that the interpretation to the king they make known, and the thoughts of your heart you will know.
\v 31 You, O king, wast looking, and behold, a certain great image. This image is mighty, and its brightness excellent; it is standing over-against you, and its appearance is terrible.
\v 32 This image! its head is of good gold, its breasts and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass;
\v 33 its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron, and part of them of clay.
\v 34 You wast looking till that a stone had been cut out without hands, and it had smitten the image on its feet, that are of iron and of clay, and it had broken them small;
\v 35 then broken small together have been the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, and they have been as chaff from the summer threshing-floor, and carried them away had the wind, and no place had been found for them: and the stone that smote the image had become a great mountain, and had filled all the land.
\v 36 This is the dream, and its interpretation we do tell before the king.
\v 37 'You, O king, are a king of kings, for the God of the heavens a kingdom, strength, and might, and glory, had given to you;
\v 38 and wheresoever sons of men are dwelling, the beast of the field, and the fowl of the heavens, He had given into your hand, and had caused you to rule over them all; you are this head of gold.
\v 39 And after you did rise up another kingdom lower than those, and another third kingdom of brass, that did rule overall the earth.
\v 40 And the fourth kingdom is strong as iron, because that iron is breaking small, and making feeble, all things, even as iron that is breaking all these, it beateth small and breaketh.
\v 41 As to that which you hast seen: the feet and toes, part of them potter's clay, and part of them iron, the kingdom is divided: and some of the standing of the iron is to be in it, because that you hast seen the iron mixed with miry clay.
\v 42 As to the toes of the feet, part of them iron, and part of them clay: some part of the kingdom is strong, and some part of it is brittle.
\v 43 Because you hast seen iron mixed with miry clay, they are mixing themselves with the seed of men: and they are not adhering one with another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
\v 44 And in the days of these kings raise up did the God of the heavens a kingdom that is not destroyed — to the age, and its kingdom to another people is not left: it beateth small and endeth all these kingdoms, and it standeth to the age.
\v 45 Because that you hast seen that out of the mountain cut had been a stone without hands, and it had beaten small the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God had made known to the king that which is to be after this; and the dream is true, and its interpretation stedfast.
\v 46 Then had king Nebuchadnezzar fallen on his face, and to Daniel he had done obeisance, and present, and sweet things, he had said to pour out to him.
\v 47 The king had answered Daniel and said, 'Of a truth it is that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you hast been able to reveal this secret.'
\v 48 Then the king had made Daniel great, and many great gifts he had given to him, and had caused him to rule over all the province of Babylon, and chief of the perfects over all the wise men of Babylon.
\v 49 And Daniel had sought from the king, and he had appointed over the work of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, and Daniel is in the gate of the king.
\c 3
\v 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king had made an image of gold, its height sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits; he had raised it up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babylon;
\v 2 and Nebuchadnezzar the king had sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the honourable judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the province, to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.
\v 3 Then are gathered the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the honourable judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the province, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up: and they are standing before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had raised up.
\v 4 And a crier is calling mightily: 'To you they are saying: O peoples, nations, and languages!
\v 5 at the time that you hear the voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut, the psaltery, the symphony, and all kinds of music, you fall down and do obeisance to the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up:
\v 6 and whoso did not fall down and do obeisance, in that hour he is cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.'
\v 7 Therefore at that time, when all the peoples are hearing the voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut, the psaltery, and all kinds of music, falling down are all the peoples, nations and languages, doing obeisance to the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.
\v 8 Therefore at that time drawn near have certain Chaldeans, and accused the Jews;
\v 9 they have answered, yea, they are saying to Nebuchadnezzar the king, 'O king, to the ages live!
\v 10 You, O king, hast made a decree that every man who did hear the voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut, the psaltery, and the symphony, and all kinds of music, did fall down and do obeisance to the golden image;
\v 11 and whoso did not fall down and do obeisance, is cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.
\v 12 There are certain Jews whom you hast appointed over the work of the province of Babylon — Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, these men have not made of you, O king, any regard; your gods they are not serving, and to the golden image you hast raised up — are not making obeisance.'
\v 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar, in anger and fury, had said to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. Then these men have been brought in before the king.
\v 14 Nebuchadnezzar had answered and said to them, 'Is it a laid plan, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego — my gods you are not serving, and to the golden image that I have raised up you are not doing obeisance?
\v 15 Now, behold, you are ready, so that at the time that you hear the voice of the cornet, the flute, the harp, the sackbut, the psaltery, and the symphony, and all kinds of music, you fall down and do obeisance to the image that I have made! — and behold, you do no obeisance — in that hour you are cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace; who is that God who did deliver you out of my hands?'
\v 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego have answered, yea, they are saying to the king Nebuchadnezzar, 'We have no need concerning this matter to answer you.
\v 17 Lo, it is; our God whom we are serving, is able to deliver us from a burning fiery furnace; and from your hand, O king, He did deliver.
\v 18 And behold — not! be it known to you, O king, that your gods we are not serving, and to the golden image you hast raised up we do no obeisance.'
\v 19 Then Nebuchadnezzar had been full of fury, and the expression of his face had been changed concerning Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; he answered and said to heat the furnace seven times above that which it is seen to be heated;
\v 20 and to certain mighty men who are in his force he had said to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, to cast into the burning fiery furnace.
\v 21 Then these men have been bound in their coats, their tunics, and their turbans, and their clothing, and have been cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.
\v 22 Therefore, because that the word of the king is urgent, and the furnace heated exceedingly, those men who have taken up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego — killed them had the spark of the fire.
\v 23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, have fallen down in the middle of the burning fiery furnace — bound.
\v 24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king had been astonished, and had risen in haste; he had answered and said to his counsellors, 'Have we not cast three men into the middle of the fire — bound?' They have answered and are saying to the king, 'Certainly, O king.'
\v 25 He answered and had said, 'Lo, I am seeing four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like to a son of the gods.'
\v 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar had drawn near to the gate of the burning fiery furnace; he had answered and said, 'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of God Most High come forth, yea, come;' then come forth do Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, from the middle of the fire;
\v 27 and gathered together, the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the counsellors of the king, are seeing these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their head had not been singed, and their coats have not changed, and the smell of fire had not passed on them.
\v 28 Nebuchadnezzar had answered and had said, 'Blessed is the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who had sent His messenger, and had delivered His servants who trusted on Him, and the word of the king changed, and gave up their bodies that they might not serve nor do obeisance to any god except to their own God.
\v 29 And by me a decree is made, that any people, nation, and language, that did speak erroneously concerning the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, pieces he is made, and its house is made a dunghill, because that there is no other god who is able thus to deliver.'
\v 30 Then the king had caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, to prosper in the province of Babylon.
\c 4
\v 1 'Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations, and languages, who are dwelling in all the earth: Your peace be great!
\v 2 The signs and wonders that God Most High had done with me, it is good before me to shew.
\v 3 His signs how great! and His wonders how mighty! His kingdom is a kingdom age-during, and His rule is with generation and generation.
\v 4 'I, Nebuchadnezzar, have been at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:
\v 5 a dream I have seen, and it made me afraid, and the conceptions on my bed, and the visions of my head, do trouble me.
\v 6 And by me a decree is made, to cause all the wise men of Babylon to come up before me, that the interpretation of the dream they may cause me to know.
\v 7 Then coming up are the scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and the dream I have told before them, and its interpretation they are not making known to me.
\v 8 And at last come up before me had Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar — according to the name of my god — and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and the dream before him I have told:
\v 9 O Belteshazzar, master of the scribes, as I have known that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret did press you, the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation, tell.
\v 10 As to the visions of my head on my bed, I was looking, and behold, a tree in the middle of the earth, and its height is great:
\v 11 become great had the tree, yea, strong, and its height did reach to the heavens, and its vision to the end of the whole land;
\v 12 its leaves are fair, and its budding great, and food for all is in it: under it take shade did the beast of the field, and in its boughs dwell do the birds of the heavens, and of it fed are all flesh.
\v 13 'I was looking, in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a sifter, even a holy one, from the heavens is coming down.
\v 14 He is calling mightily, and thus had said, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its budding, move away let the beast from under it, and the birds from off its branches;
\v 15 but the stump of its roots leave in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and with the dew of the heavens is it wet, and with the beasts is his portion in the herb of the earth;
\v 16 his heart from man's is changed, and the heart of a beast is given to him, and seven times pass over him;
\v 17 by the decree of the sifters is the sentence, and by the saying of the holy ones the requirement, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and to whom He willeth He gave it, and the lowest of men He did raise up over it.
\v 18 This dream I have seen, I king Nebuchadnezzar; and you, O Belteshazzar, the interpretation tell, because that all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to cause me to know the interpretation, and you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
\v 19 Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, had been astonished about one hour, and his thoughts do trouble him; the king had answered and said, O Belteshazzar, let not the dream and its interpretation trouble you. Belteshazzar had answered and said, My lord, the dream — to those hating you, and its interpretation — to yours enemies!
\v 20 The tree that you hast seen, that had become great and strong, and its height did reach to the heavens, and its vision to all the land,
\v 21 and its leaves are fair, and its budding great, and food for all is in it, under it dwell did the beast of the field, and on its boughs sit do the birds of the heavens.
\v 22 You it is, O king, for you hast become great and mighty, and your greatness had become great, and had reached to the heavens, and your dominion to the end of the earth;
\v 23 and that which the king had seen — a sifter, even a holy one, coming down from the heavens, and he had said, Cut down the tree, and destroy it; but the stump of its roots leave in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and with the dew of the heavens it is wet, and with the beast of the field is his portion, till that seven times pass over him.
\v 24 This is the interpretation, O king, and the decree of the Most High it is that had come against my lord the king:
\v 25 and they are driving you away from men, and with the beast of the field is your dwelling, and the herb as oxen they do cause you to eat, and by the dew of the heavens they are wetting you, and seven times do pass over you, till that you knowest that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and to whom He willeth He gave it.
\v 26 And that which they said — to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; your kingdom for you abideth, after that you knowest that the heavens are ruling.
\v 27 'Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you, and your sins by righteousness break off, and your perversity by pitying the poor, behold, it is a lengthening of yours ease.
\v 28 All — had come on Nebuchadnezzar the king.
\v 29 'At the end of twelve months, on the palace of the kingdom of Babylon he had been walking;
\v 30 the king had answered and said, Is not this that great Babylon that I have built, for the house of the kingdom, in the might of my strength, and for the glory of mine honour?
\v 31 While the word is in the king's mouth a voice from the heavens had fallen: To you they are saying: O Nebuchadnezzar the king, the kingdom had passed from you,
\v 32 and from men they are driving you away, and with the beast of the field is your dwelling, the herb as oxen they do cause you to eat, and seven times do pass over you, till that you knowest that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and to whom He willeth He gave it.
\v 33 'In that hour the thing had been fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar, and from men he is driven, and the herb as oxen he eateth, and by the dew of the heavens his body is wet, till that his hair as eagles' had become great, and his nails as birds.'
\v 34 And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, mine eyes to the heavens have lifted up, and mine understanding unto me returneth, and the Most High I have blessed, and the Age-during Living One I have praised and honoured, whose dominion is a dominion age-during, and His kingdom with generation and generation;
\v 35 and all who are dwelling on the earth as nothing are reckoned, and according to his will He is doing among the forces of the heavens and those dwelling on the earth, and there is none that did clap with his hand, and said to Him, What hast You done?
\v 36 'At that time my understanding did return unto me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and my brightness did return unto me, and to me my counsellors and my great men do seek, and over my kingdom I have been made right, and abundant greatness had been added to me.
\v 37 Now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, am praising and exalting and honouring the King of the heavens, for all His works are truth, and His paths judgment, and those walking in pride He is able to humble.'
\c 5
\v 1 Belshazzar the king had made a great feast to a thousand of his great men, and before the thousand he is drinking wine;
\v 2 Belshazzar had said — while tasting the wine — to bring in the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple that is in Jerusalem, that drink with them may the king, and his great men, his wives, and his concubines.
\v 3 Then they have brought in the vessels of gold that had been taken out of the temple of the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and drunk with them have the king and his great men, his wives and his concubines;
\v 4 they have drunk wine, and have praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\v 5 In that hour come forth have fingers of a man's hand, and they are writing over-against the candlestick, on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king is seeing the extremity of the hand that is writing;
\v 6 then the king's countenance had changed, and his thoughts do trouble him, and the joints of his loins are loosed, and his knees are smiting one against another.
\v 7 Call did the king mightily, to bring up the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. Answered had the king, and said to the wise men of Babylon, that, 'Any man who did read this writing, and its interpretation did shew me, purple he putteth on, and a bracelet of gold is on his neck, and third in the kingdom he did rule.'
\v 8 Then coming up are all the wise men of the king, and they are not able to read the writing, and the interpretation to make known to the king;
\v 9 then the king Belshazzar is greatly troubled, and his countenance is changing in him, and his great men are perplexed.
\v 10 The queen, on account of the words of the king and his great men, to the banquet-house had come up. Answered had the queen, and said, 'O king, to the ages live; let not your thoughts trouble you, nor your countenance be changed:
\v 11 there is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and, in the days of your father, light, and understanding, and wisdom — as the wisdom of the gods — was found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar your father, chief of the scribes, enchanters, Chaldeans, soothsayers, established him — your father, O king — 
\v 12 because that an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of enigmas, and loosing of knots was found in him, in Daniel, whose name the king made Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and the interpretation he did show.'
\v 13 Then Daniel had been caused to come up before the king; answered had the king, and said to Daniel, 'You are that Daniel who are of the sons of the Removed of Judah, whom the king my father brought in out of Judah?
\v 14 And I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and light, and understanding, and excellent wisdom have been found in you.
\v 15 'And now, caused to come up before me have been the wise men, the enchanters, that this writing they may read, and its interpretation to cause me to know: and they are not able to shew the interpretation of the thing:
\v 16 and I — I have heard of you, that you are able to give interpretations, and to loose knots: now, behold — you are able to read the writing, and its interpretation to cause me to know — purple you will put on, and a bracelet of gold is on your neck, and third in the kingdom you will rule.'
\v 17 Then had Daniel answered and said before the king, 'Your gifts be to thyself, and your fee to another give; nevertheless, the writing I do read to the king, and the interpretation I cause him to know;
\v 18 you, O king, God Most High, a kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and honour, gave to Nebuchadnezzar your father:
\v 19 and because of the greatness that He gave to him, all peoples, nations, and languages were trembling and fearing before him: whom he willed he was slaying, and whom he willed he was keeping alive, and whom he willed he was raising up, and whom he willed he was making low;
\v 20 and when his heart was high, and his spirit was strong to act proudly, he had been caused to come down from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory they have caused to pass away from him,
\v 21 and from the sons of men he is driven, and his heart with the beasts had been like, and with the wild asses is his dwelling; the herb like oxen they cause him to eat, and by the dew of the heavens is his body wet, till that he had known that God Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and whom He willeth He raiseth up over it.
\v 22 'And you, his son, Belshazzar, hast not humbled your heart, though all this you hast known;
\v 23 and against the Lord of the heavens you hast lifted up thyself; and the vessels of His house they have brought in before you, and you, and your great men, your wives, and your concubines, are drinking wine with them, and gods of silver, and of gold, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, that are not seeing, nor hearing, nor knowing, you hast praised: and the God in whose hand is your breath, and all your ways, Him you hast not honoured.
\v 24 'Then from before Him sent is the extremity of the hand, and the writing is noted down;
\v 25 and this is the writing that is noted down: Numbered, Numbered, Weighed, and Divided.
\v 26 This is the interpretation of the thing: Numbered — God had numbered your kingdom, and had finished it.
\v 27 Weighed — You are weighed in the balances, and hast been found lacking.
\v 28 Divided — Divided is your kingdom, and it had been given to the Medes and Persians.'
\v 29 Then had Belshazzar said, and they have clothed Daniel with purple, and a bracelet of gold is on his neck, and they have proclaimed concerning him that he is the third ruler in the kingdom.
\v 30 In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans is killed,
\v 31 and Darius the Mede had received the kingdom, when a son of sixty and two years.
\c 6
\v 1 It had been good before Darius, and he had established over the kingdom satraps — a hundred and twenty — that they may be throughout the whole kingdom,
\v 2 and higher than they three presidents, of whom Daniel is first, that these satraps may give to them an account, and the king have no loss.
\v 3 Then this Daniel had been overseer over the presidents and satraps, because that an excellent spirit is in him, and the king had thought to establish him over the whole kingdom.
\v 4 Then the presidents and satraps have been seeking to find a cause of complaint against Daniel concerning the kingdom, and any cause of complaint and corruption they are not able to find, because that he is faithful, and any error and corruption have not been found in him.
\v 5 Then these men are saying, 'We do not find against this Daniel any cause of complaint, except we have found it against him in the law of his God.'
\v 6 Then these presidents and satraps have assembled near the king, and thus they are saying to him: 'O king Darius, to the ages live!
\v 7 Taken counsel have all the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the governors, to establish a royal statute, and to strengthen an interdict, that any who seeketh a petition from any god and man until thirty days, save of you, O king, is cast into a den of lions.
\v 8 Now, O king, you will establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it is not to be changed, as a law of Media and Persia, that did not pass away.'
\v 9 Therefore king Darius had signed the writing and interdict.
\v 10 And Daniel, when he had known that the writing is signed, had gone up to his house, and the window being opened for him, in his upper chamber, over-against Jerusalem, three times in a day he is kneeling on his knees, and praying, and confessing before his God, because that he was doing it before this.
\v 11 Then these men have assembled, and found Daniel praying and entreating grace before his God;
\v 12 then they have come near, yea, they are saying before the king concerning the king's interdict: 'Hast you not signed an interdict, that any man who seeketh from any god and man until thirty days, save of you, O king, is cast into a den of lions?' Answered had the king, and said, 'The thing is certain as a law of Media and Persia, that did not pass away.'
\v 13 Then they have answered, yea, they are saying before the king, that, 'Daniel, who is of the sons of the Removed of Judah, had not placed on you, O king, any regard, nor on the interdict that you hast signed, and three times in a day he is seeking his petition.'
\v 14 Then the king, when he had heard the matter, is greatly displeased at himself, and on Daniel he had set the heart to deliver him, and till the going up of the sun he was arranging to deliver him.
\v 15 Then these men have assembled near the king, and are saying to the king, 'know, O king, that the law of Media and Persia is: That any interdict and statute that the king did establish is not to be changed.'
\v 16 Then the king had said, and they have brought Daniel, and have cast him into a den of lions. The king had answered and said to Daniel, 'Your God, whom you are serving continually, Himself did deliver you.'
\v 17 And a stone had been brought and placed at the mouth of the den, and the king had sealed it with his signet, and with the signet of his great men, that the purpose be not changed concerning Daniel.
\v 18 Then had the king gone to his palace, and he had passed the night fasting, and dahavan have not been brought up before him, and his sleep had fled from off him.
\v 19 Then did the king rise in the early morning, at the light, and in haste to the den of lions he had gone;
\v 20 and at his coming near to the den, to Daniel, with a grieved voice, he crieth. The king had answered and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God, whom you are serving continually, is He able to deliver you from the lions?'
\v 21 Then Daniel had spoken with the king: 'O king, to the ages live:
\v 22 my God had sent His messenger, and had shut the lions' mouths, and they have not injured me: because that before Him purity had been found in me; and also before you, O king, injury I have not done.'
\v 23 Then was the king very glad for him, and he had commanded Daniel to be taken up out of the den, and Daniel had been taken up out of the den, and no injury had been found in him, because he had believed in his God.
\v 24 And the king had said, and they have brought those men who had accused Daniel, and to the den of lions they have cast them, they, their sons, and their wives; and they have not come to the lower part of the den till that the lions have power over them, and all their bones they have broken small.
\v 25 Then Darius the king had written to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who are dwelling in all the land: 'Your peace be great!
\v 26 From before me is made a decree, that in every dominion of my kingdom they are trembling and fearing before the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, and abiding to the ages, and His kingdom that which is not destroyed, and His dominion is unto the end.
\v 27 A deliverer, and rescuer, and doer of signs and wonders in the heavens and in earth is He who had delivered Daniel from the paw of the lions.'
\v 28 And this Daniel had prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
\c 7
\v 1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had seen a dream, and the visions of his head on his bed, then the dream he had written, the chief of the things he had said.
\v 2 Answered had Daniel and said, 'I was seeing in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens are coming forth to the great sea;
\v 3 and four great beasts are coming up from the sea, diverse one from another.
\v 4 The first is like a lion, and it had an eagle's wings. I was seeing till that its wings have been plucked, and it had been lifted up from the earth, and on feet as a man it had been caused to stand, and a heart of man is given to it.
\v 5 And behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear, and to the same authority it had been raised, and three ribs are in its mouth, between its teeth, and thus they are saying to it, Rise, consume much flesh.
\v 6 'After this I was seeing, and behold, another like a leopard, and it had four wings of a fowl on its back, and four heads had the beast, and dominion is given to it.
\v 7 After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and behold, a fourth beast, terrible and fearful, and exceedingly strong; and it had iron teeth very great, it had consumed, yea, it did break small, and the remnant with its feet it had trampled; and it is diverse from all the beasts that are before it; and it had ten horns.
\v 8 I was considering about the horns, and behold, another horn, a little one, had come up between them, and three of the first horns have been eradicated from before it, and behold, eyes as the eyes of man are in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.
\v 9 I was seeing till that thrones have been thrown down, and the Ancient of Days is seated, His garment as snow is white, and the hair of his head is as pure wool, His throne flames of fire, its wheels burning fire.
\v 10 A flood of fire is proceeding and coming forth from before Him, a thousand thousands do serve Him, and a myriad of myriads before Him do rise up, the Judge is seated, and the books have been opened.
\v 11 'I was seeing, then, because of the voice of the great words that the horn is speaking, I was seeing till that the beast is killed, and his body had been destroyed, and given to the burning fire;
\v 12 and the rest of the beasts have caused their dominion to pass away, and a prolongation in life is given to them, till a season and a time.
\v 13 I was seeing in the visions of the night, and behold, with the clouds of the heavens as a son of man was one coming, and unto the Ancient of Days he had come, and before Him they have brought him near.
\v 14 And to him is given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and languages do serve him, his dominion is a dominion age-during, that passeth not away, and his kingdom that which is not destroyed.
\v 15 Pierced had been my spirit — I, Daniel — in the middle of the sheath, and the visions of my head trouble me;
\v 16 I have drawn near unto one of those standing, and the certainty I seek from him of all this; and he had said to me, yea, the interpretation of the things he had caused me to know:
\v 17 These great beasts, that are four, are four kings, they rise up from the earth;
\v 18 and receive the kingdom do the saints of the Most High, and they strengthen the kingdom unto the age, even unto the age of the ages.
\v 19 'Then I wished for certainty concerning the fourth beast, that was diverse from them all, fearful exceedingly; its teeth of iron, and its nails of brass, it had devoured, it did break small, and the remnant with its feet it had trampled;
\v 20 and concerning the ten horns that are in its heads, and of the other that came up, and before which three have fallen, even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose appearance is great above its companions.
\v 21 'I was seeing, and this horn is making war with the saints, and had prevailed over them,
\v 22 till that the Ancient of Days had come, and judgment is given to the saints of the Most High, and the time had come, and the saints have strengthened the kingdom.
\v 23 'Thus he said: The fourth beast is the fourth kingdom in the earth, that is diverse from all kingdoms, and it consumeth all the earth, and treadeth it down, and breaketh it small.
\v 24 And the ten horns out of the kingdom are ten kings, they rise, and another did rise after them, and it is diverse from the former, and three kings it humbleth;
\v 25 and words as an adversary of the Most High it did speak, and the saints of the Most High it did wear out, and it hopeth to change seasons and law; and they are given into its hand, till a time, and times, and a division of a time.
\v 26 And the Judge is seated, and its dominion they cause to pass away, to cut off, and to destroy — unto the end;
\v 27 and the kingdom, and the dominion, even the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heavens, is given to the people — the saints of the Most High, His kingdom is a kingdom age-during, and all dominions do serve and obey Him.
\v 28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, greatly do my thoughts trouble me, and my countenance is changed on me, and the matter in my heart I have kept.
\c 8
\v 1 In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision had appeared unto me — I Daniel — after that which had appeared unto me at the beginning.
\v 2 And I see in a vision, and it came to pass, in my seeing, and I am in Shushan the palace that is in Elam the province, and I see in a vision, and I have been by the stream Ulai.
\v 3 And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and behold, a certain ram is standing before the stream, and it had two horns, and the two horns are high; and the one is higher than the other, and the high one is coming up last.
\v 4 I have seen the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no living creatures do stand before it, and there is none delivering out of its hand, and it had done according to its pleasure, and had exerted itself.
\v 5 And I have been considering, and behold, a young he-goat had come from the west, over the face of the whole earth, whom none is touching in the earth; as to the young he-goat, a conspicuous horn is between its eyes.
\v 6 And it came unto the ram possessing the two horns, that I had seen standing before the stream, and runneth unto it in the fury of its power.
\v 7 And I have seen it coming near the ram, and it became embittered at it, and smiteth the ram, and breaketh its two horns, and there had been no power in the ram to stand before it, and it threw it to the earth, and trampleth it down, and there had been no deliverer to the ram out of its power.
\v 8 'And the young he-goat had exerted itself very much, and when it is strong, broken had been the great horn; and come up did a vision of four in its place, at the four winds of the heavens.
\v 9 And from the one of them come forth had a little horn, and it exerteth itself greatly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land;
\v 10 yea, it exerteth unto the host of the heavens, and caused to fall to the earth of the host, and of the stars, and trampleth them down.
\v 11 And unto the prince of the host it exerteth itself, and by it taken away had been the continual sacrifice, and thrown down the base of his sanctuary.
\v 12 And the host is given up, with the continual sacrifice, through transgression, and it throweth down truth to the earth, and it had worked, and prospered.
\v 13 And I hear a certain holy one speaking, and a certain holy one said to the wonderful numberer who is speaking: Till when is the vision of the continual sacrifice, and of the transgression, an astonishment, to make both sanctuary and host a treading down?
\v 14 And he said unto me, Till evening — morning two thousand and three hundred, then is the holy place declared right.
\v 15 And it came to pass in my seeing — I, Daniel — the vision, that I require understanding, and behold, standing over-against me is as the appearance of a mighty one.
\v 16 And I hear a voice of man between the banks of Ulai, and he called and said: Gabriel, cause this one to understand the appearance.
\v 17 And he came in near my station, and at his coming in I have been afraid, and I fall on my face, and he said unto me: Understand, son of man, for at the time of the end is the vision.
\v 18 And in his speaking with me, I have been in a trance on my face, on the earth; and he came against me, and caused me to stand on my station,
\v 19 and said: Lo, I — I am causing you to know that which is in the latter end of the indignation; for, at the appointed time is the end.
\v 20 The ram that you hast seen possessing two horns, are the kings of Media and Persia.
\v 21 And the young he-goat, the hairy one, is the king of Javan; and the great horn that is between its eyes is the first king;
\v 22 and that being broken, stand up do four in its place, four kingdoms from the nation do stand up, and not in its power.
\v 23 'And in the latter end of their kingdom, about the perfecting of the transgressors, stand up did a king, fierce of face, and understanding hidden things;
\v 24 and his power had been mighty, and not by his own power; and wonderful things he destroyeth, and he had prospered, and wrought, and destroyed mighty ones, and the people of the Holy Ones.
\v 25 And by his understanding he had also caused deceit to prosper in his hand, and in his heart he exerteth himself, and by ease he destroyeth many; and against the prince of princes he standeth — and without hand he is broken.
\v 26 And the appearance of the evening and of the morning, that is told, is true; and you, hide you the vision, for it is after many days.'
\v 27 And I, Daniel, have been, yea, I became sick for days, and I rise, and do the king's work, and am astonished at the appearance, and there is none understanding.
\c 9
\v 1 In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who had been made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,
\v 2 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, have understood by books the number of the years, (in that a word of Yahweh had been unto Jeremiah the prophet,) concerning the fulfilling of the wastes of Jerusalem — seventy years;
\v 3 and I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.
\v 4 And I pray to Yahweh my God, and confess, and say: 'I beseech Thee, O Lord God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and the kindness to those loving Him, and to those keeping His commands;
\v 5 we have sinned, and done perversely, and done wickedly, and rebelled, to turn aside from Your commands, and from Your judgments:
\v 6 and we have not hearkened unto Your servants, the prophets, who have spoken in Your name unto our kings, our heads, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\v 7 To Thee, O Lord, is the righteousness, and to us the shame of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, in all the lands where You hast driven them, in their trespass that they have trespassed against Thee.
\v 8 O Lord, to us is the shame of face, to our kings, to our heads, and to our fathers, in that we have sinned against Thee.
\v 9 To the Lord our God are the mercies and the forgivenesses, for we have rebelled against Him,
\v 10 and have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh our God, to walk in His laws, that He had set before us by the hand of His servants the prophets;
\v 11 and all Israel have transgressed Your law, to turn aside so as not to hearken to Your voice; and poured on us is the execration, and the oath, that is written in the law of Moses, servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.
\v 12 'And He confirmeth His words that He had spoken against us, and against our judges who have judged us, to bring in upon us great evil, in that it had not been done under the whole heavens as it had been done in Jerusalem,
\v 13 as it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil had come upon us, and we have not appeased the face of Yahweh our God to turn back from our iniquities, and to act wisely in Your truth.
\v 14 And Yahweh did watch for the evil, and brought it upon us, for righteous is Yahweh our God concerning all His works that He had done, and we have not hearkened to His voice.
\v 15 And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought forth Your people from the land of Egypt by a strong hand, and will make for Thee a name as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\v 16 O Lord, according to all Your righteous acts, let turn back, I pray Thee, Thine anger and Your fury from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mount, for by our sins, and by the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are for a reproach to all our neighbours;
\v 17 and now, hearken, O our God, unto the prayer of Your servant, and unto his supplication, and cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\v 18 Incline, O my God, Thine ear, and hear, open Thine eyes and see our desolations, and the city on which Your name is called; for not for our righteous acts are we causing our supplications to fall before Thee, but for Your mercies that are many.
\v 19 O lord, hear, O Lord, forgive; O Lord, attend and do; do not delay, for Thine own sake, O my God, for Your name is called on Your city, and on Your people.'
\v 20 And while I am speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and causing my supplication to fall before Yahweh my God, for the holy mount of my God,
\v 21 yea, while I am speaking in prayer, then that one Gabriel, whom I had seen in vision at the commencement, being caused to fly swiftly, is coming unto me at the time of the evening present.
\v 22 And he gave understanding, and spoke with me, and said, 'O Daniel, now I have come forth to cause you to consider understanding wisely;
\v 23 at the commencement of your supplications had the word come forth, and I have come to declare it, for you are greatly desired, and understand you concerning the matter, and consider concerning the appearance.
\v 24 'Seventy weeks are determined for your people, and for your holy city, to shut up the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to cover iniquity, and to bring in righteousness age-during, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies.
\v 25 And you will know, and will consider wisely, from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem till Messiah the Leader is seven weeks, and sixty and two weeks: the broad place had been built again, and the rampart, even in the distress of the times.
\v 26 And after the sixty and two weeks, cut off is Messiah, and the city and the holy place are not his, the Leader who had come did destroy the people; and its end is with a flood, and till the end is war, determined are desolations.
\v 27 And he had strengthened a covenant with many — one week, and in the middle of the week he caused sacrifice and present to cease, and by the wing of abominations he is making desolate, even till the consummation, and that which is determined is poured on the desolate one.'
\c 10
\v 1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing is revealed to Daniel, whose name is called Belteshazzar, and the thing is true, and the warfare is great: and he had understood the thing, and had understanding about the appearance.
\v 2 'In those days, I, Daniel, have been mourning three weeks of days;
\v 3 desirable bread I have not eaten, and flesh and wine had not come in unto my mouth, and I have not anointed myself at all, till the completion of three weeks of days.
\v 4 And in the twenty and fourth day of the first month, I have been by the side of the great river, that is Hiddekel:
\v 5 and I lift up mine eyes, and look, and behold, a certain one clothed in linen, and his loins girt with pure gold of Uphaz,
\v 6 and his body as a beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet as the aspect of bright brass, and the voice of his words as the voice of a multitude.
\v 7 And I have seen — I, Daniel, by myself — the appearance: and the men who have been with me have not seen the appearance, but a great trembling had fallen on them, and they flee to be hidden;
\v 8 and I have been left by myself, and I see this great appearance, and there had been no power left in me, and my honour had been turned in me to corruption, yea, I have not retained power.
\v 9 And I hear the voice of his words, and when I hear the voice of his words, then I have been in a trance on my face, and my face is to the earth;
\v 10 and behold, a hand had come against me, and shaketh me on my knees and the palms of my hands.
\v 11 'And he said unto me: Daniel, man greatly desired, attend to the words that I am speaking unto you, and stand on your station, for now I have been sent unto you. 'And when he spoke with me this word, I have stood trembling.
\v 12 And he said unto me: Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you did give your heart to understand, and to humble thyself before your God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.
\v 13 'And the head of the kingdom of Persia is standing over-against me twenty and one days, and behold, Michael, first of the chief heads, had come in to help me, and I have remained there near the kings of Persia;
\v 14 and I have come to cause you to understand that which did happen to your people in the latter end of the days, for yet the vision is after days.
\v 15 'And when he spoke with me about these things, I have set my face toward the earth, and have been silent;
\v 16 and behold, as the manner of the sons of men, he is striking against my lips, and I open my mouth, and I speak, and say unto him who is standing over-against me: My lord, by the appearance turned have been my pangs against me, and I have retained no power.
\v 17 And how is the servant of this my lord able to speak with this my lord? as for me, henceforth there remaineth in me no power, yea, breath had not been left in me.
\v 18 'And he addeth, and striketh against me, as the appearance of a man, and strengtheneth me,
\v 19 and he said: Do not fear, O man greatly desired, peace to you, be strong, yea, be strong; and when he spoke with me, I have strengthened myself, and I say, Let my lord speak, for you hast strengthened me.
\v 20 And he said, Hast you known why I have come unto you? and now I turn back to fight with the head of Persia; yea, I am going forth, and behold, the head of Javan had come;
\v 21 but I declare to you that which is noted down in the Writing of Truth, and there is not one strengthening himself with me, concerning these, except Michael your head.
\c 11
\v 1 And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, my standing is for a strengthener, and for a stronghold to him;
\v 2 and, now, truth I declare to you, Lo, yet three kings are standing for Persia, and the fourth did become far richer than all, and according to his strength by his riches he stirreth up the whole, with the kingdom of Javan.
\v 3 And a mighty king had stood, and he had ruled a great dominion, and had done according to his will;
\v 4 and according to his standing is his kingdom broken, and divided to the four winds of the heavens, and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion that he ruled, for his kingdom is plucked up — and for others apart from these.
\v 5 And a king of the south — even of his princes — did become strong, and did prevail against him, and had ruled; a great dominion is his dominion.
\v 6 And at the end of years they do join themselves together, and a daughter of the king of the south did come in unto the king of the north to do upright things; and she did not retain the power of the arm; and he did not stand, nor his arm; and she is given up, she, and those bringing her in, and her child, and he who is strengthening her in these times.
\v 7 And one had stood up from a branch of her roots, in his station, and he came in unto the bulwark, yea, he came into a stronghold of the king of the south, and had wrought against them, and had done mightily;
\v 8 and also their gods, with their princes, with their desirable vessels of silver and gold, into captivity he brought into Egypt; and he did stand more years than the king of the north.
\v 9 'And the king of the south had come into the kingdom, and turned back unto his own land;
\v 10 and his sons stir themselves up, and have gathered a multitude of great forces, and he had certainly come in, and overflowed, and passed through, and he turneth back, and they stir themselves up unto his stronghold.
\v 11 And the king of the south did become embittered, and had gone forth and fought with him, with the king of the north, and had caused a great multitude to stand, and the multitude had been given into his hand,
\v 12 and he had carried away the multitude, his heart is high, and he had caused myriads to fall, and he did not become strong.
\v 13 'And the king of the north had turned back, and had caused a multitude to stand, greater than the first, and at the end of the times a second time he did certainly come in with a great force, and with much substance;
\v 14 and in those times many do stand up against the king of the south, and sons of the destroyers of your people do lift themselves up to establish the vision — and they have stumbled.
\v 15 'And the king of the north came in, and poureth out a mount, and had captured fenced cities; and the arms of the south do not stand, nor the people of his choice, yea, there is no power to stand.
\v 16 And he who is coming unto him did according to his will, and there is none standing before him; and he standeth in the desirable land, and it is wholly in his hand.
\v 17 And he setteth his face to go in with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; and he had wrought, and the daughter of women he gave to him, to corrupt her; and she did not stand, nor is for him.
\v 18 And he turneth back his face to the isles, and had captured many; and a prince had caused his reproach of himself to cease; without his reproach he turneth it back to him.
\v 19 And he turneth back his face to the strongholds of his land, and had stumbled and fallen, and is not found.
\v 20 And stood up on his station had one causing an exactor to pass over the honour of the kingdom, and in a few days he is destroyed, and not in anger, nor in battle.
\v 21 'And stood up on his station had a despicable one, and they have not given unto him the honour of the kingdom, and he had come in quietly, and had strengthened the kingdom by flatteries.
\v 22 And the arms of the flood are overflowed from before him, and are broken; and also the leader of the covenant.
\v 23 And after they join themselves unto him, he worketh deceit, and had increased, and had been strong by a few of the nation.
\v 24 Peaceably even into the fertile places of the province He came, and he had done that which his fathers did not, nor his fathers' fathers; prey, and spoil, and substance, to them he scattereth, and against fenced places he deviseth his devices, even for a time.
\v 25 'And he stirreth up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great force, and the king of the south stirreth himself up to battle with a very great and mighty force, and standeth not, for they devise devices against him,
\v 26 and those eating his portion of food destroy him, and his force overfloweth, and fallen have many wounded.
\v 27 And both of the kings' hearts are to do evil, and at one table they speak lies, and it did not prosper, for yet the end is at a time appointed.
\v 28 And he turneth back to his land with great substance, and his heart is against the holy covenant, and he had wrought, and turned back to his land.
\v 29 At the appointed time he turneth back, and had come against the south, and it is not as the former, and as the latter.
\v 30 And ships of Chittim have come in against him, and he had been pained, and had turned back, and had been insolent toward the holy covenant, and had wrought, and turned back, and he understandeth concerning those forsaking the holy covenant.
\v 31 And strong ones out of him stand up, and have polluted the sanctuary, the stronghold, and have turned aside the continual sacrifice, and appointed the desolating abomination.
\v 32 And those acting wickedly against the covenant, he defileth by flatteries; and the people knowing their God are strong, and have wrought.
\v 33 And the teachers of the people give understanding to many; and they have stumbled by sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil — days.
\v 34 And in their stumbling, they are helped — a little help, and joined to them have been many with flatteries.
\v 35 And some of the teachers do stumble for refining by them, and for purifying, and for making white — till the end of the time, for it is yet for a time appointed.
\v 36 'And the king had done according to his will, and exalteth himself, and magnifieth himself against every god, and against the God of gods he spoke wonderful things, and had prospered till the indignation had been completed, for that which is determined had been done.
\v 37 And unto the God of his fathers he did not attend, nor to the desire of women, yea, to any god he did not attend, for against all he magnifieth himself.
\v 38 And to the god of strongholds, on his station, he gave honour; yea, to a god whom his fathers knew not he gave honour, with gold, and with silver, and with precious stone, and with desirable things.
\v 39 And he had dealt in the fortresses of the strongholds with a strange god whom he had acknowledged; he multiplieth honour, and had caused them to rule over many, and the ground he apportioneth at a price.
\v 40 'And at the time of the end, push himself forward with him did a king of the south, and storm against him did a king of the north, with chariot, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he had come in to the lands, and had overflowed, and passed over,
\v 41 and had come into the desirable land, and many do stumble, and these escape from his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.
\v 42 'And he sent forth his hand upon the lands, and the land of Egypt is not for an escape;
\v 43 and he had ruled over treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and Lubim and Cushim are at his steps.
\v 44 'And reports trouble him out of the east and out of the north, and he had gone forth in great fury to destroy, and to devote many to destruction;
\v 45 and he planted the tents of his palace between the seas and the holy desirable mountain, and had come unto his end, and there is no helper to him.

\v 1 'And at that time stand up did Michael, the great head, who is standing up for the sons of your people, and there had been a time of distress, such as had not been since there had been a nation till that time, and at that time do your people escape, every one who is found written in the book.
\v 2 And the multitude of those sleeping in the dust of the ground do awake, some to life age-during, and some to reproaches — to abhorrence age-during.
\v 3 And those teaching do shine as the brightness of the expanse, and those justifying the multitude as stars to the age and for ever.
\v 4 And you, O Daniel, hide the things, and seal the book till the time of the end, many do go to and fro, and knowledge is multiplied.'
\v 5 And I have looked — I, Daniel — and behold, two others are standing, one here at the edge of the flood, and one there at the edge of the flood,
\v 6 and he said to the one clothed in linen, who is upon the waters of the flood, 'Till when is the end of these wonders?'
\v 7 And I hear the one clothed in linen, who is upon the waters of the flood, and he did lift up his right hand and his left unto the heavens, and sweareth by Him who is living to the age, that, 'After a time, times, and a half, and at the completion of the scattering of the power of the holy people, finished are all these.'
\v 8 And I have heard, and I do not understand, and I say, 'O my lord, what is the latter end of these?'
\v 9 And he said, 'Go, Daniel; for hidden and sealed are the things till the time of the end;
\v 10 Purify themselves, yea, make themselves white, yea, refined are many: and the wicked have done wickedly, and none of the wicked understand, and those acting wisely do understand;
\v 11 and from the time of the turning aside of the perpetual sacrifice, and to the giving out of the desolating abomination, are days a thousand, two hundred, and ninety.
\v 12 O the blessedness of him who is waiting earnestly, and did come to the days, a thousand, three hundred, thirty and five.
\v 13 And you, go on to the end, then you will rest, and will stand in your lot at the end of the days.'
