\v 1 The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!
\v 2 beloved, concerning all things I desire you to prosper, and to be in health, even as your soul did prosper,
\v 3 for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in you, even as you in truth will walk;
\v 4 greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.
\v 5 Beloved, faithfully will you do whatever you may work to the brethren and to the strangers,
\v 6 who did testify of your love before an assembly, whom you wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,
\v 7 because for His name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;
\v 8 we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.
\v 9 I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them — Diotrephes — did not receive us;
\v 10 because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he did, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither did he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he did forbid, and out of the assembly he did cast.
\v 11 Beloved, be not you following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil had not seen God;
\v 12 to Demetrius testimony had been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also — we do testify, and you have known that our testimony is true.
\v 13 Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to you,
\v 14 and I hope straightway to see you, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to you! salute you do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.
