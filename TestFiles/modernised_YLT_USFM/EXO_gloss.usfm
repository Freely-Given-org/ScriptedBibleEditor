\c 1
\v 1 And these are the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his household have they come;
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\v 4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\v 5 And all the persons coming out of the thigh of Jacob are seventy persons; as to Joseph, he was in Egypt.
\v 6 And Joseph dieth, and all his brethren, and all that generation;
\v 7 and the sons of Israel have been fruitful, and they teem, and multiply, and are very very mighty, and the land is filled with them.
\v 8 And there riseth a new king over Egypt, who had not known Joseph,
\v 9 and he said unto his people, 'Lo, the people of the sons of Israel is more numerous and mighty than we;
\v 10 give help! let us act wisely concerning it, lest it multiply, and it had come to pass, when war happeneth, that it had been joined, even it, unto those hating us, and had fought against us, and had gone out up of the land.'
\v 11 And they set over it princes of tribute, so as to afflict it with their burdens, and it built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses;
\v 12 and as they afflict it, so it multiplieth, and so it breaketh forth, and they are vexed because of the sons of Israel;
\v 13 and the Egyptians cause the sons of Israel to serve with rigour,
\v 14 and make their lives bitter in hard service, in clay, and in brick, and in every kind of service in the field; all their service in which they have served is with rigour.
\v 15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives, the Hebrewesses, (of whom the name of the one is Shiphrah, and the name of the second Puah),
\v 16 and said, 'When ye cause the Hebrew women to bear, and have looked on the children; if it is a son — then ye have put him to death; and if it is a daughter — then she had lived.'
\v 17 And the midwives fear God, and have not done as the king of Egypt had spoken unto them, and keep the lads alive;
\v 18 and the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, 'Wherefore have ye done this thing, and keep the lads alive?'
\v 19 And the midwives say unto Pharaoh, 'Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women, for they are lively; before the midwife came in unto them — they have borne!'
\v 20 And God did good to the midwives, and the people multiply, and are very mighty;
\v 21 and it came to pass, because the midwives have feared God, that He made for them households;
\v 22 and Pharaoh laid a charge on all his people, saying, 'Every son who is born — into the River ye do cast him, and every daughter ye do keep alive.'
\c 2
\v 1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and he taketh the daughter of Levi,
\v 2 and the woman conceiveth, and beareth a son, and she saw him that he is fair, and she hideth him three months,
\v 3 and she had not been able any more to hide him, and she taketh for him an ark of rushes, and daubeth it with bitumen and with pitch, and putteth the lad in it, and putteth it in the weeds by the edge of the River;
\v 4 and his sister stationeth herself afar off, to know what is done to him.
\v 5 And a daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the River, and her damsels are walking by the side of the River, and she saw the ark in the middle of the weeds, and sent her handmaid, and she taketh it,
\v 6 and opened, and saw him — the lad, and lo, a child weeping! and she had pity on him, and said, 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.'
\v 7 And his sister said unto the daughter of Pharaoh, 'Do I go? when I have called for thee a suckling woman of the Hebrews, then she did suckle the lad for thee;'
\v 8 and the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, 'Go;' and the virgin went, and called the mother of the lad,
\v 9 and the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, 'Take this lad away, and suckle him for me, and I — I give your hire;' and the woman taketh the lad, and suckleth him.
\v 10 And the lad groweth, and she brought him in to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he is to her for a son, and she called his name Moses, and said, 'Because — from the water I have drawn him.'
\v 11 And it came to pass, in those days, that Moses is grown, and he went out unto his brethren, and looketh on their burdens, and saw a man, an Egyptian, smiting a man, a Hebrew, one of his brethren,
\v 12 and he turneth hither and thither, and saw that there is no man, and smiteth the Egyptian, and hideth him in the sand.
\v 13 And he went out on the second day, and lo, two men, Hebrews, striving! and he said to the wrong-doer, 'Why will you smite your neighbour?'
\v 14 and he said, 'Who set thee for a head and a judge over us? to slay me art you saying it, as you hast killed the Egyptian?' and Moses feareth, and said, 'Surely the thing had been known.'
\v 15 And Pharaoh heareth of this thing, and seeketh to slay Moses, and Moses fleeth from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelleth in the land of Midian, and dwelleth by the well.
\v 16 And to a priest of Midian are seven daughters, and they come and draw, and fill the troughs, to water the flock of their father,
\v 17 and the shepherds come and drive them away, and Moses ariseth, and saveth them, and watereth their flock.
\v 18 And they come in to Reuel their father, and he said, 'Wherefore have ye hastened to come in to-day?'
\v 19 and they say, 'A man, an Egyptian, had delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also had diligently drawn for us, and watereth the flock;'
\v 20 and he said unto his daughters, 'And where is he? why is this? — ye left the man! call for him, and he did eat bread.'
\v 21 And Moses is willing to dwell with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses,
\v 22 and she beareth a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, 'A sojourner I have been in a strange land.'
\v 23 And it came to pass during these many days, that the king of Egypt dieth, and the sons of Israel sigh because of the service, and cry, and their cry went up unto God, because of the service;
\v 24 and God heareth their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;
\v 25 and God saw the sons of Israel, and God knoweth.
\c 3
\v 1 And Moses had been feeding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, priest of Midian, and he leadeth the flock behind the wilderness, and came in unto the mount of God, to Horeb;
\v 2 and there appeareth unto him a messenger of Yahweh in a flame of fire, out of the middle of the bush, and he saw, and lo, the bush is burning with fire, and the bush is not consumed.
\v 3 And Moses said, 'Let me turn aside, I pray thee, and I see this great appearance; wherefore is the bush not burned?'
\v 4 and Yahweh saw that he had turned aside to see, and God called unto him out of the middle of the bush, and said, 'Moses, Moses;' and he said, 'Here am I.'
\v 5 And He said, 'Come not near hither: cast your shoes from off your feet, for the place on which you art standing is holy ground.'
\v 6 He said also, 'I am the God of your father, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob;' and Moses hideth his face, for he is afraid to look towards God.
\v 7 And Yahweh said, 'I have certainly seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and their cry I have heard, because of its exactors, for I have known its pains;
\v 8 and I go down to deliver it out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to cause it to go up out of the land, unto a land good and broad, unto a land flowing with milk and honey — unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\v 9 'And now, lo, the cry of the sons of Israel had come in unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them,
\v 10 and now, come, and I send thee unto Pharaoh, and bring you out My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.'
\v 11 And Moses said unto God, 'Who am I, that I go unto Pharaoh, and that I bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt?'
\v 12 and He said, 'Because I am with thee, and this is to thee the sign that I have sent thee: in your bringing out the people from Egypt — ye do serve God on this mount.'
\v 13 And Moses said unto God, 'Lo, I am coming unto the sons of Israel, and have said to them, The God of your fathers had sent me unto you, and they have said to me, What is His name? what do I say unto them?'
\v 14 And God said unto Moses, 'I AM THAT WHICH I AM;' He said also, 'Thus will you say to the sons of Israel, I AM had sent me unto you.'
\v 15 And God said again unto Moses, 'Thus will you say unto the sons of Israel, Yahweh, God of your fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, had sent me unto you; this is My name — to the age, and this My memorial, to generation — generation.
\v 16 'Go, and you hast gathered the elders of Israel, and hast said unto them: Yahweh, God of your fathers, had appeareth unto me, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have certainly inspected you, and that which is done to you in Egypt;
\v 17 and I say, I bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 18 'And they have hearkened to your voice, and you hast entered, you and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye have said unto him, Yahweh, God of the Hebrews, had met with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we sacrifice to Yahweh our God.
\v 19 And I — I have known that the king of Egypt did not permit you to go, unless by a strong hand,
\v 20 and I have put forth My hand, and have smitten Egypt with all My wonders, which I do in its middle — and afterwards he did send you away.
\v 21 'And I have given the grace of this people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it had come to pass, when ye go, ye go not empty;
\v 22 and every woman had asked from her neighbour, and from her who is sojourning in her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and ye have put them on your sons and on your daughters, and have spoiled the Egyptians.'
\c 4
\v 1 And Moses answereth and said, 'And, if they do not give credence to me, nor hearken to my voice, and say, Yahweh had not appeared unto thee?'
\v 2 And Yahweh said unto him, 'What is this in your hand?' and he said, 'A rod;'
\v 3 and He said, 'Cast it to the earth;' and he threw it to the earth, and it became a serpent — and Moses fleeth from its presence.
\v 4 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Put forth your hand, and lay hold on the tail of it;' and he putteth forth his hand, and laid hold on it, and it became a rod in his hand — 
\v 5  — so that they believe that Yahweh, God of their fathers, had appeared unto thee, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.'
\v 6 And Yahweh said to him again, 'Put in, I pray thee, your hand into your bosom;' and he putteth in his hand into his bosom, and he brought it out, and lo, his hand is leprous as snow;
\v 7 and He said, 'Put back your hand unto your bosom;' and he putteth back his hand unto his bosom, and he brought it out from his bosom, and lo, it had turned back as his flesh — 
\v 8  — and it had come to pass, if they do not give credence to thee, and hearken not to the voice of the first sign, that they have given credence to the voice of the latter sign.
\v 9 And it had come to pass, if they do not give credence even to these two signs, nor hearken to your voice, that you hast taken of the waters of the River, and hast poured on the dry land, and the waters which you takest from the River have been, yea, they have become — blood on the dry land.'
\v 10 And Moses said unto Yahweh, 'O, my Lord, I am not a man of words, either yesterday, or before, or since Your speaking unto Your servant, for I am slow of mouth, and slow of tongue.'
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto him, 'Who appointed a mouth for man? or who appointeth the dumb, or deaf, or open, or blind? is it not I, Yahweh?
\v 12 and now, go, and I — I am with your mouth, and have directed thee that which you speakest;'
\v 13 and he said, 'O, my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand Thou will send.'
\v 14 And the anger of Yahweh burneth against Moses, and He said, 'Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I have known that he spoke well, and also, lo, he is coming out to meet thee; when he had seen thee, then he had rejoiced in his heart,
\v 15 and you hast spoken unto him, and hast set the words in his mouth, and I — I am with your mouth, and with his mouth, and have directed you that which ye do;
\v 16 and he, he had spoken for thee unto the people, and it had come to pass, he — he is to thee for a mouth, and you — you art to him for God;
\v 17 and this rod you will take in your hand, with which you doest the signs.'
\v 18 And Moses went and turneth back unto Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, 'Let me go, I pray thee, and I turn back unto my brethren who are in Egypt, and I see whether they are yet alive.' And Jethro said to Moses, 'Go in peace.'
\v 19 And Yahweh said unto Moses in Midian, 'Go, turn back to Egypt, for all the men have died who seek your life;'
\v 20 and Moses taketh his wife, and his sons, and caused them to ride on the ass, and turneth back to the land of Egypt, and Moses taketh the rod of God in his hand.
\v 21 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'In your going to turn back to Egypt, see — all the wonders which I have put in your hand — that you hast done them before Pharaoh, and I — I strengthen his heart, and he did not send the people away;
\v 22 and you hast said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Yahweh, My son, My first-born is Israel,
\v 23 and I say unto thee, Send away My son, and he did serve Me; and — you will refuse to send him away — lo, I am slaying your son, your first-born.'
\v 24 And it came to pass in the way, in a lodging place, that Yahweh meeteth him, and seeketh to put him to death;
\v 25 and Zipporah taketh a flint, and cutteth off the foreskin of her son, and caused it to touch his feet, and said, 'Surely a bridegroom of blood art you to me;'
\v 26 and He desisteth from him: then she said, 'A bridegroom of blood,' in reference to the circumcision.
\v 27 And Yahweh said unto Aaron, 'Go to meet Moses into the wilderness;' and he went, and meeteth him in the mount of God, and kisseth him,
\v 28 and Moses declareth to Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which He had sent him, and all the signs with which He had charged him.
\v 29 And Moses went — Aaron also — and they gather all the elders of the sons of Israel,
\v 30 and Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people;
\v 31 and the people believe when they hear that Yahweh had looked after the sons of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction; and they bow and do obeisance.
\c 5
\v 1 And afterwards have Moses and Aaron entered, and they say unto Pharaoh, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Send My people away, and they keep a feast to Me in the wilderness;'
\v 2 and Pharaoh said, 'Who is Yahweh, that I hearken to His voice, to send Israel away? I have not known Yahweh, and Israel also I do not send away.'
\v 3 And they say, 'The God of the Hebrews had met with us, let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest He meet us with pestilence or with sword.'
\v 4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, 'Why, Moses and Aaron, do ye free the people from its works? go to your burdens.'
\v 5 Pharaoh also said, 'Lo, numerous now is the people of the land, and ye have caused them to cease from their burdens!'
\v 6 And Pharaoh commandeth, on that day, the exactors among the people and its authorities, saying,
\v 7 Ye do not add to give straw to the people for the making of the bricks, as heretofore — they go and have gathered straw for themselves;
\v 8 and the proper quantity of the bricks which they are making heretofore ye do put on them, ye do not diminish from it, for they are remiss, therefore they are crying, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God;
\v 9 let the service be heavy on the men, and let them work at it, and not be dazzled by lying words.'
\v 10 And the exactors of the people, and its authorities, go out, and speak unto the people, saying, 'Thus said Pharaoh, I do not give you straw,
\v 11 ye — go ye, take for yourselves straw where ye find it, for there is nothing of your service diminished.'
\v 12 And the people is scattered over all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw,
\v 13 and the exactors are making haste, saying, 'Complete your works, the matter of a day in its day, as when there is straw.'
\v 14 And the authorities of the sons of Israel, whom the exactors of Pharaoh have placed over them, are beaten, saying, 'Wherefore have ye not completed your portion in making brick as heretofore, both yesterday and to-day?'
\v 15 And the authorities of the sons of Israel come in and cry unto Pharaoh, saying, 'Why will you thus to your servants?
\v 16 Straw is not given to your servants, and they are saying to us, Make bricks, and lo, your servants are smitten — and your people had sinned.'
\v 17 And he said, 'Remiss — ye are remiss, therefore ye are saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Yahweh;
\v 18 and now, go, serve; and straw is not given to you, and the measure of bricks ye do give.'
\v 19 And the authorities of the sons of Israel see them in affliction, saying, 'Ye do not diminish from your bricks; the matter of a day in its day.'
\v 20 And they meet Moses and Aaron standing to meet them, in their coming out from Pharaoh,
\v 21 and say unto them, 'Yahweh look upon you, and judge, because ye have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants — to give a sword into their hand to slay us.'
\v 22 And Moses turneth back unto Yahweh, and said, 'Lord, why hast Thou done evil to this people? why is this? — Thou hast sent me!
\v 23 and since I have come unto Pharaoh, to speak in Your name, he had done evil to this people, and Thou hast not at all delivered Your people.'
\c 6
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Now will you see that which I do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand he did send them away, yea, with a strong hand he did cast them out of his land.'
\v 2 And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him, 'I am Yahweh,
\v 3 and I appear unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; as to My name Yahweh, I have not been known to them;
\v 4 and also I have established My covenant with them, to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they have sojourned;
\v 5 and also I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are causing to serve, and I remember My covenant.
\v 6 Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I am Yahweh, and I have brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and have delivered you from their service, and have redeemed you by a stretched-out arm, and by great judgments,
\v 7 and have taken you to Me for a people, and I have been to you for God, and ye have known that I am Yahweh your God, who is bringing you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians;
\v 8 and I have brought you in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and have given it to you — a possession; I am Yahweh.'
\v 9 And Moses spoke so unto the sons of Israel, and they hearkened not unto Moses, for anguish of spirit, and for harsh service.
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 11 'Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he did send the sons of Israel out of his land;
\v 12 and Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, 'Lo, the sons of Israel have not hearkened unto me, and how did Pharaoh hear me, and I of uncircumcised lips?'
\v 13 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and chargeth them for the sons of Israel, and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt.
\v 14 These are heads of the house of their fathers: Sons of Reuben first-born of Israel are Hanoch, and Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are families of Reuben.
\v 15 And sons of Simeon are Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, son of the Canaanitess: these are families of Simeon.
\v 16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi, as to their births: Gershon, and Kohad, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi are a hundred and thirty and seven years.
\v 17 The sons of Gershon are Libni, and Shimi, as to their families.
\v 18 And the sons of Kohad are Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohad are a hundred and thirty and three years.
\v 19 And the sons of Merari are Mahli and Mushi: these are families of Levi, as to their births.
\v 20 And Amram taketh Jochebed his aunt to himself for a wife, and she beareth to him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram are a hundred and thirty and seven years.
\v 21 And sons of Izhar are Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
\v 22 And sons of Uzziel are Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.
\v 23 And Aaron taketh Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to himself for a wife, and she beareth to him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\v 24 And sons of Korah are Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are families of the Korhite.
\v 25 And Eleazar, Aaron's son, had taken to him one of the daughters of Putiel for a wife to himself, and she beareth to him Phinehas: these are heads of the fathers of the Levites, as to their families.
\v 26 This is Aaron — and Moses — to whom Yahweh said, 'Bring ye out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, by their hosts;'
\v 27 these are they who are speaking unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt, this is Moses — and Aaron.
\v 28 And it came to pass in the day of Yahweh's speaking unto Moses in the land of Egypt,
\v 29 that Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying, 'I am Yahweh, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I am speaking unto thee.'
\v 30 And Moses said before Yahweh, 'Lo, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how did Pharaoh hearken unto me?'
\c 7
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'See, I have given thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother is your prophet;
\v 2 you — you will speak all that I command thee, and Aaron your brother did speak unto Pharaoh, and he had sent the sons of Israel out of his land.
\v 3 'And I harden the heart of Pharaoh, and have multiplied My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt,
\v 4 and Pharaoh did not hearken, and I have put My hand on Egypt, and have brought out My hosts, My people, the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments;
\v 5 and the Egyptians have known that I am Yahweh, in My stretching out My hand against Egypt; and I have brought out the sons of Israel from their middle.'
\v 6 And Moses did — Aaron also — as Yahweh commanded them; so have they done;
\v 7 and Moses is a son of eighty years, and Aaron is a son of eighty and three years, in their speaking unto Pharaoh.
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 9 When Pharaoh spoke unto you, saying, Give for yourselves a wonder; then you hast said unto Aaron, Take your rod, and cast before Pharaoh — it became a monster.'
\v 10 And Moses went in — Aaron also — unto Pharaoh, and they do so as Yahweh had commanded; and Aaron threw his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a monster.
\v 11 And Pharaoh also called for wise men, and for sorcerers; and the scribes of Egypt, they also, with their flashings, do so,
\v 12 and they cast down each his rod, and they become monsters, and the rod of Aaron swalloweth their rods;
\v 13 and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he had not hearkened unto them, as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'The heart of Pharaoh had been hard, he had refused to send the people away;
\v 15 go unto Pharaoh in the morning, lo, he is going out to the water, and you hast stood to meet him by the edge of the River, and the rod which was turned to a serpent you will take in your hand,
\v 16 and you hast said unto him: Yahweh, God of the Hebrews, had sent me unto thee, saying, Send My people away, and they serve Me in the wilderness; and lo, you hast not hearkened hitherto.
\v 17 Thus said Yahweh: By this you knowest that I am Yahweh; lo, I am smiting with the rod which is in my hand, on the waters which are in the River, and they have been turned to blood,
\v 18 and the fish that are in the River die, and the River had stank, and the Egyptians have been wearied of drinking waters from the River.'
\v 19 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Say unto Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand against the waters of Egypt, against their streams, against their rivers, and against their ponds, and against all their collections of waters; and they are blood — and there had been blood in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in those of stone.'
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron do so, as Yahweh had commanded, and he lifteth up his hand with the rod, and smiteth the waters which are in the River, before the eyes of Pharaoh, and before the eyes of his servants, and all the waters which are in the River are turned to blood,
\v 21 and the fish which is in the River had died, and the River stinketh, and the Egyptians have not been able to drink water from the River; and the blood is in all the land of Egypt.
\v 22 And the scribes of Egypt do so with their flashings, and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he had not hearkened unto them, as Yahweh had spoken,
\v 23 and Pharaoh turneth and went in unto his house, and had not set his heart even to this;
\v 24 and all the Egyptians seek water round about the river to drink, for they have not been able to drink of the waters of the River.
\v 25 And seven days are completed after Yahweh's smiting the River,
\c 8
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go in unto Pharaoh: and you hast said unto him, Thus said Yahweh, Send My people away, and they serve Me;
\v 2 and if you art refusing to send away, lo, I am smiting all your border with frogs;
\v 3 and the River had teemed with frogs, and they have gone up and gone into your house, and into the inner-chamber of your bed, and on your couch, and into the house of your servants, and among your people, and into yours ovens, and into your kneading-troughs;
\v 4 yea, on thee, and on your people, and on all your servants do the frogs go up.'
\v 5 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Say unto Aaron, Stretch out your hand, with your rod, against the streams, against the rivers, and against the ponds, and cause the frogs to come up against the land of Egypt.'
\v 6 And Aaron stretcheth out his hand against the waters of Egypt, and the frog came up, and covereth the land of Egypt;
\v 7 and the scribes do so with their flashings, and cause the frogs to come up against the land of Egypt.
\v 8 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, 'Make supplication unto Yahweh, that he turn aside the frogs from me, and from my people, and I send the people away, and they sacrifice to Yahweh.'
\v 9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, 'Beautify yourself over me; when do I make supplication for thee, and for your servants, and for your people, to cut off the frogs from thee and from your houses — only in the River they do remain?'
\v 10 and he said, 'To-morrow.' And he said, According to your word it is, so that you knowest that there is none like Yahweh our God,
\v 11 and the frogs have turned aside from thee, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; only in the River they do remain.'
\v 12 And Moses — Aaron also — went out from Pharaoh, and Moses crieth unto Yahweh, concerning the matter of the frogs which He had set on Pharaoh;
\v 13 and Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs die out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields,
\v 14 and they heap them up together, and the land stinketh.
\v 15 And Pharaoh saw that there had been a respite, and he had hardened his heart, and had not hearkened unto them, as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 16 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Say unto Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and smite the dust of the land, and it had become gnats in all the land of Egypt.'
\v 17 And they do so, and Aaron stretcheth out his hand with his rod, and smiteth the dust of the land, and the gnats are on man and on beast; all the dust of the land had been gnats in all the land of Egypt.
\v 18 And the scribes do so with their flashings, to bring out the gnats, and they have not been able, and the gnats are on man and on beast;
\v 19 and the scribes say unto Pharaoh, 'It is the finger of God;' and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he had not hearkened unto them, as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 20 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Rise early in the morning, and station yourself before Pharaoh, lo, he is going out to the waters, and you hast said unto him, Thus said Yahweh, Send My people away, and they serve Me;
\v 21 for, if you art not sending My people away, lo, I am sending against thee, and against your servants, and against your people, and against your houses, the beetle, and the houses of the Egyptians have been full of the beetle, and also the ground on which they are.
\v 22 And I have separated in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people are staying, that the beetle is not there, so that you knowest that I am Yahweh in the middle of the land,
\v 23 and I have put a division between My people and your people: to-morrow is this sign.'
\v 24 And Yahweh did so, and the grievous beetle entereth the house of Pharaoh, and the house of his servants, and in all the land of Egypt the land is corrupted from the presence of the beetle.
\v 25 And Pharaoh called unto Moses and to Aaron, and said, 'Go, sacrifice to your God in the land;'
\v 26 and Moses said, 'Not right to do so, for the abomination of the Egyptians we do sacrifice to Yahweh our God; lo, we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes — and they do not stone us!
\v 27 A journey of three days we go into the wilderness, and have sacrificed to Yahweh our God, as He said unto us.'
\v 28 And Pharaoh said, 'I send you away, and ye have sacrificed to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only go not very far off; make ye supplication for me;'
\v 29 and Moses said, 'Lo, I am going out from thee, and have made supplication unto Yahweh, and the beetle had turned aside from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people — to-morrow, only let not Pharaoh add to deceive — in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Yahweh.'
\v 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and made supplication unto Yahweh,
\v 31 and Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and turneth aside the beetle from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people — there had not been left one;
\v 32 and Pharaoh hardeneth his heart also at this time, and had not sent the people away.
\c 9
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go in unto Pharaoh, and you hast spoken unto him, Thus said Yahweh, God of the Hebrews, Send My people away, and they serve me,
\v 2 for, if you art refusing to send away, and art still keeping hold upon them,
\v 3 lo, the hand of Yahweh is on your cattle which are in the field, on horses, on asses, on camels, on herd, and on flock — a pestilence very grievous.
\v 4 'And Yahweh had separated between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and there did not die a thing of all the sons of Israel's;
\v 5 and Yahweh setteth an appointed time, saying, To-morrow did Yahweh do this thing in the land.'
\v 6 And Yahweh did this thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt die, and of the cattle of the sons of Israel not one had died;
\v 7 and Pharaoh sent, and lo, not even one of the cattle of Israel had died, and the heart of Pharaoh is hard, and he had not sent the people away.
\v 8 And Yahweh said unto Moses and unto Aaron, 'Take to you the fulness of your hands of soot of a furnace, and Moses had sprinkled it towards the heavens, before the eyes of Pharaoh,
\v 9 and it had become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and it had become on man and on cattle a boil breaking forth with blains, in all the land of Egypt.'
\v 10 And they take the soot of the furnace, and stand before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkleth it towards the heavens, and it is a boil with blains, breaking forth, on man and on beast;
\v 11 and the scribes have not been able to stand before Moses, because of the boil, for the boil had been on the scribes, and on all the Egyptians.
\v 12 And Yahweh strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh, and he had not hearkened unto them, as Yahweh had spoken unto Moses.
\v 13 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Rise early in the morning, and station yourself before Pharaoh, and you hast said unto him, Thus said Yahweh, God of the Hebrews, Send My people away, and they serve Me,
\v 14 for, at this time I am sending all My plagues unto your heart, and on your servants, and on your people, so that you knowest that there is none like Me in all the earth,
\v 15 for now I have put forth My hand, and I smite thee, and your people, with pestilence, and you art hidden from the earth.
\v 16 'And yet for this I have caused thee to stand, so as to show thee My power, and for the sake of declaring My Name in all the earth;
\v 17 still you art exalting yourself against My people — so as not to send them away;
\v 18 lo, I am raining about this time to-morrow hail very grievous, such as had not been in Egypt, even from the day of its being founded, even until now.
\v 19 And, now, send, strengthen your cattle and all that you hast in the field; every man and beast which is found in the field, and is not gathered into the house — come down on them had the hail, and they have died.'
\v 20 He who is fearing the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh had caused his servants and his cattle to flee unto the houses;
\v 21 and he who had not set his heart unto the word of Yahweh leaveth his servants and his cattle in the field.
\v 22 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Stretch forth your hand towards the heavens, and there is hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on beast, and on every herb of the field in the land of Egypt.'
\v 23 And Moses stretcheth out his rod towards the heavens, and Yahweh had given voices and hail, and fire went towards the earth, and Yahweh raineth hail on the land of Egypt,
\v 24 and there is hail, and fire catching itself in the middle of the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
\v 25 And the hail smiteth in all the land of Egypt all that is in the field, from man even unto beast, and every herb of the field had the hail smitten, and every tree of the field it had broken;
\v 26 only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel are, there had been no hail.
\v 27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and for Aaron, and said unto them, 'I have sinned this time, Yahweh is the Righteous, and I and my people are the Wicked,
\v 28 make ye supplication unto Yahweh, and plead that there be no voices of God and hail, and I send you away, and ye add not to remain.'
\v 29 And Moses said unto him, 'At my going out of the city, I spread my palms unto Yahweh — the voices cease, and the hail is not any more, so that you knowest that the earth is Yahweh's;
\v 30 but you and your servants — I have known that ye are not yet afraid of the face of Yahweh God.'
\v 31 And the flax and the barley have been smitten, for the barley is budding, and the flax forming flowers,
\v 32 and the wheat and the rye have not been smitten, for they are late.
\v 33 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, from the city, and spreadeth his hands unto Yahweh, and the voices and the hail cease, and rain had not been poured out to the earth;
\v 34 and Pharaoh saw that the rain had ceased, and the hail and the voices, and he continueth to sin, and hardeneth his heart, he and his servants;
\v 35 and the heart of Pharaoh is strong, and he had not sent the sons of Israel away, as Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Moses.
\c 10
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go in unto Pharaoh, for I have declared hard his heart, and the heart of his servants, so that I set these My signs in their middle,
\v 2 and so that you recountest in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, that which I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have set among them, and ye have known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 3 And Moses came in — Aaron also — unto Pharaoh, and they say unto him, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of the Hebrews, Until when hast you refused to be humbled at My presence? send My people away, and they serve Me,
\v 4 for if you art refusing to send My people away, lo, I am bringing in to-morrow the locust into your border,
\v 5 and it had covered the eye of the land, and none is able to see the land, and it had eaten the remnant of that which is escaped, which is left to you from the hail, and it had eaten every tree which is springing for you out of the field;
\v 6 and they have filled your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither your fathers nor your father's fathers have seen, since the day of their being on the ground unto this day,' — and he turneth and went out from Pharaoh.
\v 7 And the servants of Pharaoh say unto him, 'Until when did this one become a snare to us? send the men away, and they serve Yahweh their God; knowest you not yet that Egypt had perished?'
\v 8 And Moses is brought back — Aaron also — unto Pharaoh, and he said unto them, 'Go, serve Yahweh your God; — who and who are those going?'
\v 9 And Moses said, 'With our young ones, and with our aged ones, we go, with our sons, and with our daughters, with our flock, and our herd, we go, for we have a festival to Yahweh.'
\v 10 And he said unto them, 'Be it so, Yahweh be with you when I send you and your infants away; see — for evil is before your faces;
\v 11 not so! go now, ye who are men, and serve Yahweh, for that ye are seeking;' and one threw them out from the presence of Pharaoh.
\v 12 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Stretch out your hand against the land of Egypt for the locust, and it went up against the land of Egypt, and did eat every herb of the land — all that the hail had left.'
\v 13 And Moses stretcheth out his rod against the land of Egypt, and Yahweh had led an east wind over the land all that day, and all the night; the morning had been, and the east wind had lifted up the locust.
\v 14 And the locust went up against all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the border of Egypt — very grievous: before it there had not been such a locust as it, and after it there is none such;
\v 15 and it covereth the eye of all the land, and the land is darkened; and it eateth every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and there had not been left any green thing in the trees, or in the herb of the field, in all the land of Egypt.'
\v 16 And Pharaoh hasteth to call for Moses and for Aaron, and said, 'I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you,
\v 17 and now, bear with, I pray you, my sin, only this time, and make ye supplication to Yahweh your God, that He turn aside from off me only this death.'
\v 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and made supplication unto Yahweh,
\v 19 and Yahweh turneth a very strong sea wind, and it lifteth up the locust, and bloweth it into the Red Sea — there had not been left one locust in all the border of Egypt;
\v 20 and Yahweh strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh, and he had not sent the sons of Israel away.
\v 21 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Stretch out your hand towards the heavens, and there is darkness over the land of Egypt, and the darkness is felt.'
\v 22 And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the heavens, and there is darkness — thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;
\v 23 they have not seen one another, and none had risen from his place three days; and to all the sons of Israel there had been light in their dwellings.'
\v 24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, 'Go ye, serve Yahweh, only your flock and your herd are stayed, your infants also go with you;'
\v 25 and Moses said, 'Thou also will give in our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and we have prepared for Yahweh our God;
\v 26 and also our cattle did go with us, there is not left a hoof, for from it we do take to serve Yahweh our God; and we — we know not how we do serve Yahweh till our going thither.'
\v 27 And Yahweh strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh, and he had not been willing to send them away;
\v 28 and Pharaoh said to him, 'Go from me, take heed to yourself, add not to see my face, for in the day you seest my face you diest;'
\v 29 and Moses said, 'Rightly hast you spoken, I add not any more to see your face.'
\c 11
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'One plague more I do bring in on Pharaoh, and on Egypt, afterwards he did send you away from this; when he is sending you away, he surely threw you out altogether from this place;
\v 2 speak, I pray thee, in the ears of the people, and they ask — each man from his neighbour, and each woman from her neighbour, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold.'
\v 3 And Yahweh gave the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses is very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of the people.
\v 4 And Moses said, 'Thus said Yahweh, About midnight I am going out into the middle of Egypt,
\v 5 and every first-born in the land of Egypt had died, from the first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the first-born of the maid-servant who is behind the millstones, and all the first-born of beasts;
\v 6 and there had been a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there had not been, and such as there is not again.
\v 7 'And against all the sons of Israel a dog sharpeneth not its tongue, from man even unto beast, so that ye know that Yahweh did make a separation between the Egyptians and Israel;
\v 8 and all these your servants have come down unto me, and bowed themselves to me, saying, Go out, you and all the people who are at your feet; and afterwards I do go out;' — and he went out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger.
\v 9 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Pharaoh did not hearken unto you, so as to multiply My wonders in the land of Egypt;'
\v 10 and Moses and Aaron have done all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh strengtheneth Pharaoh's heart, and he had not sent the sons of Israel out of his land.
\c 12
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, in the land of Egypt, saying,
\v 2 This month is to you the chief of months — it is the first to you of the months of the year;
\v 3 speak ye unto all the company of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month — they take to them each man a lamb for the house of the fathers, a lamb for a house.
\v 4 '(And if the household be too few for a lamb, then had he taken, he and his neighbour who is near unto his house, for the number of persons, each according to his eating ye do count for the lamb,)
\v 5 a lamb, a perfect one, a male, a son of a year, let be to you; from the sheep or from the goats ye do take it.
\v 6 'And it had become a charge to you, until the fourteenth day of this month, and the whole assembly of the company of Israel have slaughtered it between the evenings;
\v 7 and they have taken of the blood, and have put on the two side-posts, and on the lintel over the houses in which they eat it.
\v 8 'And they have eaten the flesh in this night, roast with fire; with unleavened things and bitters they do eat it;
\v 9 ye do not eat of it raw, or boiled at all in water, but roast with fire, its head with its legs, and with its inwards;
\v 10 and ye do not leave of it till morning, and that which is remaining of it till morning with fire ye do burn.
\v 11 'And thus ye do eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and ye have eaten it in haste; it is Yahweh's passover,
\v 12 and I have passed over through the land of Egypt during this night, and have smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from man even unto beast, and on all the gods of Egypt I do judgments; I am Yahweh.
\v 13 And the blood had become a sign for you on the houses where ye are, and I have seen the blood, and have passed over you, and a plague is not on you for destruction in My smiting in the land of Egypt.
\v 14 And this day had become to you a memorial, and ye have kept it a feast to Yahweh to your generations; — a statute age-during; ye keep it a feast.
\v 15 Seven days ye eat unleavened things; only — in the first day ye cause leaven to cease out of your houses; for any one eating anything fermented from the first day till the seventh day, even that person had been cut off from Israel.
\v 16 And in the first day is a holy convocation, and in the seventh day ye have a holy convocation; any work is not done in them, only that which is eaten by any person — it alone is done by you,
\v 17 and ye have observed the unleavened things, for in this self-same day I have brought out your hosts from the land of Egypt, and ye have observed this day to your generations — a statute age-during.
\v 18 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye do eat unleavened things until the one and twentieth day of the month, at evening;
\v 19 seven days leaven is not found in your houses, for any one eating anything fermented — that person had been cut off from the company of Israel, among the sojourners or among the natives of the land;
\v 20 anything fermented ye do not eat, in all your dwellings ye do eat unleavened things.'
\v 21 And Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, 'Draw out and take for yourselves from the flock, for your families, and slaughter the passover-sacrifice;
\v 22 and ye have taken a bunch of hyssop, and have dipped it in the blood which is in the basin, and have struck it on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, from the blood which is in the basin, and ye, ye go not out each from the opening of his house till morning.
\v 23 'And Yahweh had passed on to smite the Egyptians, and had seen the blood on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, and Yahweh had passed over the opening, and did not permit the destruction to come into your houses to smite.
\v 24 And ye have observed this thing, for a statute to thee, and to your sons — unto the age;
\v 25 and it had been, when ye come in unto the land which Yahweh gave to you, as He had spoken, that ye have kept this service;
\v 26 and it had come to pass when your sons say unto you, What is this service ye have?
\v 27 that ye have said, A sacrifice of passover it is to Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, in His smiting the Egyptians, and our houses He delivered.'
\v 28 And the people bow and do obeisance, and the sons of Israel go and do as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done.
\v 29 And it came to pass, at midnight, that Yahweh had smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the first-born of the captive who is in the prison-house, and every first-born of beasts.
\v 30 And Pharaoh riseth by night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there is a great cry in Egypt, for there is not a house where there is not one dead,
\v 31 and he called for Moses and for Aaron by night, and said, 'Rise, go out from the middle of my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve Yahweh according to your word;
\v 32 both your flock and your herd take ye, as ye have spoken, and go; then ye have blessed also me.'
\v 33 And the Egyptians are urgent on the people, hasting to send them away out of the land, for they said, 'We are all dead;'
\v 34 and the people taketh up its dough before it is fermented, their kneading-troughs are bound up in their garments on their shoulder.
\v 35 And the sons of Israel have done according to the word of Moses, and they ask from the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments;
\v 36 and Yahweh had given the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they cause them to ask, and they spoil the Egyptians.
\v 37 And the sons of Israel journey from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred yousand men on foot, apart from infants;
\v 38 and a great rabble also had gone up with them, and flock and herd — very much cattle.
\v 39 And they bake with the dough which they have brought out from Egypt unleavened cakes, for it had not fermented; for they have been cast out of Egypt, and have not been able to delay, and also provision they have not made for themselves.
\v 40 And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they have dwelt in Egypt is four hundred and thirty years;
\v 41 and it came to pass, at the end of four hundred and thirty years — yea, it came to pass in this self-same day — all the hosts of Yahweh have gone out from the land of Egypt.
\v 42 A night of watchings it is to Yahweh, to bring them out from the land of Egypt; it is this night to Yahweh of watchings to all the sons of Israel to their generations.
\v 43 And Yahweh said unto Moses and Aaron, 'This is a statute of the passover; Any son of a stranger did not eat of it;
\v 44 and any man's servant, the purchase of money, when you hast circumcised him — then he did eat of it;
\v 45 a settler or hired servant did not eat of it;
\v 46 in one house it is eaten, you will not carry out of the house any of the flesh wiyout, and a bone ye do not break of it;
\v 47 all the company of Israel do keep it.
\v 48 And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and had made a passover to Yahweh, every male of his is to be circumcised, and then he did come near to keep it, and he had been as a native of the land, but any uncircumcised one did not eat of it;
\v 49 one law is to a native, and to a sojourner who is sojourning in your middle.'
\v 50 And all the sons of Israel do as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done.
\v 51 And it came to pass in this self-same day, Yahweh had brought out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, by their hosts.
\c 13
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Sanctify to Me every first-born, opening any womb among the sons of Israel, among man and among beast; it is Mine.'
\v 3 And Moses said unto the people, 'Remember this day in which ye have gone out from Egypt, from the house of servants, for by strength of hand had Yahweh brought you out from this, and any thing fermented is not eaten;
\v 4 To-day ye are going out, in the month of Abib.
\v 5 'And it had been, when Yahweh brought thee in unto the land of the Canaanite, and of the Hittite, and of the Amorite, and of the Hivite, and of the Jebusite, which He had sworn to your fathers to give to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you hast done this service in this month.
\v 6 Seven days you will eat unleavened things, and in the seventh day is a feast to Yahweh;
\v 7 unleavened things are eaten the seven days, and any thing fermented is not seen with thee; yea, leaven is not seen with thee in all your border.
\v 8 And you hast declared to your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of what Yahweh did to me, in my going out from Egypt,
\v 9 and it had been to thee for a sign on your hand, and for a memorial between yours eyes, so that the law of Yahweh is in your mouth, for by a strong hand had Yahweh brought thee out from Egypt;
\v 10 and you hast kept this statute at its appointed season from days to days.
\v 11 'And it had been, when Yahweh brought thee in unto the land of the Canaanite, as He had sworn to thee and to your fathers, and had given it to thee,
\v 12 that you hast caused every one opening a womb to pass over to Yahweh, and every firstling — the increase of beasts which you hast: the males are Yahweh's.
\v 13 And every firstling of an ass you will ransom with a lamb, and if you will not ransom it, then you hast beheaded it: and every first-born of man among your sons you will ransom.
\v 14 And it had been, when your son asketh thee hereafter, saying, What is this? that you hast said unto him, By strength of hand had Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from a house of servants;
\v 15 yea, it came to pass, when Pharaoh had been pained to send us away, that Yahweh did slay every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man even unto the first-born of beast; therefore I am sacrificing to Yahweh all opening a womb who are males, and every first-born of my sons I ransom;
\v 16 and it had been for a token on your hand, and for frontlets between yours eyes, for by strength of hand had Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.'
\v 17 And it came to pass in Pharaoh's sending the people away, that God had not led them the way of the land of the Philistines, for it is near; for God said, 'Lest the people repent in their seeing war, and have turned back towards Egypt;'
\v 18 and God turneth round the people the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea, and by fifties have the sons of Israel gone up from the land of Egypt.
\v 19 And Moses taketh the bones of Joseph with him, for he certainly caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, 'God did certainly inspect you, and ye have brought up my bones from this with you.'
\v 20 And they journey from Succoth, and encamp in Etham at the extremity of the wilderness,
\v 21 and Yahweh is going before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give light to them, to go by day and by night;
\v 22 He removeth not the pillar of the cloud by day, and the pillar of the fire by night, from before the people.
\c 14
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they turn back and encamp before Pi-Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-Zephon; over-against it ye do encamp by the sea,
\v 3 and Pharaoh had said of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness had shut upon them;
\v 4 and I have strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he had pursued after them, and I am honoured on Pharaoh, and on all his force, and the Egyptians have known that I am Yahweh;' and they do so.
\v 5 And it is declared to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants is turned against the people, and they say, 'What is this we have done? that we have sent Israel away from our service.'
\v 6 And he harnesseth his chariot, and his people he had taken with him,
\v 7 and he taketh six hundred chosen chariots, even all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over them all;
\v 8 and Yahweh strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursueth after the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel are going out with a high hand,
\v 9 and the Egyptians pursue after them, and all the chariot horses of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his force, overtake them, encamping by the sea, by Pi-Hahiroth, before Baal-Zephon.
\v 10 And Pharaoh had drawn near, and the sons of Israel lift up their eyes, and lo, the Egyptians are journeying after them, and they fear exceedingly, and the sons of Israel cry unto Yahweh.
\v 11 And they say unto Moses, 'Because there are no graves in Egypt, hast you taken us away to die in a wilderness? what is this you hast done to us — to bring us out from Egypt?
\v 12 Is not this the word which we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Cease from us, and we serve the Egyptians; for better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in a wilderness?'
\v 13 And Moses said unto the people, 'Fear not, station yourselves, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which He did for you to-day; for, as ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye add no more to see them — to the age;
\v 14 Yahweh did fight for you, and ye keep silent.'
\v 15 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'What? you criest unto Me — speak unto the sons of Israel, and they journey;
\v 16 and you, lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand towards the sea, and cleave it, and the sons of Israel go into the middle of the sea on dry land.
\v 17 And I — lo, I am strengthening the heart of the Egyptians, and they go in after them, and I am honoured on Pharaoh, and on all his force, on his chariots, and on his horsemen;
\v 18 and the Egyptians have known that I am Yahweh, in My being honoured on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.'
\v 19 And the messenger of God, who is going before the camp of Israel, journeyeth and went at their rear; and the pillar of the cloud journeyeth from their front, and standeth at their rear,
\v 20 and came in between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and the cloud and the darkness are, and he enlighteneth the night, and the one had not drawn near unto the other all the night.
\v 21 And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go on by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea become dry ground, and the waters are cleaved,
\v 22 and the sons of Israel go into the middle of the sea, on dry land, and the waters are to them a wall, on their right and on their left.
\v 23 And the Egyptians pursue, and go in after them (all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen) unto the middle of the sea,
\v 24 and it came to pass, in the morning watch, that Yahweh looketh unto the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubleth the camp of the Egyptians,
\v 25 and turneth aside the wheels of their chariots, and they lead them with difficulty, and the Egyptians say, 'Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh is fighting for them against the Egyptians.'
\v 26 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Stretch out your hand toward the sea, and the waters turn back on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.'
\v 27 And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea, and the sea turneth back, at the turning of the morning, to its perennial flow, and the Egyptians are fleeing at its coming, and Yahweh shaketh off the Egyptians in the middle of the sea,
\v 28 and the waters turn back, and cover the chariots and the horsemen, even all the force of Pharaoh, who are coming in after them into the sea — there had not been left of them even one.
\v 29 And the sons of Israel have gone on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters are to them a wall, on their right and on their left;
\v 30 and Yahweh saveth Israel in that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore,
\v 31 and Israel saw the great hand with which Yahweh had wrought against the Egyptians, and the people fear Yahweh, and remain stedfast in Yahweh, and in Moses His servant.
\c 15
\v 1 Then singeth Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Yahweh, and they speak, saying: — 'I sing to Yahweh, For triumphing He had triumphed; The horse and its rider He had thrown into the sea.
\v 2 My strength and song is JAH, And He is become my salvation: This is my God, and I glorify Him; God of my father, and I exalt Him.
\v 3 Yahweh is a man of battle; Yahweh is His name.
\v 4 Chariots of Pharaoh and his force He had cast into the sea; And the choice of his captains Have sunk in the Red Sea!
\v 5 The depths do cover them; They went down into the depths as a stone.
\v 6 Your right hand, O Yahweh, Is become honourable in power; Your right hand, O Yahweh, Doth crush an enemy.
\v 7 And in the abundance of Thine excellency Thou throwest down Your withstanders, Thou sendest forth Your wrath — It consumeth them as stubble.
\v 8 And by the spirit of Thine anger Have waters been heaped together; Stood as a heap have flowings; Congealed have been depths In the heart of a sea.
\v 9 The enemy said, I pursue, I overtake; I apportion spoil; Filled is my soul with them; I draw out my sword; My hand destroyeth them: — 
\v 10 Thou hast blown with Your wind The sea had covered them; They sank as lead in mighty waters.
\v 11 Who is like Thee among the gods, O Yahweh? Who is like Thee — honourable in holiness — Fearful in praises — doing wonders?
\v 12 Thou hast stretched out Your right hand — Earth swalloweth them!
\v 13 Thou hast led forth in Your kindness The people whom Thou hast redeemed. Thou hast led on in Your strength Unto Your holy habitation.
\v 14 Peoples have heard, they are troubled; Pain had seized inhabitants of Philistia.
\v 15 Then have chiefs of Edom been troubled: Mighty ones of Moab — Trembling did seize them! Melted have all inhabitants of Canaan!
\v 16 Fall on them did terror and dread; By the greatness of Thine arm They are still as a stone, Till Your people pass over, O Yahweh; Till the people pass over Whom Thou hast purchased.
\v 17 Thou will bring them in, And will plant them In a mountain of Thine inheritance, A fixed place for Your dwelling Thou hast made, O Yahweh; A sanctuary, O Lord, Your hands have established;
\v 18 Yahweh reigneth — to the age, and for ever!'
\v 19 For the horse of Pharaoh had gone in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh turneth back on them the waters of the sea, and the sons of Israel have gone on dry land in the middle of the sea.
\v 20 And Miriam the inspired one, sister of Aaron, taketh the timbrel in her hand, and all the women go out after her, with timbrels and with choruses;
\v 21 and Miriam answereth to them: — 'Sing ye to Yahweh, For Triumphing He had triumphed; The horse and its rider He had thrown into the sea!'
\v 22 And Moses caused Israel to journey from the Red Sea, and they go out unto the wilderness of Shur, and they go three days in the wilderness, and have not found water,
\v 23 and they come in to Marah, and have not been able to drink the waters of Marah, for they are bitter; therefore had one called its name Marah.
\v 24 And the people murmur against Moses, saying, 'What do we drink?'
\v 25 and he crieth unto Yahweh, and Yahweh sheweth him a tree, and he threw unto the waters, and the waters become sweet. There He had made for them a statute, and an ordinance, and there He had tried them,
\v 26 and He said, 'If you will really hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will that which is right in His eyes, and hast hearkened to His commands, and kept all His statutes: none of the sickness which I laid on the Egyptians do I lay on thee, for I, Yahweh, am healing thee.
\v 27 And they come to Elim, and there are twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees; and they encamp there by the waters.
\c 16
\v 1 And they journey from Elim, and all the company of the sons of Israel come in unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out from the land of Egypt.
\v 2 And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
\v 3 and the sons of Israel say unto them, 'Oh that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, in our sitting by the flesh-pot, in our eating bread to satiety — for ye have brought us out unto this wilderness to put all this assembly to death with hunger.'
\v 4 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Lo, I am raining to you bread from the heavens — and the people have gone out and gathered the matter of a day in its day — so that I try them whether they walk in My law, or not;
\v 5 and it had been on the sixth day, that they have prepared that which they bring in, and it had been double above that which they gather day by day.'
\v 6 And Moses said — Aaron also — unto all the sons of Israel, 'Evening — and ye have known that Yahweh had brought you out from the land of Egypt;
\v 7 and morning — and ye have seen the honour of Yahweh, in His hearing your murmurings against Yahweh, and what are we, that ye murmur against us?'
\v 8 And Moses said, 'In Yahweh's giving to you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety — in Yahweh's hearing your murmurings, which ye are murmuring against Him, and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.'
\v 9 And Moses said unto Aaron, 'Say unto all the company of the sons of Israel, Come ye near before Yahweh, for He had heard your murmurings;'
\v 10 and it came to pass, when Aaron is speaking unto all the company of the sons of Israel, that they turn towards the wilderness, and lo, the honour of Yahweh is seen in the cloud.
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 12 I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak unto them, saying, Between the evenings ye eat flesh, and in the morning ye are satisfied with bread, and ye have known that I am Yahweh your God.'
\v 13 And it came to pass in the evening, that the quail came up, and covereth the camp, and in the morning there had been the lying of dew round about the camp,
\v 14 and the lying of the dew went up, and lo, on the face of the wilderness a thin, bare thing, thin as hoar-frost on the earth.
\v 15 And the sons of Israel see, and say one unto another, 'What is it?' for they have not known what it is; and Moses said unto them, 'It is the bread which Yahweh had given to you for food.
\v 16 This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded: Gather of it each according to his eating, an omer for a poll; and the number of your persons, take ye each for those in his tent.'
\v 17 And the sons of Israel do so, and they gather, he who is gathering much, and he who is gathering little;
\v 18 and they measure with an omer, and he who is gathering much had nothing over, and he who is gathering little had no lack, each according to his eating they have gathered.
\v 19 And Moses said unto them, 'Let no man leave of it till morning;'
\v 20 and they have not hearkened unto Moses, and some of them do leave of it till morning, and it brought up worms and stinketh; and Moses is wroth with them.
\v 21 And they gather it morning by morning, each according to his eating; when the sun had been warm, then it had melted.
\v 22 And it came to pass on the sixth day, they have gathered a second bread, two omers for one, and all the princes of the company come in, and declare to Moses.
\v 23 And he said unto them, 'It is that which Yahweh had spoken of; a rest — a holy sabbath to Yahweh — is to-morrow; that which ye bake, bake; and that which ye boil, boil; and all that is over, let rest for yourselves in charge till the morning.'
\v 24 And they let it rest until the morning, as Moses had commanded, and it had not stank, and a worm had not been in it.
\v 25 And Moses said, 'Eat it to-day, for to-day is a sabbath to Yahweh; to-day ye find it not in the field:
\v 26 six days ye do gather it, and in the seventh day — the sabbath — in it there is none.'
\v 27 And it came to pass on the seventh day, some of the people have gone out to gather, and have not found.
\v 28 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'How long have ye refused to keep My commands, and My laws?
\v 29 see, because Yahweh had given to you the sabbath, therefore He is giving to you on the sixth day bread of two days; abide ye each in his place, no one did go out from his place on the seventh day.'
\v 30 And the people rest on the seventh day,
\v 31 and the house of Israel call its name Manna, and it is as coriander seed, white; and its taste is as a cake with honey.
\v 32 And Moses said, 'This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded: Fill the omer with it, for a charge for your generations, so that they see the bread which I have caused you to eat in the wilderness, in My bringing you out from the land of Egypt.'
\v 33 And Moses said unto Aaron, 'Take one pot, and put there the fulness of the omer of manna, and let it rest before Yahweh, for a charge for your generations;'
\v 34 as Yahweh had given commandment unto Moses, so did Aaron let it rest before the Testimony, for a charge.
\v 35 And the sons of Israel have eaten the manna forty years, until their coming in unto the land to be inhabited; the manna they have eaten till their coming in unto the extremity of the land of Canaan.
\v 36 and the omer is a tenth of the ephah.
\c 17
\v 1 And all the company of the sons of Israel journey from the wilderness of Sin, on their journeyings, by the command of Yahweh, and encamp in Rephidim, and there is no water for the people to drink;
\v 2 and the people strive with Moses, and say, 'Give us water, and we drink.' And Moses said to them, 'What? — ye strive with me, what? — ye try Yahweh?'
\v 3 and the people thirst there for water, and the people murmur against Moses, and say, 'Why is this? — you hast brought us up out of Egypt, to put us to death, also our sons and our cattle, with thirst.'
\v 4 And Moses crieth to Yahweh, saying, 'What do I to this people? yet a little, and they have stoned me.'
\v 5 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Pass over before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel, and your rod with which you hast smitten the River take in your hand, and you hast gone:
\v 6 Lo, I am standing before thee there on the rock in Horeb, and you hast smitten on the rock, and waters have come out from it, and the people have drunk.' And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel,
\v 7 and he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the 'strife' of the sons of Israel, and because of their 'trying' Yahweh, saying, 'Is Yahweh in our middle or not?'
\v 8 And Amalek came, and fighteth with Israel in Rephidim,
\v 9 and Moses said unto Joshua, 'Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I am standing on the top of the hill, and the rod of God in my hand.'
\v 10 And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek, and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, have gone up to the top of the height;
\v 11 and it had come to pass, when Moses lifteth up his hand, that Israel had been mighty, and when he letteth his hands rest, that Amalek had been mighty.
\v 12 And the hands of Moses are heavy, and they take a stone, and set it under him, and he sitteth on it: and Aaron and Hur have taken hold on his hands, on this side one, and on that one, and his hands are stedfast till the going in of the sun;
\v 13 and Joshua weakeneth Amalek and his people by the mouth of the sword.
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Write this, a memorial in a Book, and set it in the ears of Joshua, that I do utterly wipe away the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens;'
\v 15 and Moses built an altar, and called its name Yahweh-Nissi,
\v 16 and said, 'Because a hand is on the throne of Jah, war is to Yahweh with Amalek from generation — generation.'
\c 18
\v 1 And Jethro priest of Midian, father-in-law of Moses, heareth all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, that Yahweh had brought out Israel from Egypt,
\v 2 and Jethro, father-in-law of Moses, taketh Zipporah, wife of Moses, besides her parents,
\v 3 and her two sons, of whom the name of the one is Gershom, for he said, 'a sojourner I have been in a strange land:'
\v 4 and the name of the other is Eliezer, for, 'the God of my father is for my help, and did deliver me from the sword of Pharaoh.'
\v 5 And Jethro, father-in-law of Moses, came, and his sons, and his wife, unto Moses, unto the wilderness where he is encamping — the mount of God;
\v 6 and he said unto Moses, 'I, your father-in-law, Jethro, am coming unto thee, and your wife, and her two sons with her.'
\v 7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and boweth himself, and kisseth him, and they ask one at another of welfare, and come into the tent;
\v 8 and Moses recounteth to his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians, on account of Israel, all the travail which had found them in the way, and Yahweh did deliver them.
\v 9 And Jethro rejoiceth for all the good which Yahweh had done to Israel, whom He had delivered from the hand of the Egyptians;
\v 10 and Jethro said, 'Blessed is Yahweh, who had delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of Pharaoh — who had delivered this people from under the hand of the Egyptians;
\v 11 now I have known that Yahweh is greater than all the gods, for in the thing they have acted proudly — He is above them!'
\v 12 And Jethro, father-in-law of Moses, taketh a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came in, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses, before God.
\v 13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sitteth to judge the people, and the people stand before Moses, from the morning unto the evening;
\v 14 and the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he is doing to the people, and said, 'What is this thing which you art doing to the people? wherefore art you sitting by yourself, and all the people standing by thee from morning till evening?'
\v 15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, 'Because the people come unto me to seek God;
\v 16 when they have a matter, it had come unto me, and I have judged between a man and his neighbour, and made known the statutes of God, and His laws.'
\v 17 And the father-in-law of Moses said unto him, 'The thing which you art doing is not good;
\v 18 you will surely wear away, both you, and this people which is with thee, for the thing is too heavy for thee, you art not able to do it by yourself.
\v 19 'Now, hearken to my voice, I counsel thee, and God is with thee: be you for the people over-against God, and you hast brought in the things unto God;
\v 20 and you hast warned them concerning the statutes and the laws, and hast made known to them the way in which they go, and the work which they do.
\v 21 And you — you will provide out of all the people men of ability, fearing God, men of truth, hating dishonest gain, and hast placed these over them, heads of yousands, heads of hundreds, heads of fifties, and heads of tens,
\v 22 and they have judged the people at all times; and it had come to pass, every great matter they bring in unto thee, and every small matter they judge themselves; and lighten it from off yourself, and they have borne with thee.
\v 23 If you will this thing, and God had commanded thee, then you hast been able to stand, and all this people also went in unto its place in peace.'
\v 24 And Moses hearkeneth to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he said,
\v 25 and Moses chooseth men of ability out of all Israel, and made them chiefs over the people, heads of yousands, heads of hundreds, heads of fifties, and heads of tens,
\v 26 and they have judged the people at all times; the hard matter they bring in unto Moses, and every small matter they judge themselves.
\v 27 And Moses sent his father-in-law away, and he went away unto his own land.
\c 19
\v 1 In the third month of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in this day they have come into the wilderness of Sinai,
\v 2 and they journey from Rephidim, and enter the wilderness of Sinai, and encamp in the wilderness; and Israel encampeth there before the mount.
\v 3 And Moses had gone up unto God, and Yahweh called unto him out of the mount, saying, 'Thus will you say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel,
\v 4 Ye — ye have seen that which I have done to the Egyptians, and I bear you on eagles' wings, and bring you in unto Myself.
\v 5 And now, if ye really hearken to My voice, then ye have kept My covenant, and been to Me a peculiar treasure more than all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;
\v 6 and ye — ye are to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation: these are the words which you will speak unto the sons of Israel.'
\v 7 And Moses came, and called for the elders of the people, and setteth before them all these words which Yahweh had commanded him;
\v 8 and all the people answer together and say, 'All that Yahweh had spoken we do;' and Moses returneth the words of the people unto Yahweh.
\v 9 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Lo, I am coming unto thee in the thickness of the cloud, so that the people hear in My speaking with thee, and also believe in thee to the age;' and Moses declareth the words of the people unto Yahweh.
\v 10 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go unto the people; and you hast sanctified them to-day and to-morrow, and they have washed their garments,
\v 11 and have been prepared for the third day; for on the third day did Yahweh come down before the eyes of all the people, on mount Sinai.
\v 12 And you hast made a border for the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, going up into the mount, or coming against its extremity; whoever is coming against the mount is certainly put to death;
\v 13 a hand came not against him, for he is certainly stoned or shot through, whether beast or man it lived not; in the drawing out of the jubilee cornet they go up into the mount.'
\v 14 And Moses came down from the mount unto the people, and sanctifieth the people, and they wash their garments;
\v 15 and he said unto the people, 'Be ye prepared for the third day, come not nigh unto a woman.'
\v 16 And it came to pass, on the third day, while it is morning, that there are voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud, on the mount, and the sound of a trumpet very strong; and all the people who are in the camp do tremble.
\v 17 And Moses brought out the people to meet God from the camp, and they station themselves at the lower part of the mount,
\v 18 and mount Sinai is wholly a smoke from the presence of Yahweh, who had come down on it in fire, and its smoke went up as smoke of the furnace, and the whole mount trembleth exceedingly;
\v 19 and the sound of the trumpet is going on, and very strong; Moses spoke, and God did answer him with a voice.
\v 20 And Yahweh came down on mount Sinai, unto the top of the mount, and Yahweh called for Moses unto the top of the mount, and Moses went up.
\v 21 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go down, protest to the people, lest they break through unto Yahweh to see, and many of them have fallen;
\v 22 and also the priests who are coming nigh unto Yahweh do sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break forth on them.'
\v 23 And Moses said unto Yahweh, 'The people is unable to come up unto mount Sinai, for Thou — Thou hast protested to us, saying, Make a border for the mount, then you hast sanctified it.'
\v 24 And Yahweh said unto him, 'Go, descend, then you hast come up, you, and Aaron with thee; and the priests and the people do not break through, to come up unto Yahweh, lest He break forth upon them.'
\v 25 And Moses went down unto the people, and said unto them: — 
\c 20
\v 1 'And God spoke all these words, saying,
\v 2 I am Yahweh your God, who had brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants.
\v 3 'Thou hast no other Gods before Me.
\v 4 Thou will not make to yourself a graven image, or any likeness which is in the heavens above, or which is in the earth beneath, or which is in the waters under the earth.
\v 5 Thou will not bow yourself to them, nor serve them: for I, Yahweh your God, am a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on the third generation, and on the fourth, of those hating Me,
\v 6 and doing kindness to yousands, of those loving Me and keeping My commands.
\v 7 'Thou will not take up the name of Yahweh your God for a vain thing, for Yahweh acquitteth not him who taketh up His name for a vain thing.
\v 8 'Remember the Sabbath-day to sanctify it;
\v 9 six days you will labour, and hast done all your work,
\v 10 and the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God; you will not do any work, you, and your son, and your daughter, your man-servant, and your handmaid, and your cattle, and your sojourner who is within your gates, — 
\v 11 for six days had Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested in the seventh day; therefore had Yahweh blessed the Sabbath-day, and did sanctify it.
\v 12 'Honour your father and your mother, so that your days are prolonged on the ground which Yahweh your God is giving to thee.
\v 13 'Thou will not murder.
\v 14 'Thou will not commit adultery.
\v 15 'Thou will not steal.
\v 16 'Thou will not answer against your neighbour a false testimony.
\v 17 Thou will not desire the house of your neighbour, you will not desire the wife of your neighbour, or his man-servant, or his handmaid, or his ox, or his ass, or anything which is your neighbour's.'
\v 18 And all the people are seeing the voices, and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking; and the people see, and move, and stand afar off,
\v 19 and say unto Moses, 'Speak you with us, and we hear, and let not God speak with us, lest we die.'
\v 20 And Moses said unto the people, 'Fear not, for to try you had God come, and in order that His fear may be before your faces — that ye sin not.'
\v 21 And the people stand afar off, and Moses had drawn nigh unto the thick darkness where God is.
\v 22 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Thus will you say unto the sons of Israel: Ye — ye have seen that from the heavens I have spoken with you;
\v 23 ye do not make with Me gods of silver, even gods of gold ye do not make to yourselves.
\v 24 'An altar of earth you will make for Me, and you hast sacrificed on it your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings, your flock and your herd; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered I come in unto thee, and have blessed thee.
\v 25 'And if an altar of stones you will make to Me, you will not build them of hewn work; when your tool you hast waved over it, then you will pollute it;
\v 26 neither will you go up by steps on Mine altar, that your nakedness be not revealed upon it.
\c 21
\v 1 And these are the judgments which you will set before them:
\v 2 When you buyest a Hebrew servant — six years he did serve, and in the seventh he went out as a freeman for nought;
\v 3 if by himself he came in, by himself he went out; if he is owner of a wife, then his wife had gone out with him;
\v 4 if his lord give to him a wife, and she had borne to him sons or daughters — the wife and her children are her lord's, and he went out by himself.
\v 5 And if the servant really say: I have loved my lord, my wife, and my sons — I do not go out free;
\v 6 then had his lord brought him nigh unto God, and had brought him nigh unto the door, or unto the side-post, and his lord had bored his ear with an awl, and he had served him — to the age.
\v 7 'And when a man selleth his daughter for a handmaid, she did not go out according to the going out of the men-servants;
\v 8 if evil in the eyes of her lord, so that he had not betrothed her, then he had let her be ransomed; to a strange people he had not power to sell her, in his dealing treacherously with her.
\v 9 'And if to his son he betroth her, according to the right of daughters he did to her.
\v 10 If another woman he take for him, her food, her covering, and her habitation, he did not withdraw;
\v 11 and if these three he do not to her, then she had gone out for nought, wiyout money.
\v 12 'He who smiteth a man so that he had died, is certainly put to death;
\v 13 as to him who had not laid wait, and God had brought to his hand, I have even set for thee a place whither he did flee.
\v 14 'And when a man did presume against his neighbour to slay him with subtilty, from Mine altar you will take him to die.
\v 15 'And he who smiteth his father or his mother is certainly put to death.
\v 16 'And he who stealeth a man, and had sold him, and he had been found in his hand, is certainly put to death.
\v 17 'And he who is reviling his father or his mother is certainly put to death.
\v 18 'And when men contend, and a man had smitten his neighbour with a stone, or with the fist, and he die not, but had fallen on the bed;
\v 19 if he rise, and had gone up and down wiyout on his staff, then had the smiter been acquitted; only his cessation he gave, and he is thoroughly healed.
\v 20 And when a man smiteth his man-servant or his handmaid, with a rod, and he had died under his hand — he is certainly avenged;
\v 21 only if he remain a day, or two days, he is not avenged, for he is his money.
\v 22 'And when men strive, and have smitten a pregnant woman, and her children have come out, and there is no mischief, he is certainly fined, as the husband of the woman did lay upon him, and he had given through the judges;
\v 23 and if there is mischief, then you hast given life for life,
\v 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\v 25 burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
\v 26 'And when a man smiteth the eye of his man-servant, or the eye of his handmaid, and had destroyed it, as a freeman he did send him away for his eye;
\v 27 and if a tooth of his man-servant or a tooth of his handmaid he knock out, as a freeman he did send him away for his tooth.
\v 28 And when an ox did gore man or woman, and they have died, the ox is certainly stoned, and his flesh is not eaten, and the owner of the ox is acquitted;
\v 29 and if the ox is one accustomed to gore heretofore, and it had been testified to its owner, and he did not watch it, and it had put to death a man or woman, the ox is stoned, and its owner also is put to death.
\v 30 'If atonement is laid upon him, then he had given the ransom of his life, according to all that is laid upon him;
\v 31 whether it gore a son or gore a daughter, according to this judgment it is done to him.
\v 32 'If the ox gore a man-servant or a handmaid, thirty silver shekels he did give to their lord, and the ox is stoned.
\v 33 And when a man did open a pit, or when a man did dig a pit, and did not cover it, and an ox or ass had fallen thither, — 
\v 34 the owner of the pit did repay, money he did give back to its owner, and the dead is his.
\v 35 'And when a man's ox did smite the ox of his neighbour, and it had died, then they have sold the living ox, and halved its money, and also the dead one they do halve;
\v 36 or, it had been known that the ox is one accustomed to gore heretofore, and its owner did not watch it, he certainly repayeth ox for ox, and the dead is his.
\c 22
\v 1 'When a man did steal an ox or sheep, and had slaughtered it or sold it, five of the herd he did repay for the ox, and four of the flock for the sheep.
\v 2 'If in the breaking through, the thief is found, and he had been smitten, and had died, there is no blood for him;
\v 3 if the sun had risen upon him, blood is for him, he did certainly repay; if he have nothing, then he had been sold for his theft;
\v 4 if the theft is certainly found in his hand alive, whether ox, or ass, or sheep — double he repayeth.
\v 5 When a man depastureth a field or vineyard, and had sent out his beast, and it had pastured in the field of another, of the best of his field, and the best of his vineyard, he did repay.
\v 6 'When fire went forth, and had found thorns, and a stack, or the standing corn, or the field, had been consumed, he who caused the burning did certainly repay.
\v 7 'When a man did give unto his neighbour silver, or vessels to keep, and it had been stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, he repayeth double.
\v 8 'If the thief is not found, then the master of the house had been brought near unto God, whether he had not put forth his hand against the work of his neighbour;
\v 9 for every matter of transgression, for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, for any lost thing of which it is said that it is his; unto God came the matter of them both; he whom God did condemn, he repayeth double to his neighbour.
\v 10 When a man did give unto his neighbour an ass, or ox, or sheep, or any beast to keep, and it had died, or had been hurt, or taken captive, none seeing — 
\v 11 an oath of Yahweh is between them both, that he had not put forth his hand against the work of his neighbour, and its owner had accepted, and he did not repay;
\v 12 but if it is certainly stolen from him, he did repay to its owner;
\v 13 if it is certainly torn, he brought it in — a witness; the torn thing he did not repay.
\v 14 And when a man did ask anything from his neighbour, and it had been hurt or had died — its owner not being with it — he did certainly repay;
\v 15 if its owner is with it, he did not repay, — if it is a hired thing, it had come for its hire.
\v 16 And when a man did entice a virgin who is not betrothed, and had lain with her, he did certainly endow her to himself for a wife;
\v 17 if her father utterly refuse to give her to him, money he did weigh out according to the dowry of virgins.
\v 18 'A witch you will not keep alive.
\v 19 'Whoever lieth with a beast is certainly put to death.
\v 20 'He who is sacrificing to a god, save to Yahweh alone, is devoted.
\v 21 'And a sojourner you will not oppress, nor crush him, for sojourners ye have been in the land of Egypt.
\v 22 'Any widow or orphan ye do not afflict;
\v 23 if you will really afflict him, surely if he at all cry unto Me, I certainly hear his cry;
\v 24 and Mine anger had burned, and I have killed you by the sword, and your wives have been widows, and your sons orphans.
\v 25 'If you will lend My poor people with thee money, you art not to him as a usurer; you will not lay on him usury;
\v 26 if you will at all take in pledge the garment of your neighbour, during the going in of the sun you will return it to him:
\v 27 for it alone is his covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein did he lie down? and it had come to pass, when he did cry unto Me, that I have heard, for I am gracious.
\v 28 'God you will not revile, and a prince among your people you will not curse.
\v 29 'Your fulness and your liquids you will not delay; the first-born of your sons you will give to Me;
\v 30 so you will to yours ox, to your sheep; seven days it is with its dam, on the eighth day you will give it to Me.
\v 31 'And ye are holy men to Me, and flesh torn in the field ye do not eat, to a dog ye do cast it.
\c 23
\v 1 'Thou will not lift up a vain report; you will not put your hand with a wicked man to be a violent witness.
\v 2 Thou art not after many to evil, nor will you testify concerning a strife, to turn aside after many to cause others to turn aside;
\v 3 and a poor man you will not honour in his strife.
\v 4 'When you meetest yours enemy's ox or his ass going astray, you will certainly turn it back to him;
\v 5 when you seest the ass of him who is hating thee crouching under its burden, then you hast ceased from leaving it to it — you will certainly leave it with him.
\v 6 'Thou will not turn aside the judgment of your needy one in his strife;
\v 7 from a false matter you will keep far off, and an innocent and righteous man you will not slay; for I do not justify a wicked man.
\v 8 And a bribe you will not take; for the bribe bindeth the open -eyed, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
\v 9 And a sojourner you will not oppress, and ye — ye have known the soul of the sojourner, for sojourners ye have been in the land of Egypt.
\v 10 'And six years you will sow your land, and hast gathered its increase;
\v 11 and the seventh you will release it, and hast left it, and the needy of your people have eaten, and their leaving did the beast of the field eat; so will you to your vineyard — to yours olive-yard.
\v 12 'Six days you will do your work, and on the seventh day you will rest, so that yours ox and yours ass did rest, and the son of yours handmaid and the sojourner is refreshed;
\v 13 and in all that which I have said unto you ye do take heed; and the name of other gods ye do not mention; it is not heard on your mouth.
\v 14 'Three times you will keep a feast to Me in a year;
\v 15 the Feast of Unleavened things you will keep; seven days you will eat unleavened things, as I have commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month of Abib; for in it you hast come forth out of Egypt, and ye do not appear in My presence empty;
\v 16 and the Feast of Harvest, the first fruits of your works which you sowest in the field; and the Feast of the In-Gathering, in the outgoing of the year, in your gathering your works out of the field.
\v 17 'Three times in a year do all your males appear before the face of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 18 'Thou will not sacrifice on a fermented thing the blood of My sacrifice, and the fat of My festival did not remain till morning;
\v 19 the beginning of the first-fruits of your ground you will bring into the house of Yahweh your God; you will not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
\v 20 'Lo, I am sending a messenger before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee in unto the place which I have prepared;
\v 21 be watchful because of his presence, and hearken to his voice, rebel not against him, for he beareth not with your transgression, for My name is in his heart;
\v 22 for, if you diligently hearken to his voice, and hast done all that which I speak, then I have been at enmity with yours enemies, and have distressed those distressing thee.
\v 23 'For My messenger went before thee, and had brought thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I have cut them off.
\v 24 'Thou will not bow yourself to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their doings, but will utterly devote them, and thoroughly break their standing pillars.
\v 25 'And ye have served Yahweh your God, and He had blessed your bread and your water, and I have turned aside sickness from yours heart;
\v 26 there is not a miscarrying and barren one in your land; the number of your days I fulfil:
\v 27 My terror I send before thee, and I have put to death all the people among whom you comest, and I have given the neck of all yours enemies unto thee.
\v 28 'And I have sent the hornet before thee, and it had cast out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee;
\v 29 I cast them not out from before thee in one year, lest the land be a desolation, and the beast of the field had multiplied against thee;
\v 30 little by little I cast them out from before thee, till you art fruitful, and hast inherited the land.
\v 31 'And I have set your border from the Red Sea, even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I give into your hand the inhabitants of the land, and you hast cast them out from before thee;
\v 32 you will not make a covenant with them, and with their gods;
\v 33 they do not dwell in your land, lest they cause thee to sin against Me when you servest their gods, when it became a snare to thee.'
\c 24
\v 1 And unto Moses He said, 'Come up unto Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and ye have bowed yourselves afar off;'
\v 2 and Moses had drawn nigh by himself unto Yahweh; and they draw not nigh, and the people go not up with him.
\v 3 And Moses came in, and recounteth to the people all the words of Yahweh, and all the judgments, and all the people answer — one voice, and say, 'All the words which Yahweh had spoken we do.'
\v 4 And Moses writeth all the words of Yahweh, and riseth early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve standing pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel;
\v 5 and he sent the youths of the sons of Israel, and they cause burnt-offerings to ascend, and sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings to Yahweh — calves.
\v 6 And Moses taketh half of the blood, and putteth in basins, and half of the blood had he sprinkled on the altar;
\v 7 and he taketh the Book of the Covenant, and proclaimeth in the ears of the people, and they say, 'All that which Yahweh had spoken we do, and obey.'
\v 8 And Moses taketh the blood, and sprinkleth on the people, and said, 'Lo, the blood of the covenant which Yahweh had made with you, concerning all these things.'
\v 9 And Moses went up, Aaron also, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
\v 10 and they see the God of Israel, and under His feet is as the white work of the sapphire, and as the substance of the heavens for purity;
\v 11 and unto those of the sons of Israel who are near He had not put forth His hand, and they see God, and eat and drink.
\v 12 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Come up unto Me to the mount, and be there, and I give to thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the command, which I have written to direct them.'
\v 13 And Moses riseth — Joshua his minister also — and Moses went up unto the mount of God;
\v 14 and unto the elders he had said, 'Abide ye for us in this place, until that we turn back unto you, and lo, Aaron and Hur are with you — he who had matters did come nigh unto them.'
\v 15 And Moses went up unto the mount, and the cloud covereth the mount;
\v 16 and the honour of Yahweh did tabernacle on mount Sinai, and the cloud covereth it six days, and He called unto Moses on the seventh day from the middle of the cloud.
\v 17 And the appearance of the honour of Yahweh is as a consuming fire on the top of the mount, before the eyes of the sons of Israel;
\v 18 and Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and went up unto the mount, and Moses is on the mount forty days and forty nights.
\c 25
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they take for Me a heave-offering; from every man whose heart impelleth him ye do take My heave-offering.
\v 3 And this is the heave-offering which ye take from them; gold, and silver, and brass,
\v 4 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' hair,
\v 5 and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
\v 6 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the perfume of the spices,
\v 7 shoham stones, and stones for setting for an ephod, and for a breastplate.
\v 8 'And they have made for Me a sanctuary, and I have tabernacled in their middle;
\v 9 according to all that which I am shewing thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its vessels, even so ye do make it.
\v 10 'And they have made an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;
\v 11 and you hast overlaid it with pure gold, within and wiyout you will overlay it, and you hast made on it a ring of gold round about.
\v 12 And you hast cast for it four rings of gold, and hast put them on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;
\v 13 and you hast made staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold,
\v 14 and hast brought the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark by them,
\v 15 in the rings of the ark are the staves, they are not turned aside from it;
\v 16 and you hast put unto the ark the testimony which I give unto thee.
\v 17 'And you hast made a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;
\v 18 and you hast made two cherubs of gold, beaten work will you make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;
\v 19 and make you one cherub at the end on this side, and one cherub at the end on that; at the mercy-seat ye do make the cherubs on its two ends.
\v 20 And the cherubs have been spreading out wings on high, covering the mercy-seat over with their wings, and their faces are one towards another — towards the mercy-seat are the faces of the cherubs.
\v 21 'And you hast put the mercy-seat on the ark above, and unto the ark you will put the testimony which I give unto thee;
\v 22 and I have met with thee there, and have spoken with thee from off the mercy-seat (from between the two cherubs, which are on the ark of the testimony) all that which I command thee concerning the sons of Israel.
\v 23 'And you hast made a table of shittim wood, two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,
\v 24 and hast overlaid it with pure gold, and hast made for it a crown of gold round about,
\v 25 and hast made for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and hast made a crown of gold to its border round about.
\v 26 And you hast made to it four rings of gold, and hast put the rings on the four corners, which are to its four feet;
\v 27 over-against the border are the rings for places for staves to bear the table;
\v 28 and you hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold, and the table had been borne with them;
\v 29 and you hast made its dishes, and its bowls, and its covers, and its cups, with which they pour out; of pure gold you will make them;
\v 30 and you hast put on the table bread of the presence before Me continually.
\v 31 'And you hast made a candlestick of pure gold, of beaten work is the candlestick made; its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers are of the same;
\v 32 and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the second side;
\v 33 three calyxes made like almonds in the one branch, a knop and a flower, and three calyxes made like almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches which are coming out from the candlestick.
\v 34 And in the candlestick are four calyxes made like almonds, its knops and its flowers;
\v 35 and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, are to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick;
\v 36 their knops and their branches are of the same, all of it one beaten work of pure gold;
\v 37 and you hast made its seven lamps, and one had caused its lights to go up, and it had given light over-against its front.
\v 38 And its snuffers and its snuff dishes are of pure gold;
\v 39 of a talent of pure gold he did make it, with all these vessels.
\v 40 And see you and do them by their pattern which you art shewn in the mount.
\c 26
\v 1 And you will make the tabernacle: ten curtains of twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet; with cherubs, work of a designer, you will make them;
\v 2 the length of the one curtain is eight and twenty by the cubit, and the breadth of the one curtain four by the cubit, one measure is to all the curtains;
\v 3 five of the curtains are joining one unto another, and five curtains are joining one to another.
\v 4 'And you hast made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain, at the end in the joining; and so you makest in the edge of the outermost curtain, in the joining of the second.
\v 5 fifty loops you will make in the one curtain, and fifty loops you will make in the edge of the curtain which is in the joining of the second, causing the loops to take hold one unto another;
\v 6 and you hast made fifty hooks of gold, and hast joined the curtains one to another by the hooks, and the tabernacle had been one.
\v 7 And you hast made curtains of goats' hair, for a tent over the tabernacle; you will make eleven curtains:
\v 8 the length of the one curtain is thirty by the cubit, and the breadth of the one curtain four by the cubit; one measure is to the eleven curtains;
\v 9 and you hast joined the five curtains apart, and the six curtains apart, and hast doubled the six curtains over-against the front of the tent.
\v 10 'And you hast made fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain, the outermost in the joining, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which is joining the second;
\v 11 and you hast made fifty hooks of brass, and hast brought in the hooks into the loops, and hast joined the tent, and it had been one.
\v 12 And the superfluity in the curtains of the tent — the half of the curtain which is superfluous — had spread over the hinder part of the tabernacle;
\v 13 and the cubit on this side, and the cubit on that, in the superfluity in the length of the curtains of the tent, is spread out over the sides of the tabernacle, on this and on that, to cover it;
\v 14 and you hast made a covering for the tent, of rams' skins made red, and a covering of badgers' skins above.
\v 15 'And you hast made the boards for the tabernacle, of shittim wood, standing up;
\v 16 ten cubits is the length of the board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of the one board;
\v 17 two handles are to the one board, joined one unto another; so you will make for all the boards of the tabernacle;
\v 18 and you hast made the boards of the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward;
\v 19 and forty sockets of silver you will make under the twenty boards, two sockets under the one board for its two handles, and two sockets under the other board for its two handles.
\v 20 And for the second side of the tabernacle, for the north side, are twenty boards,
\v 21 and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under another board.
\v 22 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward, you will make six boards.
\v 23 And two boards you will make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
\v 24 And they are pairs beneath, and together they are pairs above its head unto the one ring; so is it for them both, they are for the two corners.
\v 25 And they have been eight boards, and their sockets of silver are sixteen sockets, two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under another board.
\v 26 'And you hast made bars of shittim wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
\v 27 and five bars for the boards of the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle at the two sides, westward;
\v 28 and one had caused the middle bar in the middle of the boards to reach from end unto end;
\v 29 and the boards you will overlay with gold, and their rings you will make of gold places for bars, and hast overlaid their bars with gold;
\v 30 and you hast raised up the tabernacle according to its fashion which you hast been shewn in the mount.
\v 31 And you hast made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of a designer; he made it with cherubs;
\v 32 and you hast put it on four pillars of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, their pegs are of gold, on four sockets of silver.
\v 33 'And you hast put the vail under the hooks, and hast brought in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony; and the vail had made a separation for you between the holy and the holy of holies.
\v 34 'And you hast put the mercy-seat on the ark of the testimony, in the holy of holies.
\v 35 'And you hast set the table at the outside of the vail, and the candlestick over-against the table on the side of the tabernacle southward, and the table you will put on the north side.
\v 36 'And you hast made a covering for the opening of the tent, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of an embroiderer;
\v 37 and you hast made for the covering five pillars of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold, their pegs are of gold, and you hast cast for them five sockets of brass.
\c 27
\v 1 And you hast made the altar of shittim wood, five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth — the altar is square — and three cubits its height.
\v 2 And you hast made its horns on its four corners, its horns are of the same, and you hast overlaid it with brass.
\v 3 And you hast made its pots to remove its ashes, and its shovels, and its bowls, and its forks, and its fire-pans, even all its vessels you will make of brass.
\v 4 'And you hast made for it a grate of net-work of brass, and hast made on the net four rings of brass on its four extremities,
\v 5 and hast put it under the compass of the altar beneath, and the net had been unto the middle of the altar.
\v 6 And you hast made staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with brass.
\v 7 And the staves have been brought into the rings, and the staves have been on the two sides of the altar in bearing it.
\v 8 Hollow with boards you will make it, as it had been shewed thee in the mount, so do they make it.
\v 9 And you hast made the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward, hangings for the court of twined linen, a hundred by the cubit is the length for the one side,
\v 10 and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets are of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are of silver;
\v 11 and so for the north side in length, hangings of a hundred cubits in length, and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets are of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are of silver.
\v 12 And for the breadth of the court at the west side are hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.
\v 13 And for the breadth of the court at the east side, eastward, are fifty cubits.
\v 14 And the hangings at the side are fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.
\v 15 And at the second side are hangings fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.
\v 16 'And for the gate of the court a covering of twenty cubits, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of an embroiderer; their pillars four, their sockets four.
\v 17 All the pillars of the court round about are filleted with silver, their pegs are silver, and their sockets brass.
\v 18 The length of the court is a hundred by the cubit, and the breadth fifty by fifty, and the height five cubits, of twined linen, and their sockets are brass,
\v 19 even all the vessels of the tabernacle, in all its service, and all its pins, and all the pins of the court, are brass.
\v 20 And you — you will command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure beaten olive oil for the light, to cause the lamp to go up continually;
\v 21 in the tent of meeting, at the outside of the vail, which is over the testimony, did Aaron — his sons also — arrange it from evening till morning before Yahweh — a statute age-during to their generations, from the sons of Israel.
\c 28
\v 1 And you, bring you near unto thee Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from the middle of the sons of Israel, for his being priest to Me, even Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, sons of Aaron;
\v 2 and you hast made holy garments for Aaron your brother, for honour and for beauty;
\v 3 and you — you will speak unto all the wise of heart, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, and they have made the garments of Aaron to sanctify him for his being priest to Me.
\v 4 And these are the garments which they make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and an upper robe, and an embroidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle; yea, they have made holy garments for Aaron your brother, and for his sons, for his being priest to Me.
\v 5 'And they take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the linen,
\v 6 and have made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of a designer;
\v 7 it had two shoulders joining at its two ends, and it is joined.
\v 8 And the girdle of his ephod which is on him, according to its work, is of the same, of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
\v 9 'And you hast taken the two shoham stones, and hast opened on them the names of the sons of Israel;
\v 10 six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the second stone, according to their births;
\v 11 the work of an engraver in stone, openings of a signet, you will open the two stones by the names of the sons of Israel; turned round, embroidered with gold, you will make them.
\v 12 And you hast set the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod — stones of memorial to the sons of Israel — and Aaron had borne their names before Yahweh, on his two shoulders, for a memorial.
\v 13 'And you hast made embroidered things of gold,
\v 14 and two chains of pure gold, wreathed work you will make them, work of thick bands, and you hast put the thick chains on the embroidered things.
\v 15 'And you hast made a breastplate of judgment, work of a designer; according to the work of the ephod you will make it; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen you will make it;
\v 16 it is square, doubled, a span its length, and a span its breadth.
\v 17 And you hast set in it settings of stone, four rows of stone; a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle is the first row;
\v 18 and the second row is emerald, sapphire, and diamond;
\v 19 and the third row is opal, agate, and ameyourst;
\v 20 and the fourth row is beryl, and onyx, and jasper; embroidered with gold are they in their settings,
\v 21 and the stones are according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names, openings of a signet, each by his name are they for the twelve tribes.
\v 22 'And you hast made on the breastplate wreathed chains, work of thick bands, of pure gold;
\v 23 and you hast made on the breastplate two rings of gold, and hast put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate;
\v 24 and you hast put the two thick bands of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate;
\v 25 and the two ends of the two thick bands you will put on the two embroidered things, and you hast put them on the shoulders of the ephod over-against its face.
\v 26 And you hast made two rings of gold, and hast set them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its border, which is over-against the ephod within;
\v 27 and you hast made two rings of gold, and hast put them on the two shoulders of the ephod, beneath, over-against its front, over-against its joining, above the girdle of the ephod,
\v 28 and they bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue, to be above the girdle of the ephod, and the breastplate is not loosed from the ephod.
\v 29 'And Aaron had borne the names of the sons of Israel in the breastplate of judgment, on his heart, in his going in unto the sanctuary, for a memorial before Yahweh continually.
\v 30 'And you hast put unto the breastplate of judgment the Lights and the Perfections, and they have been on the heart of Aaron, in his going in before Yahweh, and Aaron had borne the judgment of the sons of Israel on his heart before Yahweh continually.
\v 31 'And you hast made the upper robe of the ephod completely of blue,
\v 32 and the opening for its head had been in its middle, a border is to its opening round about, work of a weaver, as the opening of a habergeon there is to it; it is not rent.
\v 33 'And you hast made on its hem pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, on its hem round about, and bells of gold in their middle round about;
\v 34 a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate are on the hems of the upper robe round about.
\v 35 'And it had been on Aaron to minister in, and its sound had been heard in his coming in unto the sanctuary before Yahweh, and in his going out, and he did not die.
\v 36 And you hast made a flower of pure gold, and hast opened on it — openings of a signet — 'Holy to Yahweh;'
\v 37 and you hast put it on a blue ribbon, and it had been on the mitre — over-against the front of the mitre it is;
\v 38 and it had been on the forehead of Aaron, and Aaron had borne the iniquity of the holy things which the sons of Israel do hallow, even all their holy gifts; and it had been on his forehead continually for a pleasing thing for them before Yahweh.
\v 39 And you hast embroidered the coat of linen, and hast made a mitre of linen, and a girdle you will make — work of an embroiderer.
\v 40 'And for the sons of Aaron you will make coats, and you hast made for them girdles, yea, bonnets you will make for them, for honour and for beauty;
\v 41 and you hast clothed Aaron your brother with them, and his sons with him, and hast anointed them, and hast consecrated their hand, and hast sanctified them, and they have been priests to Me.
\v 42 'And make you for them linen trousers to cover the naked flesh: they are from the loins even unto the thighs;
\v 43 and they have been on Aaron and on his sons, in their going in unto the tent of meeting, or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister in the sanctuary, and they do not bear iniquity nor have they died; a statute age-during to him, and to his seed after him.
\c 29
\v 1 And this is the thing which you will to them, to hallow them, for being priests to Me: Take one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams, perfect ones,
\v 2 and bread unleavened, and cakes unleavened anointed with oil, of fine wheaten flour you will make them,
\v 3 and you hast put them on one basket, and hast brought them near in the basket, also the bullock and the two rams.
\v 4 'And Aaron and his sons you will bring near unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and hast bathed them with water;
\v 5 and you hast taken the garments, and hast clothed Aaron with the coat, and the upper robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and hast girded him with the girdle of the ephod,
\v 6 and hast set the mitre on his head, and hast put the holy crown on the mitre,
\v 7 and hast taken the anointing oil, and hast poured it on his head, and hast anointed him.
\v 8 And his sons you will bring near, and hast clothed them with coats,
\v 9 and hast girded them with a girdle (Aaron and his sons), and hast bound on them bonnets; and the priesthood had been theirs by a statute age-during, and you hast consecrated the hand of Aaron, and the hand of his sons,
\v 10 and hast brought near the bullock before the tent of meeting, and Aaron had laid — his sons also — their hands on the head of the bullock.
\v 11 'And you hast slaughtered the bullock before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 12 and hast taken of the blood of the bullock, and hast put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and all the blood you will pour out at the foundation of the altar;
\v 13 and you hast taken all the fat which is covering the inwards, and the redundance on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, and hast made perfume on the altar;
\v 14 and the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, you will burn with fire at the outside of the camp; it is a sin-offering.
\v 15 'And the one ram you will take, and Aaron and his sons have laid their hands on the head of the ram,
\v 16 and you hast slaughtered the ram, and hast taken its blood, and hast sprinkled it on the altar round about,
\v 17 and the ram you will cut into its pieces, and hast washed its inwards, and its legs, and hast put them on its pieces, and on its head;
\v 18 and you hast made perfume with the whole ram on the altar. It is a burnt-offering to Yahweh, a sweet fragrance; a fire-offering it is to Yahweh.
\v 19 And you hast taken the second ram, and Aaron had laid — his sons also — their hands on the head of the ram,
\v 20 and you hast slaughtered the ram, and hast taken of its blood, and hast put on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and hast sprinkled the blood on the altar round about;
\v 21 and you hast taken of the blood which is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and hast sprinkled on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him, and he had been hallowed, he, and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
\v 22 And you hast taken from the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat which is covering the inwards, and the redundance on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, and the right leg, for it is a ram of consecration,
\v 23 and one round cake of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one thin cake out of the basket of the unleavened things which is before Yahweh.
\v 24 And you hast set the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and hast waved them — a wave-offering before Yahweh;
\v 25 and you hast taken them out of their hand, and hast made perfume on the altar beside the burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance before Yahweh; a fire-offering it is to Yahweh.
\v 26 And you hast taken the breast from the ram of the consecration which is for Aaron, and hast waved it — a wave-offering before Yahweh, and it had become your portion;
\v 27 and you hast sanctified the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, which had been waved, and which had been lifted up from the ram of the consecration, of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons;
\v 28 and it had been for Aaron and for his sons, by a statute age-during from the sons of Israel, for it is a heave-offering; and it is a heave offering from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings — their heave-offering to Yahweh.
\v 29 'And the holy garments which are Aaron's, are for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to consecrate in them their hand;
\v 30 seven days did the priest in his stead (of his sons) put them on, when he went in unto the tent of meeting, to minister in the sanctuary.
\v 31 'And the ram of the consecration you will take, and hast boiled its flesh in the holy place;
\v 32 and Aaron had eaten — his sons also — the flesh of the ram, and the bread which is in the basket, at the opening of the tent of meeting;
\v 33 and they have eaten those things by which there is atonement to consecrate their hand, to sanctify them; and a stranger did not eat — for they are holy;
\v 34 and if there be left of the flesh of the consecration or of the bread till the morning, then you hast burned that which is left with fire; it is not eaten, for it is holy.
\v 35 'And you hast done thus to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days you will consecrate their hand;
\v 36 and a bullock, a sin-offering, you will prepare daily for the atonements, and you hast atoned for the altar, in your making atonement on it, and hast anointed it to sanctify it;
\v 37 seven days you will make atonement for the altar, and hast sanctified it, and the altar had been most holy; all that is coming against the altar is holy.
\v 38 And this is that which you will prepare on the altar; two lambs, sons of a year, daily continually;
\v 39 the one lamb you will prepare in the morning, and the second lamb you will prepare between the evenings;
\v 40 and a tenth deal of fine flour, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin, and a libation, a fourth part of a hin, of wine, is for the one lamb.
\v 41 And the second lamb you will prepare between the evenings; according to the present of the morning, and according to its libation, you will prepare for it, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering, to Yahweh: — 
\v 42 a continual burnt-offering for your generations, at the opening of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh, whither I am met with you, to speak unto thee there,
\v 43 and I have met there with the sons of Israel, and it had been sanctified by My honour.
\v 44 'And I have sanctified the tent of meeting, and the altar, and Aaron and his sons I sanctify for being priests to Me,
\v 45 and I have tabernacled in the middle of the sons of Israel, and have become their God,
\v 46 and they have known that I am Yahweh their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I may tabernacle in their middle; I am Yahweh their God.
\c 30
\v 1 And you hast made an altar for making perfume; of shittim wood you will make it;
\v 2 a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is square), and two cubits its height; its horns are of the same.
\v 3 'And you hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and you hast made to it a crown of gold round about;
\v 4 and two rings of gold you will make to it under its crown; on its two ribs you will make them, on its two sides, and they have become places for staves, to bear it with them.
\v 5 'And you hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold;
\v 6 and you hast put it before the vail, which is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which is over the testimony, whither I am met with thee.
\v 7 'And Aaron had made perfume on it, perfume of spices, morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he did perfume it,
\v 8 and in Aaron's causing the lamps to go up between the evenings, he did perfume it; a continual perfume before Yahweh to your generations.
\v 9 'Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on it;
\v 10 and Aaron had made atonement on its horns, once in a year, by the blood of the sin-offering of atonements; once in a year did he make atonement for it, to your generations; it is most holy to Yahweh.'
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 12 When you takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for their numbers, then they have given each an atonement for his soul to Yahweh in their being numbered, and there is no plague among them in their being numbered.
\v 13 This they do give, every one passing over unto those numbered, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs); half a shekel is the heave-offering to Yahweh;
\v 14 every one passing over unto those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upwards, did give the heave-offering of Yahweh;
\v 15 the rich did not multiply, and the poor did not diminish from the half-shekel, to give the heave-offering of Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.
\v 16 'And you hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of Israel, and hast given it for the service of the tent of meeting; and it had been to the sons of Israel for a memorial before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.'
\v 17 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 18 'And you hast made a laver of brass (and its base of brass), for washing; and you hast put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there;
\v 19 and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and their feet,
\v 20 in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash with water, and die not; or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister, to perfume a fire-offering to Yahweh,
\v 21 then they have washed their hands and their feet, and they die not, and it had been to them a statute age-during, to him and to his seed to their generations.'
\v 22 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 23 And you, take to yourself principal spices, wild honey five hundred shekels; and spice-cinnamon, the half of that, two hundred and fifty; and spice-cane two hundred and fifty;
\v 24 and cassia five hundred, by the shekel of the sanctuary, and olive oil a hin;
\v 25 and you hast made it a holy anointing oil, a compound mixture, work of a compounder; it is a holy anointing oil.
\v 26 'And you hast anointed with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,
\v 27 and the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of perfume,
\v 28 and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base;
\v 29 and you hast sanctified them, and they have been most holy; all that is coming against them is holy;
\v 30 and Aaron and his sons you will anoint, and hast sanctified them for being priests to Me.
\v 31 'And unto the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, A holy anointing oil is this to Me, to your generations;
\v 32 on flesh of man it is not poured, and with its proper proportion ye make none like it; it is holy; it is holy to you;
\v 33 a man who compoundeth any like it, or who putteth of it on a stranger — had even been cut off from his people.'
\v 34 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Take to thee spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense; they are part for part;
\v 35 and you hast made it a perfume, a compound, work of a compounder, salted, pure, holy;
\v 36 and you hast beaten some of it small, and hast put of it before the testimony, in the tent of meeting, whither I am met with thee; most holy it is to you.
\v 37 'As to the perfume which you makest, with its proper proportion ye do not make to yourselves, holy it is to thee to Yahweh;
\v 38 a man who made any like it — to be refreshed by it — had even been cut off from his people.'
\c 31
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'See, I have called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
\v 3 and I fill him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,
\v 4 to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\v 5 and in graving of stone for settings, and in graving of wood to work in all work.
\v 6 'And I, lo, I have given with him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of every wise-hearted one I have given wisdom, and they have made all that which I have commanded thee.
\v 7 The tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy-seat which is on it, and all the vessels of the tent,
\v 8 and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick and all its vessels, and the altar of the perfume,
\v 9 and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base,
\v 10 and the coloured garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for acting as priests in;
\v 11 and the anointing oil, and the perfume of the spices for the sanctuary; according to all that I have commanded thee — they do.'
\v 12 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 13 And you, speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Only, My sabbaths ye do keep, for it is a sign between Me and you, to your generations, to know that I, Yahweh, am sanctifying you;
\v 14 and ye have kept the sabbath, for it is holy to you, he who is polluting it is certainly put to death — for any who doeth work in it — that person had even been cut off from the middle of his people.
\v 15 Six days is work done, and in the seventh day is a sabbath of holy rest to Yahweh; any who doeth work in the sabbath-day is certainly put to death,
\v 16 and the sons of Israel have observed the sabbath; to keep the sabbath to their generations is a covenant age-during,
\v 17 between Me and the sons of Israel it is a sign — to the age; for six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day He had ceased, and is refreshed.'
\v 18 And He gave unto Moses, when He finisheth speaking with him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written by the finger of God.
\c 32
\v 1 And the people see that Moses is delaying to come down from the mount, and the people assemble against Aaron, and say unto him, 'Rise, make for us gods who go before us, for this Moses — the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt — we have not known what had happened to him.'
\v 2 And Aaron said unto them, 'Break off the rings of gold which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring in unto me;'
\v 3 and all the people themselves break off the rings of gold which are in their ears, and bring in unto Aaron,
\v 4 and he receiveth from their hand, and did fashion it with a graving tool, and did make it a molten calf, and they say, 'These your gods, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'
\v 5 And Aaron saw, and built an altar before it, and Aaron called, and said, 'A festival to Yahweh — to-morrow;'
\v 6 and they rise early on the morrow, and cause burnt-offerings to ascend, and bring nigh peace-offerings; and the people sit down to eat and to drink, and rise up to play.
\v 7 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go, descend, for your people whom you hast brought up out of the land of Egypt had done corruptly,
\v 8 they have turned aside hastily from the way that I have commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and bow themselves to it, and sacrifice to it, and say, These your gods, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'
\v 9 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'I have seen this people, and lo, it is a stiff-necked people;
\v 10 and now, let Me alone, and My anger did burn against them, and I consume them, and I make thee become a great nation.'
\v 11 And Moses appeaseth the face of Yahweh his God, and said, 'Why, O Yahweh, did Thine anger burn against Your people, whom Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?
\v 12 why do the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil He brought them out to slay them among mountains, and to consume them from off the face of the ground? turn back from the heat of Thine anger, and repent of the evil against Your people.
\v 13 'Be mindful of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, Your servants, to whom Thou hast sworn by Yourself, and unto whom Thou speakest: I multiply your seed as stars of the heavens, and all this land, as I have said, I give to your seed, and they have inherited to the age;'
\v 14 and Yahweh repenteth of the evil which He had spoken of doing to His people.
\v 15 And Moses turneth, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony are in his hand, tables written on both their sides, on this and on that are they written;
\v 16 and the tables are the work of God, and the writing is the writing of God, graven on the tables.
\v 17 And Joshua heareth the voice of the people in their shouting, and said unto Moses, 'A noise of battle in the camp!'
\v 18 and he said, 'It is not the voice of the crying of might, nor is it the voice of the crying of weakness — a voice of singing I am hearing.'
\v 19 And it came to pass, when he had drawn near unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing, and the anger of Moses burneth, and he threw out of his hands the tables, and breaketh them under the mount;
\v 20 and he taketh the calf which they have made, and burneth it with fire, and grindeth until it is small, and scattereth on the face of the waters, and caused the sons of Israel to drink.
\v 21 And Moses said unto Aaron, 'What had this people done to thee, that you hast brought in upon it a great sin?'
\v 22 and Aaron said, 'Let not the anger of my lord burn; you — you hast known the people that it is in evil;
\v 23 and they say to me, Make for us gods, who go before us, for this Moses — the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt — we have not known what had happened to him;
\v 24 and I say to them, Whoso had gold, let them break it off, and they give to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.'
\v 25 And Moses saw the people that it is unbridled, for Aaron had made it unbridled for contempt among its withstanders,
\v 26 and Moses standeth in the gate of the camp, and said, 'Who is for Yahweh? — unto me!' and all the sons of Levi are gathered unto him;
\v 27 and he said to them, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Put each his sword by his thigh, pass over and turn back from gate to gate through the camp, and slay each his brother, and each his friend, and each his relation.'
\v 28 And the sons of Levi do according to the word of Moses, and there fall of the people on that day about three yousand men,
\v 29 and Moses said, 'Consecrate your hand to-day to Yahweh, for a man is against his son, and against his brother, so as to bring on you to-day a blessing.'
\v 30 And it came to pass, on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, 'Ye — ye have sinned a great sin, and now I go up unto Yahweh, if so be I atone for your sin.'
\v 31 And Moses turneth back unto Yahweh, and said, 'Oh this people had sinned a great sin, that they make to themselves a god of gold;
\v 32 and now, if Thou takest away their sin — and if not — blot me, I pray thee, out of Your book which Thou hast written.'
\v 33 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Whoso had sinned against Me — I blot him out of My book;
\v 34 and now, go, lead the people whithersoever I have spoken to thee of; lo, My messenger went before thee, and in the day of my charging — then I have charged upon them their sin.'
\v 35 And Yahweh plagueth the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.
\c 33
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, 'Go, ascend from this place, you and the people, whom you hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I give it,'
\v 2 (and I have sent before thee a messenger, and have cast out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,)
\v 3 unto a land flowing with milk and honey, for I do not go up in your middle, for you art a stiff-necked people — lest I consume thee in the way.'
\v 4 And the people hear this sad thing, and mourn; and none put his ornaments on him.
\v 5 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Say unto the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people; one moment — I come up into your middle, and have consumed thee; and now, put down yours ornaments from off thee, and I know what I do to thee;'
\v 6 and the sons of Israel take off their ornaments at mount Horeb.
\v 7 And Moses taketh the tent, and had stretched it out at the outside of the camp, afar off from the camp, and had called it, 'Tent of Meeting;' and it had come to pass, every one seeking Yahweh went out unto the tent of meeting, which is at the outside of the camp.
\v 8 And it had come to pass, at the going out of Moses unto the tent, all the people rise, and have stood, each at the opening of his tent, and have looked expectingly after Moses, until his going into the tent.
\v 9 And it had come to pass, at the going in of Moses to the tent, the pillar of the cloud came down, and had stood at the opening of the tent, and He had spoken with Moses;
\v 10 and all the people have seen the pillar of the cloud standing at the opening of the tent, and all the people have risen and bowed themselves, each at the opening of his tent.
\v 11 And Yahweh had spoken unto Moses face unto face, as a man spoke unto his friend; and he had turned back unto the camp, and his minister Joshua, son of Nun, a youth, departeth not out of the tent.
\v 12 And Moses said unto Yahweh, 'See, Thou art saying unto me, Bring up this people, and Thou hast not caused me to know whom Thou will send with me; and Thou hast said, I have known thee by name, and also you hast found grace in Mine eyes.
\v 13 And now, if, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, cause me to know, I pray Thee, Your way, and I know Thee, so that I find grace in Thine eyes, and consider that this nation is Your people;'
\v 14 and He said, 'My presence did go, and I have given rest to thee.'
\v 15 And he said unto Him, 'If Your presence is not going — take us not up from this place;
\v 16 and in what is it known now, that I have found grace in Thine eyes — I and Your people — is it not in Your going with us? and we have been distinguished — I and Your people — from all the people who are on the face of the ground.'
\v 17 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Even this thing which you hast spoken I do; for you hast found grace in Mine eyes, and I know thee by name.'
\v 18 And he said, 'Shew me, I pray Thee, Thine honour;'
\v 19 and He said, 'I cause all My goodness to pass before your face, and have called concerning the Name of Yahweh before thee, and favoured him whom I favour, and loved him whom I love.'
\v 20 He said also, 'Thou art unable to see My face, for man did not see Me, and live;'
\v 21 Yahweh also said, 'Lo, a place is by Me, and you hast stood on the rock,
\v 22 and it had come to pass, in the passing by of Mine honour, that I have set thee in a cleft of the rock, and spread out My hands over thee, until My passing by,
\v 23 and I have turned aside My hands, and you hast seen My back parts, and My face is not seen.'
\c 34
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Hew for yourself two tables of stone like the first, and I have written on the tables the words which were on the first tables which you hast broken;
\v 2 and be prepared at morning, and you hast come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and hast stood before Me there, on the top of the mount,
\v 3 and no man came up with thee, and also no man is seen in all the mount, also the flock and the herd do not feed over-against that mount.'
\v 4 And he heweth two tables of stone like the first, and Moses riseth early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Yahweh commanded him, and he taketh in his hand two tables of stone.
\v 5 And Yahweh came down in a cloud, and stationeth Himself with him there, and called in the Name of Yahweh,
\v 6 and Yahweh passeth over before his face, and called: 'Yahweh, Yahweh God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth,
\v 7 keeping kindness for yousands, taking away iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on children, and on children's children, on a third generation, and on a fourth.'
\v 8 And Moses hasteth, and boweth to the earth, and did obeisance,
\v 9 and said, 'If, I pray Thee, I have found grace in Thine eyes, O my Lord, let my Lord, I pray Thee, go in our middle (for it is a stiff-necked people), and you hast forgiven our iniquity and our sin, and hast inherited us.'
\v 10 And He said, 'Lo, I am making a covenant: before all your people I do wonders, which have not been done in all the earth, or in any nation, and all the people in whose middle you art have seen the work of Yahweh, for it is fearful that which I am doing with thee.
\v 11 'Observe for yourself that which I am commanding thee to-day: lo, I am casting out from before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite;
\v 12 take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land into which you art going, lest it become a snare in your middle;
\v 13 for their altars ye break down, and their standing pillars ye shiver, and its shrines ye cut down;
\v 14 for ye do not bow yourselves to another god — for Yahweh, whose name is Zealous, is a zealous God.
\v 15 Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land, and they have gone a-whoring after their gods, and have sacrificed to their gods, and one had called to thee, and you hast eaten of his sacrifice,
\v 16 and you hast taken of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters have gone a-whoring after their gods, and have caused your sons to go a-whoring after their gods;
\v 17 a molten god you will not make to yourself.
\v 18 'The feast of unleavened things you will keep; seven days you will eat unleavened things, as I have commanded thee, at an appointed time, the month of Abib: for in the month of Abib you did come out from Egypt.
\v 19 All opening a womb are Mine, and every firstling of your cattle born a male, ox or sheep;
\v 20 and the firstling of an ass you will ransom with a lamb; and if you will not ransom, then you hast beheaded it; every first-born of your sons you will ransom, and they do not appear before Me empty.
\v 21 'Six days you will work, and on the seventh day you will rest; in ploughing-time and in harvest you will rest.
\v 22 'And a feast of weeks you will observe for yourself; first-fruits of wheat-harvest; and the feast of in-gathering, at the revolution of the year.
\v 23 'Three times in a year do all your males appear before the Lord Yahweh, God of Israel;
\v 24 for I dispossess nations from before thee, and have enlarged your border, and no man did desire your land in your going up to appear before Yahweh your God three times in a year.
\v 25 'Thou will not slaughter with a fermented thing the blood of My sacrifice; and the sacrifice of the feast of the passover did not remain till morning:
\v 26 the first of the first-fruits of the land you will bring into the house of Yahweh your God; you will not boil a kid in its mother's milk.'
\v 27 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Write for yourself these words, for, according to the tenor of these words I have made with thee a covenant, and with Israel.'
\v 28 And he is there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; bread he had not eaten, and water he had not drunk; and he writeth on the tables the matters of the covenant — the ten matters.
\v 29 And it came to pass, when Moses is coming down from mount Sinai (and the two tables of the testimony are in the hand of Moses in his coming down from the mount), that Moses had not known that the skin of his face had shone in His speaking with him,
\v 30 and Aaron saw — all the sons of Israel also — Moses, and lo, the skin of his face had shone, and they are afraid of coming nigh unto him.
\v 31 And Moses called unto them, and Aaron and all the princes in the company return unto him, and Moses spoke unto them;
\v 32 and afterwards have all the sons of Israel come nigh, and he chargeth them with all that Yahweh had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
\v 33 And Moses finisheth speaking with them, and putteth on his face a vail;
\v 34 and in the going in of Moses before Yahweh to speak with Him, he turneth aside the vail until his coming out; and he had come out and had spoken unto the sons of Israel that which he is commanded;
\v 35 and the sons of Israel have seen the face of Moses that the skin of the face of Moses had shone, and Moses had put back the vail on his face until his going in to speak with Him.
\c 35
\v 1 And Moses assembleth all the company of the sons of Israel, and said unto them, 'These are the things which Yahweh had commanded — to do them:
\v 2 Six days is work done, and on the seventh day there is to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to Yahweh; any who doeth work in it is put to death;
\v 3 ye do not burn a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath-day.'
\v 4 And Moses spoke unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, 'This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded, saying,
\v 5 Take ye from among you a heave-offering to Yahweh; every one whose heart is willing did bring it, — the heave-offering of Yahweh, — gold, and silver, and brass,
\v 6 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' hair,
\v 7 and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
\v 8 and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the spice perfume,
\v 9 and shoham stones, and stones for settings, for an ephod, and for a breastplate.
\v 10 'And all the wise-hearted among you come in, and make all that Yahweh had commanded:
\v 11 'The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,
\v 12 'The ark and its staves, the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering,
\v 13 'The table and its staves, and all its vessels, and the bread of the presence,
\v 14 'And the candlestick for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light,
\v 15 'And the altar of perfume, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the spice perfume, and the covering of the opening at the opening of the tabernacle,
\v 16 'The altar of burnt-offering and the brazen grate which it had, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,
\v 17 'The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the covering of the gate of the court,
\v 18 'The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
\v 19 'The coloured garments, to do service in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to act as priest in.'
\v 20 And all the company of the sons of Israel go out from the presence of Moses,
\v 21 and they come in — every man whom his heart had lifted up, and every one whom his spirit had made willing — they have brought in the heave-offering of Yahweh for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.
\v 22 And they come in — the men with the women — every willing-hearted one — they have brought in nose-ring, and ear-ring, and seal-ring, and necklace, all golden goods, even every one who had waved a wave-offering of gold to Yahweh.
\v 23 And every man with whom had been found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, have brought them in;
\v 24 every one lifting up a heave-offering of silver and brass have brought in the heave-offering of Yahweh; and every one with whom had been found shittim wood for any work of the service brought it in.
\v 25 And every wise-hearted woman had spun with her hands, and they bring in yarn, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the linen;
\v 26 and all the women whose heart had lifted them up in wisdom, have spun the goats' hair.
\v 27 And the princes have brought in the shoham stones, and the stones for settings, for the ephod, and for the breastplate,
\v 28 and the spices, and the oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the spice perfume;
\v 29 every man and woman (whom their heart had made willing to bring in for all the work which Yahweh commanded to be done by the hand of Moses) of the sons of Israel brought in a willing-offering to Yahweh.
\v 30 And Moses said unto the sons of Israel, 'See, Yahweh had called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
\v 31 and He did fill him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,
\v 32 even to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\v 33 and in graving of stones for settings, and in graving of wood to work in any work of design.
\v 34 'And to direct He had put in his heart, he and Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan;
\v 35 He had filled them with wisdom of heart to do every work, of engraver, and designer, and embroiderer (in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in linen), and weaver, who do any work, and of designers of designs.
\c 36
\v 1 And Bezaleel, and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Yahweh had given wisdom and understanding to know to do every work of the service of the sanctuary, have done according to all that Yahweh commanded.
\v 2 And Moses called unto Bezaleel, and unto Aholiab, and unto every wise-hearted man in whose heart Yahweh had given wisdom, every one whom his heart lifted up, to come near unto the work to do it.
\v 3 And they take from before Moses all the heave-offering which the sons of Israel have brought in for the work of the service of the sanctuary to do it; and still they have brought in unto him a willing-offering morning by morning.
\v 4 And all the wise men, who are doing all the work of the sanctuary, come each from his work which they are doing,
\v 5 and speak unto Moses, saying, 'The people are multiplying to bring in more than sufficient for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make.'
\v 6 And Moses commandeth, and they cause a voice to pass over through the camp, saying, 'Let not man or woman make any more work for the heave-offering of the sanctuary;' and the people are restrained from bringing,
\v 7 and the work had been sufficient for them, for all the work, to do it, and to leave.
\v 8 And all the wise-hearted ones among the doers of the work make the tabernacle; ten curtains of twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubs, work of a designer, he had made them.
\v 9 The length of the one curtain is eight and twenty by the cubit, and the breadth of the one curtain four by the cubit; one measure is to all the curtains.
\v 10 And he joineth the five curtains one unto another, and the other five curtains he had joined one unto another;
\v 11 and he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain, at the end, in the joining; so he had made in the edge of the outmost curtain, in the joining of the second;
\v 12 fifty loops he had made in the one curtain, and fifty loops had he made in the end of the curtain which is in the joining of the second; the loops are taking hold one on another.
\v 13 And he made fifty hooks of gold, and joineth the curtains one unto another by the hooks, and the tabernacle is one.
\v 14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains he had made them;
\v 15 the length of the one curtain is thirty by the cubit, and the breadth of the one curtain is four cubits; one measure is to the eleven curtains;
\v 16 and he joineth the five curtains apart, and the six curtains apart.
\v 17 And he made fifty loops on the outer edge of the curtain, in the joining; and fifty loops he had made on the edge of the curtain which is joining the second;
\v 18 and he made fifty hooks of brass to join the tent — to be one;
\v 19 and he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins made red, and a covering of badgers' skins above.
\v 20 And he made the boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up;
\v 21 ten cubits is the length of the one board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of the one board;
\v 22 two handles are to the one board, joined one unto another; so he had made for all the boards of the tabernacle.
\v 23 And he made the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward;
\v 24 and forty sockets of silver he had made under the twenty boards, two sockets under the one board for its two handles, and two sockets under the other board for its two handles.
\v 25 And for the second side of the tabernacle, for the north side, he had made twenty boards,
\v 26 and their forty sockets of silver, two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board;
\v 27 and for the sides of the tabernacle, westward, had he made six boards;
\v 28 and two boards had he made for the corners of the tabernacle, in the two sides;
\v 29 and they have been twins below, and together they are twins at its head, at the one ring; so he had done to both of them at the two corners;
\v 30 and there have been eight boards; and their sockets of silver are sixteen sockets, two sockets under the one board.
\v 31 And he made bars of shittim wood, five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
\v 32 and five bars for the boards of the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle, for the sides westward;
\v 33 and he made the middle bar to enter into the middle of the boards from end to end;
\v 34 and the boards he had overlaid with gold, and their rings he had made of gold, places for bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.
\v 35 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of a designer he had made it, with cherubs;
\v 36 and he made for it four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold; their pegs are of gold; and he threw for them four sockets of silver.
\v 37 And he made a covering for the opening of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of an embroiderer,
\v 38 also its five pillars, and their pegs; and he overlaid their tops and their fillets with gold, and their five sockets are brass.
\c 37
\v 1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;
\v 2 and he overlaid it with pure gold within and wiyout, and made for it a wreath of gold round about;
\v 3 and he threw for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;
\v 4 and he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold,
\v 5 and he brought in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
\v 6 And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;
\v 7 and he made two cherubs of gold, of beaten work he had made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;
\v 8 one cherub at the end on this side, and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he had made the cherubs, at its two ends;
\v 9 and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces are one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been.
\v 10 And he made the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,
\v 11 and overlaid it with pure gold, and made for it a wreath of gold round about.
\v 12 And he made for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a wreath of gold for its border round about;
\v 13 and he threw for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which are to its four feet;
\v 14 over-against the border have the rings been, places for staves to bear the table.
\v 15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table;
\v 16 and he made the vessels which are upon the table, its dishes, and its bowls, and its cups, and the cups by which they pour out, of pure gold.
\v 17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he had made the candlestick, its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers, have been of the same;
\v 18 and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of its second side;
\v 19 three calyxes, made like almonds, in the one branch, a knop and a flower; and three calyxes, made like almonds, in another branch, a knop and a flower; so to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick.
\v 20 And in the candlestick are four calyxes, made like almonds, its knops, and its flowers,
\v 21 and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, are to the six branches which are coming out of it;
\v 22 their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.
\v 23 And he made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold;
\v 24 of a talent of pure gold he had made it, and all its vessels.
\v 25 And he made the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth (square), and two cubits its height; its horns have been of the same;
\v 26 and he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about, and its horns; and he made for it a wreath of gold round about;
\v 27 and two rings of gold he had made for it under its wreath, at its two corners, at its two sides, for places for staves to bear it with them.
\v 28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold;
\v 29 and he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure spice-perfume — work of a compounder.
\c 38
\v 1 And he made the altar of burnt-offering of shittim wood, five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth (square), and three cubits its height;
\v 2 and he made its horns on its four corners; its horns have been of the same; and he overlaid it with brass;
\v 3 and he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the sprinkling-pans, the forks, and the fire-pans; all its vessels he had made of brass.
\v 4 And he made for the altar a brazen grate of net-work, under its border beneath, unto its middle;
\v 5 and he threw four rings for the four ends of the brazen grate — places for bars;
\v 6 and he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass;
\v 7 and he brought in the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it with them; hollow with boards he made it.
\v 8 And he made the laver of brass, and its base of brass, with the looking-glasses of the women assembling, who have assembled at the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 9 And he made the court; at the south side southward, the hangings of the court of twined linen, a hundred by the cubit,
\v 10 their pillars are twenty, and their brazen sockets twenty, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are silver;
\v 11 and at the north side, a hundred by the cubit, their pillars are twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are silver;
\v 12 and at the west side are hangings, fifty by the cubit; their pillars are ten, and their sockets ten; the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are silver;
\v 13 and at the east side eastward fifty cubits.
\v 14 The hangings on the side are fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three,
\v 15 and at the second side at the gate of the court, on this and on that, are hangings, fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three;
\v 16 all the hangings of the court round about are of twined linen,
\v 17 and the sockets for the pillars of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets of silver, and the overlaying of their tops of silver, and all the pillars of the court are filleted with silver.
\v 18 And the covering of the gate of the court is the work of an embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen; and twenty cubits is the length, and the height with the breadth five cubits, over-against the hangings of the court;
\v 19 and their pillars are four, and their sockets of brass four, their pegs are of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their fillets are of silver;
\v 20 and all the pins for the tabernacle, and for the court round about, are of brass.
\v 21 These are the numberings of the tabernacle (the tabernacle of testimony), which had been numbered by the command of Moses, the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
\v 22 And Bezaleel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, had made all that Yahweh commanded Moses;
\v 23 and with him is Aholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and designer, and embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in linen.
\v 24 All the gold which is prepared for the work in all the work of the sanctuary (and it is the gold of the wave-offering) is twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary.
\v 25 And the silver of those numbered of the company is a hundred talents, and a yousand and seven hundred and five and seventy shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary;
\v 26 a bekah for a poll (half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary,) for every one who is passing over unto those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upwards, for six hundred yousand, and three yousand, and five hundred and fifty.
\v 27 And a hundred talents of silver are to cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket;
\v 28 and the yousand and seven hundred and five and seventy he had made pegs for the pillars, and overlaid their tops, and filleted them.
\v 29 And the brass of the wave-offering is seventy talents, and two yousand and four hundred shekels;
\v 30 and he made with it the sockets of the opening of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate which it had, and all the vessels of the altar,
\v 31 and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
\c 39
\v 1 And of the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, they made coloured garments, to minister in the sanctuary; and they make the holy garments which are for Aaron, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 2 And he made the ephod, of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen,
\v 3 and they expand the plates of gold, and have cut off wires to work in the middle of the blue, and in the middle of the purple, and in the middle of the scarlet, and in the middle of the linen — work of a designer;
\v 4 shoulder-pieces they have made for it, joining; at its two ends it is joined.
\v 5 And the girdle of his ephod which is on it is of the same, according to its work, of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 6 And they prepare the shoham stones, set, embroidered with gold, opened with openings of a signet, by the names of the sons of Israel;
\v 7 and he setteth them on the shoulders of the ephod — stones of memorial for the sons of Israel, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 8 And he made the breastplate, work of a designer, like the work of the ephod, of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen;
\v 9 it had been square; double they have made the breastplate, a span its length, and a span its breadth, doubled.
\v 10 And they fill in it four rows of stones; a row of a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle is the one row;
\v 11 and the second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
\v 12 and the third row an opal, an agate, and an ameyourst;
\v 13 and the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper — set, embroidered with gold, in their settings.
\v 14 And the stones, according to the names of the sons of Israel, are twelve, according to their names, openings of a signet, each according to his name, for the twelve tribes.
\v 15 And they make on the breastplate wreathed chains, work of thick bands, of pure gold;
\v 16 and they make two embroidered things of gold, and two rings of gold, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate,
\v 17 and they put the two thick bands of gold on the two rings on the ends of the breastplate;
\v 18 and the two ends of the two thick bands they have put on the two embroidered things, and they put them on the shoulders of the ephod, over-against its front.
\v 19 And they make two rings of gold, and set them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its border, which is on the side of the ephod within;
\v 20 and they make two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulders of the ephod below, over-against its front, over-against its joining, above the girdle of the ephod;
\v 21 and they bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod, with a ribbon of blue, to be above the girdle of the ephod, and the breastplate is not loosed from off the ephod, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 22 And he made the upper robe of the ephod, work of a weaver, completely of blue;
\v 23 and the opening of the upper robe is in its middle, as the opening of a habergeon, a border is to its opening round about, it is not rent;
\v 24 and they make on the hems of the upper robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, twined.
\v 25 And they make bells of pure gold, and put the bells in the middle of the pomegranates, on the hems of the upper robe, round about, in the middle of the pomegranates;
\v 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, are on the hems of the upper robe, round about, to minister in, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 27 And they make the coats of linen, work of a weaver, for Aaron and for his sons,
\v 28 and the mitre of linen, and the beautiful bonnets of linen, and the linen trousers, of twined linen,
\v 29 and the girdle of twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, work of an embroiderer, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 30 And they make the flower of the holy crown of pure gold, and write on it a writing, openings of a signet, 'Holy to Yahweh;'
\v 31 and they put on it a ribbon of blue, to put it on the mitre above, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 32 And all the service of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting is completed; and the sons of Israel do according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses; so they have done.
\v 33 And they bring in the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all its vessels, its hooks, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets;
\v 34 and the covering of rams' skins, which are made red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering;
\v 35 the ark of the testimony and its staves, and the mercy-seat;
\v 36 the table, all its vessels, and the bread of the presence;
\v 37 the pure candlestick, its lamps, the lamps of arrangement, and all its vessels, and the oil for the light.
\v 38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the spice-perfume, and the covering of the opening of the tent;
\v 39 the brazen altar and the brazen grate which it had, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base.
\v 40 The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets; and the covering for the gate of the court, its cords, and its pins; and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
\v 41 the coloured clothes to minister in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to act as priest in.
\v 42 According to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done all the service;
\v 43 and Moses saw all the work, and lo, they have done it as Yahweh had commanded; so they have done. And Moses did bless them.
\c 40
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'On the first day of the month, in the first month, you will raise up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,
\v 3 and hast set there the ark of the testimony, and hast covered over the ark with the vail,
\v 4 and hast brought in the table, and set its arrangement in order, and hast brought in the candlestick, and caused its lamps to go up.
\v 5 'And you hast put the golden altar for perfume before the ark of the testimony, and hast put the covering of the opening to the tabernacle,
\v 6 and hast put the altar of the burnt-offering before the opening of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,
\v 7 and hast put the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there.
\v 8 'And you hast set the court round about, and hast placed the covering of the gate of the court,
\v 9 and hast taken the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and hallowed it, and all its vessels, and it had been holy;
\v 10 and you hast anointed the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctified the altar, and the altar had been most holy;
\v 11 and you hast anointed the laver and its base, and sanctified it.
\v 12 'And you hast brought near Aaron and his sons unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and hast bathed them with water;
\v 13 and you hast clothed Aaron with the holy garments, and anointed him, and sanctified him, and he had acted as priest to Me.
\v 14 'And his sons you will bring near, and hast clothed them with coats,
\v 15 and anointed them as you hast anointed their father, and they have acted as priests to Me, and their anointing had been to be to them for a priesthood age-during, to their generations.'
\v 16 And Moses did according to all that Yahweh had commanded him; so he had done.
\v 17 And it came to pass, in the first month, in the second year, in the first of the month, the tabernacle had been raised up;
\v 18 and Moses raiseth up the tabernacle, and setteth its sockets, and placeth its boards, and placeth its bars, and raiseth its pillars,
\v 19 and spreadeth the tent over the tabernacle, and putteth the covering of the tent upon it above, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 20 And he taketh and putteth the testimony unto the ark, and setteth the staves on the ark, and putteth the mercy-seat on the ark above;
\v 21 and brought in the ark unto the tabernacle, and placeth the vail of the covering, and covereth over the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 22 And he putteth the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tabernacle northward, at the outside of the vail,
\v 23 and setteth in order upon it the arrangement of bread, before Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 24 And he putteth the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over-against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward,
\v 25 and caused the lamps to go up before Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 26 And he setteth the golden altar in the tent of meeting, before the vail,
\v 27 and made perfume on it — spice-perfume — as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 28 And he setteth the covering of the opening to the tabernacle,
\v 29 and the altar of the burnt-offering he had set at the opening of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and caused the burnt-offering to go up upon it, and the present, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 30 And he putteth the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and putteth water there for washing,
\v 31 and Moses and Aaron and his sons have washed their hands and their feet at the same;
\v 32 in their going in unto the tent of meeting, and in their drawing near unto the altar, they wash, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 33 And he raiseth up the court round about the tabernacle, and about the altar, and placeth the covering of the gate of the court; and Moses completed the work.
\v 34 And the cloud covereth the tent of meeting, and the honour of Yahweh had filled the tabernacle;
\v 35 and Moses had not been able to go in unto the tent of meeting, for the cloud had tabernacled on it, and the honour of Yahweh had filled the tabernacle.
\v 36 And in the going up of the cloud from off the tabernacle the sons of Israel journey in all their journeys;
\v 37 and if the cloud go not up then they journey not, until the day of its going up:
\v 38 for the cloud of Yahweh is on the tabernacle by day, and fire is in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel in all their journeys.
