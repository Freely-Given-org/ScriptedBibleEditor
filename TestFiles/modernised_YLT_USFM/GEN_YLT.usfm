\c 1
\v 1 In the beginning of God's preparing the heavens and the earth — 
\v 2 the earth had existed waste and void, and darkness is on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God fluttering on the face of the waters,
\v 3 and God said, 'Let light be;' and light is.
\v 4 And God saw the light that it is good, and God separated between the light and the darkness,
\v 5 and God called to the light 'Day,' and to the darkness He had called 'Night;' and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day one.
\v 6 And God said, 'Let an expanse be in the middle of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.'
\v 7 And God made the expanse, and it separated between the waters which are under the expanse, and the waters which are above the expanse: and it is so.
\v 8 And God called to the expanse 'Heavens;' and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day second.
\v 9 And God said, 'Let the waters under the heavens be collected unto one place, and let the dry land be seen:' and it is so.
\v 10 And God called to the dry land 'Earth,' and to the collection of the waters He had called 'Seas;' and God saw that it is good.
\v 11 And God said, 'Let the earth yield tender grass, herb sowing seed, fruit-tree (whose seed is in itself) making fruit after its kind, on the earth:' and it is so.
\v 12 And the earth brought forth tender grass, herb sowing seed after its kind, and tree making fruit (whose seed is in itself) after its kind; and God saw that it is good;
\v 13 and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day third.
\v 14 And God said, 'Let luminaries be in the expanse of the heavens, to make a separation between the day and the night, then they have been for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years,
\v 15 and they have been for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth:' and it is so.
\v 16 And God made the two great luminaries, the great luminary for the rule of the day, and the small luminary — and the stars — for the rule of the night;
\v 17 and God gave them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,
\v 18 and to rule over day and over night, and to make a separation between the light and the darkness; and God saw that it is good;
\v 19 and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day fourth.
\v 20 And God said, 'Let the waters teem with the teeming living creature, and fowl let fly on the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.'
\v 21 And God prepared the great monsters, and every living creature that is creeping, which the waters have teemed with, after their kind, and every fowl with wing, after its kind, and God saw that it is good.
\v 22 And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl let multiply in the earth:'
\v 23 and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day fifth.
\v 24 And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind:' and it is so.
\v 25 And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, and God saw that it is good.
\v 26 And God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.'
\v 27 And God prepared the man in His image; in the image of God He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them.
\v 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over every living thing that is creeping upon the earth.'
\v 29 And God said, 'Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree sowing seed, to you it is for food;
\v 30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which is breath of life, every green herb is for food:' and it is so.
\v 31 And God saw all that He had done, and behold, very good; and there is an evening, and there is a morning — day the sixth.
\c 2
\v 1 And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their host;
\v 2 and God completed by the seventh day His work which He had made, and ceaseth by the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
\v 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctifieth it, for in it He had ceased from all His work which God had prepared for making.
\v 4 These are births of the heavens and of the earth in their being prepared, in the day of Yahweh God's making earth and heavens;
\v 5 and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouteth, for Yahweh God had not rained upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,
\v 6 and a mist went up from the earth, and had watered the whole face of the ground.
\v 7 And Yahweh God formed the man — dust from the ground, and breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
\v 8 And Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden, at the east, and He setteth there the man whom He had formed;
\v 9 and Yahweh God caused to sprout from the ground every tree desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
\v 10 And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it is parted, and had become four chief rivers;
\v 11 the name of the one is Pison, it is that which is surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold is,
\v 12 and the gold of that land is good, there is the bdolach and the shoham stone;
\v 13 and the name of the second river is Gibon, it is that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;
\v 14 and the name of the third river is Hiddekel, it is that which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is Phrat.
\v 15 And Yahweh God took the man, and caused him to rest in the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it.
\v 16 And Yahweh God laid a charge on the man, saying, 'Of every tree of the garden eating you will eat;
\v 17 and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you will not eat of it, for in the day of yours eating of it — dying you will die.'
\v 18 And Yahweh God said, 'Not good for the man to be alone, I do make to him an helper — as his counterpart.'
\v 19 And Yahweh God formed from the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and brought in unto the man, to see what he did call it; and whatever the man called a living creature, that is its name.
\v 20 And the man called names to all the cattle, and to fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man had not been found an helper — as his counterpart.
\v 21 And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he sleepeth, and He took one of his ribs, and closeth up flesh in its stead.
\v 22 And Yahweh God built up the rib which He had taken out of the man into a woman, and brought her in unto the man;
\v 23 and the man said, 'This is the proper step! bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh!' for this it is called Woman, for from a man had this been taken;
\v 24 therefore did a man leave his father and his mother, and had cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh.
\v 25 And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and they are not ashamed of themselves.
\c 3
\v 1 And the serpent had been subtile above every beast of the field which Yahweh God had made, and he said unto the woman, 'Is it true that God had said, Ye do not eat of every tree of the garden?'
\v 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, 'Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we do eat,
\v 3 and of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden God had said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest you die.'
\v 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, 'Dying, you do not die,
\v 5 for God did know that in the day of your eating of it — your eyes have been opened, and you have been as God, knowing good and evil.'
\v 6 And the woman saw that the tree is good for food, and that it is pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to make one wise, and she took of its fruit and eateth, and gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat;
\v 7 and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that they are naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to themselves girdles.
\v 8 And they hear the sound of Yahweh God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his wife hide themselves from the face of Yahweh God in the middle of the trees of the garden.
\v 9 And Yahweh God called unto the man, and said to him, 'Where are you?'
\v 10 and he said, 'Your sound I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.'
\v 11 And He said, 'Who had declared to you that you are naked? of the tree of which I have commanded you not to eat, hast you eaten?'
\v 12 and the man said, 'The woman whom You did place with me — she had given to me of the tree — and I do eat.'
\v 13 And Yahweh God said to the woman, 'What is this you hast done?' and the woman said, 'The serpent had caused me to forget — and I do eat.'
\v 14 And Yahweh God said unto the serpent, 'Because you hast done this, cursed are you above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field: on your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all days of your life;
\v 15 and enmity I put between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he did bruise you — the head, and you will bruise him — the heel.'
\v 16 Unto the woman He said, 'Multiplying I multiply your sorrow and your conception, in sorrow will you bear children, and toward your husband is your desire, and he did rule over you.'
\v 17 And to the man He said, 'Because you hast hearkened to the voice of your wife, and will eat of the tree concerning which I have charged you, saying, You will not eat of it, cursed is the ground on yours account; in sorrow you will eat of it all days of your life,
\v 18 and thorn and bramble it did bring forth to you, and you hast eaten the herb of the field;
\v 19 by the sweat of your face you will eat bread till your return unto the ground, for out of it hast you been taken, for dust you are, and unto dust you turnest back.'
\v 20 And the man called his wife's name Eve: for she had been mother of all living.
\v 21 And Yahweh God did make to the man and to his wife coats of skin, and did clothe them.
\v 22 And Yahweh God said, 'Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and lived to the age,' — 
\v 23 Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to serve the ground from which he had been taken;
\v 24 yea, he threw out the man, and caused to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the tree of life.
\c 4
\v 1 And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and said, 'I have gotten a man by Yahweh;'
\v 2 and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain had been servant of the ground.
\v 3 And it came to pass at the end of days that Cain brought from the fruit of the ground a present to Yahweh;
\v 4 and Abel, he had brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Yahweh looketh unto Abel and unto his present,
\v 5 and unto Cain and unto his present He had not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.
\v 6 And Yahweh said unto Cain, 'Why hast you displeasure? and why had your countenance fallen?
\v 7 Is there not, if you will well, acceptance? and if you will not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto you its desire, and you rulest over it.'
\v 8 And Cain said unto Abel his brother, 'Let us go into the field;' and it came to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slaid him.
\v 9 And Yahweh said unto Cain, 'Where is Abel your brother?' and he said, 'I have not known; my brother's keeper — I?'
\v 10 And He said, 'What hast you done? the voice of your brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;
\v 11 and now, cursed are you from the ground, which had opened her mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand;
\v 12 when you tillest the ground, it did not add to give its strength to you — a wanderer, even a trembling one, you are in the earth.'
\v 13 And Cain said unto Yahweh, 'Greater is my punishment than to be borne;
\v 14 behold, You hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Your face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it had been — every one finding me did slay me.'
\v 15 And Yahweh said to him, 'Therefore — of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Yahweh setteth to Cain a token that none finding him did slay him.
\v 16 And Cain went out from before Yahweh, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden;
\v 17 and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and he called the name of the city, according to the name of his son — Enoch.
\v 18 And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad had begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael had begotten Methusael; and Methusael had begotten Lamech.
\v 19 And Lamech took to himself two wives, the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.
\v 20 And Adah beareth Jabal, he had been father of those inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;
\v 21 and the name of his brother is Jubal, he had been father of every one handling harp and organ.
\v 22 And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain is Naamah.
\v 23 And Lamech said to his wives: — 'Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear to my saying: For a man I have killed for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;
\v 24 For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy and sevenfold.'
\v 25 And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and called his name Seth, 'for God had appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:' for Cain had killed him.
\v 26 And to Seth, to him also a son had been born, and he called his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Yahweh.
\c 5
\v 1 This is an account of the births of Adam: In the day of God's preparing man, in the likeness of God He had made him;
\v 2 a male and a female He had prepared them, and He blessed them, and called their name Man, in the day of their being prepared.
\v 3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begetteth a son in his likeness, according to his image, and called his name Seth.
\v 4 And the days of Adam after his begetting Seth are eight hundred years, and he begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 5 And all the days of Adam which he lived are nine hundred and thirty years, and he dieth.
\v 6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begetteth Enos.
\v 7 And Seth lived after his begetting Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 8 And all the days of Seth are nine hundred and twelve years, and he dieth.
\v 9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begetteth Cainan.
\v 10 And Enos lived after his begetting Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 11 And all the days of Enos are nine hundred and five years, and he dieth.
\v 12 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begetteth Mahalaleel.
\v 13 And Cainan lived after his begetting Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 14 And all the days of Cainan are nine hundred and ten years, and he dieth.
\v 15 And Mahalaleel lived five and sixty years, and begetteth Jared.
\v 16 And Mahalaleel lived after his begetting Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 17 And all the days of Mahalaleel are eight hundred and ninety and five years, and he dieth.
\v 18 And Jared lived an hundred and sixty and two years, and begetteth Enoch.
\v 19 And Jared lived after his begetting Enoch eight hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 20 And all the days of Jared are nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he dieth.
\v 21 And Enoch lived five and sixty years, and begetteth Methuselah.
\v 22 And Enoch walks habitually with God after his begetting Methuselah three hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 23 And all the days of Enoch are three hundred and sixty and five years.
\v 24 And Enoch walks habitually with God, and he is not, for God had taken him.
\v 25 And Methuselah lived an hundred and eighty and seven years, and begetteth Lamech.
\v 26 And Methuselah lived after his begetting Lamech seven hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 27 And all the days of Methuselah are nine hundred and sixty and nine years, and he dieth.
\v 28 And Lamech lived an hundred and eighty and two years, and begetteth a son,
\v 29 and called his name Noah, saying, 'This one did comfort us concerning our work, and concerning the labour of our hands, because of the ground which Yahweh had cursed.'
\v 30 And Lamech lived after his begetting Noah five hundred and ninety and five years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 31 And all the days of Lamech are seven hundred and seventy and seven years, and he dieth.
\v 32 And Noah is a son of five hundred years, and Noah begetteth Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\c 6
\v 1 And it came to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them,
\v 2 and sons of God see the daughters of men that they are fair, and they take to themselves women of all whom they have chosen.
\v 3 And Yahweh said, 'My Spirit did not strive in man — to the age; in their erring they are flesh:' and his days have been an hundred and twenty years.
\v 4 The fallen ones were in the earth in those days, and even afterwards when sons of God come in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them — they are the heroes, who, from of old, are the men of name.
\v 5 And Yahweh saw that abundant is the wickedness of man in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil all the day;
\v 6 and Yahweh repenteth that He had made man in the earth, and He grieveth Himself — unto His heart.
\v 7 And Yahweh said, 'I wipe away man whom I have prepared from off the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens, for I have repented that I have made them.'
\v 8 And Noah found grace in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 9 These are births of Noah: Noah is a righteous man; perfect he had been among his generations; with God had Noah walked habitually.
\v 10 And Noah begetteth three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\v 11 And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled with violence.
\v 12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it had been corrupted, for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth.
\v 13 And God said to Noah, 'An end of all flesh had come before Me, for the earth had been full of violence from their presence; and behold, I am destroying them with the earth.
\v 14 'Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood; rooms will you make with the ark, and you hast covered it within and without with cypress;
\v 15 and this is that which you will with it: three hundred cubits is the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height;
\v 16 a window will you make for the ark, and unto a cubit you will restrain it from above; and the opening of the ark you will put in its side, — lower, second, and third stories will you make it.
\v 17 And I, behold, I am bringing in the deluge of waters on the earth to destroy all flesh, in which is a living spirit, from under the heavens; all that is in the earth did expire.
\v 18 'And I have established My covenant with you, and you hast come in unto the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your son's wives with you;
\v 19 and of all that lived, of all flesh, two of every sort you will bring in unto the ark, to keep alive with you; male and female are they.
\v 20 Of the fowl after its kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort they come in unto you, to keep alive.
\v 21 'And you, take to thyself of all food that is eaten; and you hast gathered unto thyself, and it had been to you and to them for food.'
\v 22 And Noah did according to all that God had commanded him; so had he done.
\c 7
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Noah, 'Come in, you and all your house, unto the ark, for you I have seen righteous before Me in this generation;
\v 2 of all the clean beasts you will take to you seven pairs, a male and its female; and of the beasts which are not clean two, a male and its female;
\v 3 also, of fowl of the heavens seven pairs, a male and a female, to keep alive seed on the face of all the earth;
\v 4 for after other seven days I am sending rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and have wiped away all the substance that I have made from off the face of the ground.'
\v 5 And Noah did according to all that Yahweh had commanded him:
\v 6 and Noah is a son of six hundred years, and the deluge of waters had been upon the earth.
\v 7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, unto the ark, from the presence of the waters of the deluge;
\v 8 of the clean beasts and of the beasts that are not clean, and of the fowl, and of every thing that is creeping upon the ground,
\v 9 two by two they have come in unto Noah, unto the ark, a male and a female, as God had commanded Noah.
\v 10 And it came to pass, after the seventh of the days, that waters of the deluge have been on the earth.
\v 11 In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, in this day have been broken up all fountains of the great deep, and the net-work of the heavens had been opened,
\v 12 and the shower is on the earth forty days and forty nights.
\v 13 In this self-same day went in Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, unto the ark;
\v 14 they, and every living creature after its kind, and every beast after its kind, and every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird — every wing.
\v 15 And they come in unto Noah, unto the ark, two by two of all the flesh in which is a living spirit;
\v 16 and they that are coming in, male and female of all flesh, have come in as God had commanded him, and Yahweh did close it for him.
\v 17 And the deluge is forty days on the earth, and the waters multiply, and lift up the ark, and it is raised up from off the earth;
\v 18 and the waters are mighty, and multiply exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.
\v 19 And the waters have been very very mighty on the earth, and covered are all the high mountains which are under the whole heavens;
\v 20 fifteen cubits upwards have the waters become mighty, and the mountains are covered;
\v 21 and expire did all flesh that is moving on the earth, among fowl, and among cattle, and among beasts, and among all the teeming things which are teeming on the earth, and all mankind;
\v 22 all in whose nostrils is breath of a living spirit — of all that is in the dry land — have died.
\v 23 And wiped away is all the substance that is on the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens; yea, they are wiped away from the earth, and only Noah is left, and those who are with him in the ark;
\v 24 and the waters are mighty on the earth a hundred and fifty days.
\c 8
\v 1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle which are with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subside,
\v 2 and closed are the fountains of the deep and the net-work of the heavens, and restrained is the shower from the heavens.
\v 3 And turn back do the waters from off the earth, going on and returning; and the waters are lacking at the end of a hundred and fifty days.
\v 4 And the ark rested, in the seventh month, in the seventeenth day of the month, on mountains of Ararat;
\v 5 and the waters have been going and becoming lacking till the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first of the month, appeared the heads of the mountains.
\v 6 And it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he made,
\v 7 and he sent forth the raven, and it went out, going out and turning back till the drying of the waters from off the earth.
\v 8 And he sent forth the dove from him to see whether the waters have been lightened from off the face of the ground,
\v 9 and the dove had not found rest for the sole of her foot, and she turneth back unto him, unto the ark, for waters are on the face of all the earth, and he putteth out his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him, unto the ark.
\v 10 And he stayeth yet other seven days, and addeth to send forth the dove from the ark;
\v 11 and the dove came in unto him at even-time, and behold, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth; and Noah knoweth that the waters have been lightened from off the earth.
\v 12 And he stayeth yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove, and it added not to turn back unto him any more.
\v 13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, in the first of the month, the waters have been dried from off the earth; and Noah turneth aside the covering of the ark, and looketh, and behold, the face of the ground had been dried.
\v 14 And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth had become dry.
\v 15 And God spoke unto Noah, saying, 'Go out from the ark, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you;
\v 16 every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, among fowl, and among cattle, and among every creeping thing which is creeping on the earth, bring out with you;
\v 17 and they have teemed in the earth, and been fruitful, and have multiplied on the earth.'
\v 18 And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him;
\v 19 every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl; every creeping thing on the earth, after their families, have gone out from the ark.
\v 20 And Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and caused burnt-offerings to ascend on the altar;
\v 21 and Yahweh smelled the sweet fragrance, and Yahweh said unto His heart, 'I continue not to disesteem any more the ground because of man, though the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth; and I continue not to smite any more all living, as I have done;
\v 22 during all days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, do not cease.'
\c 9
\v 1 And God blessed Noah, and his sons, and said to them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth;
\v 2 and your fear and your dread is on every beast of the earth, and on every fowl of the heavens, on all that creepeth on the ground, and on all fishes of the sea — into your hand they have been given.
\v 3 Every creeping thing that is alive, to you it is for food; as the green herb I have given to you the whole;
\v 4 only flesh in its life — its blood — you do not eat.
\v 5 'And only your blood for your lives do I require; from the hand of every living thing I require it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of every man's brother I require the life of man;
\v 6 whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man is his blood shed: for in the image of God had He made man.
\v 7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, teem in the earth, and multiply in it.'
\v 8 And God spoke unto Noah, and unto his sons with him, saying,
\v 9 'And I, behold, I am establishing My covenant with you, and with your seed after you,
\v 10 and with every living creature which is with you, among fowl, among cattle, and among every beast of the earth with you, from all who are going out of the ark — to every beast of the earth.
\v 11 And I have established My covenant with you, and all flesh is not any more cut off by waters of a deluge, and there is not any more a deluge to destroy the earth.'
\v 12 And God said, 'This is a token of the covenant which I am giving between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, to generations age-during;
\v 13 My bow I have given in the cloud, and it had been for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth;
\v 14 and it had come to pass (in My sending a cloud over the earth) that the bow had been seen in the cloud,
\v 15 and I have remembered My covenant which is between Me and you, and every living creature among all flesh, and the waters become no more a deluge to destroy all flesh;
\v 16 and the bow had been in the cloud, and I have seen it — to remember the covenant age-during between God and every living creature among all flesh which is on the earth.'
\v 17 And God said unto Noah, 'This is a token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.'
\v 18 And the sons of Noah who are going out of the ark are Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is father of Canaan.
\v 19 These three are sons of Noah, and from these had all the earth been overspread.
\v 20 And Noah remaineth a man of the ground, and planted a vineyard,
\v 21 and drinketh of the wine, and is drunken, and uncovereth himself in the middle of the tent.
\v 22 And Ham, father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and declareth to his two brethren without.
\v 23 And Shem took — Japheth also — the garment, and they place on the shoulder of them both, and go backward, and cover the nakedness of their father; and their faces are backward, and their father's nakedness they have not seen.
\v 24 And Noah awaketh from his wine, and knoweth that which his young son had done to him,
\v 25 and said: 'Cursed is Canaan, Servant of servants he is to his brethren.'
\v 26 And he said: 'Blessed of Yahweh my God is Shem, And Canaan is servant to him.
\v 27 God did give beauty to Japheth, And he dwelleth in tents of Shem, And Canaan is servant to him.'
\v 28 And Noah lived after the deluge three hundred and fifty years;
\v 29 and all the days of Noah are nine hundred and fifty years, and he dieth.
\c 10
\v 1 And these are births of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and born to them are sons after the deluge.
\v 2 Sons of Japheth are Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
\v 3 And sons of Gomer are Ashkenaz, and Riphad, and Togarmah.
\v 4 And sons of Javan are Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\v 5 By these have the isles of the nations been parted in their lands, each by his tongue, by their families, in their nations.
\v 6 And sons of Ham are Cush, and Mitzraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
\v 7 And sons of Cush are Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah are Sheba and Dedan.
\v 8 And Cush had begotten Nimrod;
\v 9 he had begun to be a hero in the land; he had been a hero in hunting before Yahweh; therefore it is said, 'As Nimrod the hero in hunting before Yahweh.'
\v 10 And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;
\v 11 from that land he had gone out to Asshur, and built Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,
\v 12 and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; it is the great city.
\v 13 And Mitzraim had begotten the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,
\v 14 and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, (whence have come out Philistim,) and the Caphtorim.
\v 15 And Canaan had begotten Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
\v 16 and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
\v 17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
\v 18 and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterwards have the families of the Canaanite been scattered.
\v 19 And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, in your coming towards Gerar, unto Gaza; in your coming towards Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, unto Lasha.
\v 20 These are sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
\v 21 As to Shem, father of all sons of Eber, brother of Japheth the elder, he had also begotten:
\v 22 Sons of Shem are Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
\v 23 And sons of Aram are Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
\v 24 And Arphaxad had begotten Salah, and Salah had begotten Eber.
\v 25 And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one is Peleg (for in his days had the earth been divided,) and his brother's name is Joktan.
\v 26 And Joktan had begotten Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
\v 27 and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
\v 28 and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
\v 29 and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these are sons of Joktan;
\v 30 and their dwelling is from Mesha, in your coming towards Sephar, a mount of the east.
\v 31 These are sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations.
\v 32 These are families of the sons of Noah, by their births, in their nations, and by these have the nations been parted in the earth after the deluge.
\c 11
\v 1 And the whole earth is of one pronunciation, and of the same words,
\v 2 and it came to pass, in their journeying from the east, that they find a valley in the land of Shinar, and dwell there;
\v 3 and they say each one to his neighbour, 'Give help, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly:' and the brick is to them for stone, and the bitumen had been to them for mortar.
\v 4 And they say, 'Give help, let us build for ourselves a city and tower, and its head in the heavens, and make for ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.'
\v 5 And Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have builded;
\v 6 and Yahweh said, 'Lo, the people is one, and one pronunciation is to them all, and this it had dreamed of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that which they have purposed to do.
\v 7 Give help, let us go down, and mingle there their pronunciation, so that a man did not understand the pronunciation of his companion.'
\v 8 And Yahweh did scatter them from there over the face of all the earth, and they cease to build the city;
\v 9 therefore had one called its name Babel, for there had Yahweh mingled the pronunciation of all the earth, and from there had Yahweh scattered them over the face of all the earth.
\v 10 These are births of Shem: Shem is a son of an hundred years, and begetteth Arphaxad two years after the deluge.
\v 11 And Shem lived after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 12 And Arphaxad had lived five and thirty years, and begetteth Salah.
\v 13 And Arphaxad lived after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 14 And Salah had lived thirty years, and begetteth Eber.
\v 15 And Salah lived after his begetting Eber four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begetteth Peleg.
\v 17 And Eber lived after his begetting Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begetteth Reu.
\v 19 And Peleg lived after his begetting Reu two hundred and nine years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begetteth Serug.
\v 21 And Reu lived after his begetting Serug two hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begetteth Nahor.
\v 23 And Serug lived after his begetting Nahor two hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begetteth Terah.
\v 25 And Nahor lived after his begetting Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters.
\v 26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begetteth Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\v 27 And these are births of Terah: Terah had begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran had begotten Lot;
\v 28 and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\v 29 And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife is Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife is Milcah, daughter of Haran, father of Milcah, and father of Iscah.
\v 30 And Sarai is barren — she had no child.
\v 31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot, son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram his son, and they go out with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come unto Charan, and dwell there.
\v 32 And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years, and Terah dieth in Charan.
\c 12
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Abram, 'Go for thyself, from your land, and from your kindred, and from the house of your father, unto the land which I shew you.
\v 2 And I make you become a great nation, and bless you, and make your name great; and be you a blessing.
\v 3 And I bless those blessing you, and him who is disesteeming you I curse, and blessed in you have been all families of the ground.'
\v 4 And Abram went on, as Yahweh had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him, and Abram is a son of five and seventy years in his going out from Charan.
\v 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they have gained, and the persons that they have obtained in Charan; and they go out to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come in to the land of Canaan.
\v 6 And Abram passeth over into the land, unto the place Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh; and the Canaanite is then in the land.
\v 7 And Yahweh appeareth unto Abram, and said, 'To your seed I give this land;' and he built there an altar to Yahweh, who had appeared unto him.
\v 8 And he removeth from there towards a mountain at the east of Beth-El, and stretcheth out the tent (Beth-El at the west, and Hai at the east), and he built there an altar to Yahweh, and preacheth in the name of Yahweh.
\v 9 And Abram journeyeth, going on and journeying towards the south.
\v 10 And there is a famine in the land, and Abram went down towards Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine is grievous in the land;
\v 11 and it came to pass as he had drawn near to enter Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, 'Lo, I pray you, I have known that you are a woman of beautiful appearance;
\v 12 and it had come to pass that the Egyptians see you, and they have said, 'This is his wife,' and they have killed me, and you they keep alive:
\v 13 say, I pray you, you are my sister, so that it is well with me because of you, and my soul had lived for your sake.'
\v 14 And it came to pass, at the entering of Abram into Egypt, that the Egyptians see the woman that she is exceeding fair;
\v 15 and princes of Pharaoh see her, and praise her unto Pharaoh, and the woman is taken to Pharaoh's house;
\v 16 and to Abram he had done good because of her, and he had sheep and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and handmaids, and she-asses, and camels.
\v 17 And Yahweh plagueth Pharaoh and his house — great plagues — for the matter of Sarai, Abram's wife.
\v 18 And Pharaoh called for Abram, and said, 'What is this you hast done to me? why hast you not declared to me that she is your wife?
\v 19 Why hast you said, She is my sister, and I take her to myself for a wife? and now, behold, your wife, take and go.'
\v 20 And Pharaoh chargeth men concerning him, and they send him away, and his wife, an all that he had.
\c 13
\v 1 And Abram went up from Egypt (he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him) towards the south;
\v 2 and Abram is exceedingly wealthy in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
\v 3 And he went on his journeyings from the south, even unto Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the commencement, between Bethel and Hai — 
\v 4 unto the place of the altar which he made there at the first, and there did Abram preach in the name of Yahweh.
\v 5 And also to Lot, who is going with Abram, there had been sheep and oxen and tents;
\v 6 and the land had not suffered them to dwell together, for their substance had been much, and they have not been able to dwell together;
\v 7 and there is a strife between those feeding Abram's cattle and those feeding Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite are then dwelling in the land.
\v 8 And Abram said unto Lot, 'Let there not, I pray you, be strife between me and you, and between my shepherds and your shepherds, for we are men — brethren.
\v 9 Is not all the land before you? be parted, I pray you, from me; if to the left, then I to the right; and if to the right, then I to the left.'
\v 10 And Lot lifteth up his eyes, and saw the whole circuit of the Jordan that it is all a watered country (before Yahweh's destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, as Yahweh's garden, as the land of Egypt,) in your coming toward Zoar,
\v 11 and Lot chooseth for himself the whole circuit of the Jordan; and Lot journeyeth from the east, and they are parted — a man from his companion;
\v 12 Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot had dwelt in the cities of the circuit, and tenteth unto Sodom;
\v 13 and the men of Sodom are evil, and sinners before Yahweh exceedingly.
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto Abram, after Lot's being parted from him, 'Lift up, I pray you, yours eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;
\v 15 for the whole of the land which you are seeing, to you I give it, and to your seed — to the age.
\v 16 And I have set your seed as dust of the earth, so that, if one is able to number the dust of the earth, even your seed is numbered;
\v 17 rise, go up and down through the land, to its length, and to its breadth, for to you I give it.'
\v 18 And Abram tenteth, and came, and dwelleth among the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar to Yahweh.
\c 14
\v 1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim,
\v 2 they have made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
\v 3 All these have been joined together unto the valley of Siddim, which is the Salt Sea;
\v 4 twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they rebelled.
\v 5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings who are with him, and they smite the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
\v 6 and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-Paran, which is by the wilderness;
\v 7 and they turn back and come in unto En-Mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smite the whole field of the Amalekite, and also the Amorite who is dwelling in Hazezon-Tamar.
\v 8 And the king of Sodom went out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar; and they set the battle in array with them in the valley of Siddim,
\v 9 with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with the five.
\v 10 And the valley of Siddim is full of bitumen-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah flee, and fall there, and those left have fled to the mountain.
\v 11 And they take the whole substance of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the whole of their food, and go away;
\v 12 and they take Lot, Abram's brother's son (seeing he is dwelling in Sodom), and his substance, and go away.
\v 13 And one who is escaping came and declareth to Abram the Hebrew, and he is dwelling among the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and they are Abram's allies.
\v 14 And Abram heareth that his brother had been taken captive, and he draweth out his trained domestics, three hundred and eighteen, and pursueth unto Dan.
\v 15 And he divideth himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smiteth them, and pursueth them unto Hobah, which is at the left of Damascus;
\v 16 and he brought back the whole of the substance, and also Lot his brother and his substance had he brought back, and also the women and the people.
\v 17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him (after his turning back from the smiting of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings who are with him), unto the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's valley.
\v 18 And Melchizedek king of Salem had brought out bread and wine, and he is priest of God Most High;
\v 19 and he blessed him, and said, 'Blessed is Abram to God Most High, possessing heaven and earth;
\v 20 and blessed is God Most High, who had delivered yours adversaries into your hand;' and he gave to him a tenth of all.
\v 21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, 'Give to me the persons, and the substance take to thyself,'
\v 22 and Abram said unto the king of Sodom, 'I have lifted up my hand unto Yahweh, God Most High, possessing heaven and earth — 
\v 23 from a thread even unto a shoe-latchet I take not of anything which you hast, that you say not, I — I have made Abram rich;
\v 24 save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who have gone with me — Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre — they take their portion.'
\c 15
\v 1 After these things had the word of Yahweh been unto Abram in a vision, saying, 'Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to you, your reward is exceeding great.'
\v 2 And Abram said, 'Lord Yahweh, what will You give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.'
\v 3 And Abram said, 'Lo, to me You hast not given seed, and behold, a domestic did heir me.'
\v 4 And behold, the word of Yahweh is unto him, saying, 'This one did not heir you; but he who came out from your bowels, he did heir you;'
\v 5 and He brought him out without, and said, 'Look attentively, I pray you, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them;' and He said to him, 'Thus is your seed.'
\v 6 And he had believed in Yahweh, and He reckoneth it to him — righteousness.
\v 7 And He said unto him, 'I am Yahweh who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to you this land to possess it;'
\v 8 and he said, 'Lord Yahweh, whereby do I know that I possess it?'
\v 9 And He said unto him, 'Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;'
\v 10 and he took to him all these, and separated them in the middle, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he had not divided;
\v 11 and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram caused them to turn back.
\v 12 And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep had fallen upon Abram, and behold, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;
\v 13 and He said to Abram, 'knowing — know that your seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,
\v 14 and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;
\v 15 and you — you comest in unto your fathers in peace; you are buried in a good old age;
\v 16 and the fourth generation did turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.'
\v 17 And it came to pass — the sun had gone in, and thick darkness had been — and behold, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which had passed over between those pieces.
\v 18 In that day had Yahweh made with Abram a covenant, saying, 'To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,
\v 19 with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
\v 20 and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
\v 21 and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'
\c 16
\v 1 And Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne to him, and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, and her name is Hagar;
\v 2 and Sarai said unto Abram, 'Lo, I pray you, Yahweh had restrained me from bearing, go in, I pray you, unto my handmaid; perhaps I am built up from her;' and Abram hearkeneth to the voice of Sarai.
\v 3 And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, at the end of the tenth year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband, to him for a wife,
\v 4 and he went in unto Hagar, and she conceiveth, and she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress is lightly esteemed in her eyes.
\v 5 And Sarai said unto Abram, 'My violence is for you; I — I have given mine handmaid into your bosom, and she saw that she had conceived, and I am lightly esteemed in her eyes; Yahweh did judge between me and you.'
\v 6 And Abram said unto Sarai, 'Lo, yours handmaid is in yours hand, do to her that which is good in yours eyes;' and Sarai afflicted her, and she fleeth from her presence.
\v 7 And a messenger of Yahweh finds her by the fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur,
\v 8 and he said, 'Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence hast you come, and where will you go?' and she said, 'From the presence of Sarai, my mistress, I am fleeing.'
\v 9 And the messenger of Yahweh said to her, 'Turn back unto your mistress, and humble thyself under her hands;'
\v 10 and the messenger of Yahweh said to her, 'Multiplying I multiply your seed, and it is not numbered from multitude;'
\v 11 and the messenger of Yahweh said to her, 'Behold you are conceiving, and bearing a son, and hast called his name Ishmael, for Yahweh had hearkened unto yours affliction;
\v 12 and he is a wild-ass man, his hand against every one, and every one's hand against him — and before the face of all his brethren he dwelleth.'
\v 13 And she called the name of Yahweh who is speaking unto her, 'You are, O God, my beholder;' for she said, 'Even here have I looked behind my beholder?'
\v 14 therefore had one called the well, 'The well of the Living One, my beholder;' behold, between Kadesh and Bered.
\v 15 And Hagar beareth to Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar had borne, Ishmael;
\v 16 and Abram is a son of eighty and six years in Hagar's bearing Ishmael to Abram.
\c 17
\v 1 And Abram is a son of ninety and nine years, and Yahweh appeareth unto Abram, and said unto him, 'I am God Almighty, walk habitually before Me, and be you perfect;
\v 2 and I give My covenant between Me and you, and multiply you very exceedingly.'
\v 3 And Abram falleth upon his face, and God spoke with him, saying,
\v 4 I — behold, My covenant is with you, and you hast become father of a multitude of nations;
\v 5 and your name is no more called Abram, but your name had been Abraham, for father of a multitude of nations have I made you;
\v 6 and I have made you exceeding fruitful, and made you become nations, and kings go out from you.
\v 7 'And I have established My covenant between Me and you, and your seed after you, to their generations, for a covenant age-during, to become God to you, and to your seed after you;
\v 8 and I have given to you, and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, for a possession age-during, and I have become their God.'
\v 9 And God said unto Abraham, 'And you will keep My covenant, you and your seed after you, to their generations;
\v 10 this is My covenant which you keep between Me and you, and your seed after you: Every male of you is to be circumcised;
\v 11 and you have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin, and it had become a token of a covenant between Me and you.
\v 12 'And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male to your generations, born in the house, or bought with money from any son of a stranger, who is not of your seed;
\v 13 he is certainly circumcised who is born in yours house, or bought with your money; and My covenant had become in your flesh a covenant age-during;
\v 14 and an uncircumcised one, a male, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised, even that person had been cut off from his people; My covenant he had broken.'
\v 15 And God said unto Abraham, 'Sarai your wife — you will not call her name Sarai, for Sarah is her name;
\v 16 and I have blessed her, and have also given to you a son from her; and I have blessed her, and she had become nations — kings of peoples are from her.'
\v 17 And Abraham falleth upon his face, and laugheth, and said in his heart, 'To the son of an hundred years is one born? or did Sarah — daughter of ninety years — bear?'
\v 18 And Abraham said unto God, 'O that Ishmael may live before Thee;'
\v 19 and God said, 'Sarah your wife is certainly bearing a son to you, and you hast called his name Isaac, and I have established My covenant with him, for a covenant age-during, to his seed after him.
\v 20 As to Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him, and made him fruitful, and multiplied him, very exceedingly; twelve princes did he beget, and I have made him become a great nation;
\v 21 and My covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah did bear to you at this appointed time in the next year;'
\v 22 and He finisheth speaking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
\v 23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with his money — every male among the men of Abraham's house — and circumciseth the flesh of their foreskin, in this self-same day, as God had spoken with him.
\v 24 And Abraham is a son of ninety and nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
\v 25 and Ishmael his son is a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;
\v 26 in this self-same day had Abraham been circumcised, and Ishmael his son;
\v 27 and all the men of his house — born in the house, and bought with money from the son of a stranger — have been circumcised with him.
\c 18
\v 1 And Yahweh appeareth unto him among the oaks of Mamre, and he is sitting at the opening of the tent, about the heat of the day;
\v 2 and he lifteth up his eyes and looketh, and behold, three men standing by him, and he saw, and runneth to meet them from the opening of the tent, and boweth himself towards the earth,
\v 3 And he said, 'My Lord, if, I pray you, I have found grace in yours eyes, do not, I pray you, pass on from your servant;
\v 4 let, I pray you, a little water be accepted, and wash your feet, and recline under the tree;
\v 5 and I bring a piece of bread, and support you your heart; afterwards pass on, for therefore have you passed over unto your servant;' and they say, 'So may you do as you has spoken.'
\v 6 And Abraham hasteth towards the tent, unto Sarah, and said, 'Hasten three measures of flour-meal, knead, and make cakes;'
\v 7 and Abraham ran unto the herd, and took a son of the herd, tender and good, and gave unto the young man, and he hasteth to prepare it;
\v 8 and he took butter and milk, and the son of the herd which he had prepared, and setteth before them; and he is standing by them under the tree, and they do eat.
\v 9 And they say unto him, 'Where is Sarah your wife?' and he said, 'Lo — in the tent;'
\v 10 and he said, 'returning I return unto you, about the time of life, and behold, to Sarah your wife a son.'
\v 11 And Sarah is hearkening at the opening of the tent, which is behind him;
\v 12 and Abraham and Sarah are aged, entering into days — the way of women had ceased to be to Sarah;
\v 13 and Sarah laugheth in her heart, saying, 'After I have waxed old I have had pleasure! — my lord also is old!'
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto Abraham, 'Why is this? Sarah had laughed, saying, Is it true really — I bear — and I am aged? Is any thing too wonderful for Yahweh? at the appointed time I return unto you, about the time of life, and Sarah had a son.'
\v 15 And Sarah denieth, saying, 'I did not laugh;' for she had been afraid; and He said, 'Nay, but you did laugh.'
\v 16 And the men rise from there, and look on the face of Sodom, and Abraham is going with them to send them away;
\v 17 and Yahweh said, 'Am I concealing from Abraham that which I am doing,
\v 18 and Abraham certainly became a nation great and mighty, and blessed in him have been all nations of the earth?
\v 19 for I have known him, that he commandeth his children, and his house after him (and they have kept the way of Yahweh), to do righteousness and judgment, that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which He had spoken concerning him.'
\v 20 And Yahweh said, 'The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah — because great; and their sin — because exceeding grievous:
\v 21 I go down now, and see whether according to its cry which is coming unto Me they have done completely — and if not — I know;'
\v 22 and the men turn from there, and go towards Sodom; and Abraham is yet standing before Yahweh.
\v 23 And Abraham draweth nigh and said, 'Dost You also consume righteous with wicked?
\v 24 peradventure there are fifty righteous in the middle of the city; will You also consume, and not bear with the place for the sake of the fifty — the righteous who are in its middle?
\v 25 Far be it from Thee to do according to this thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked; that it had been — as the righteous so the wicked — far be it from Thee; did the Judge of all the earth not do justice?'
\v 26 And Yahweh said, 'If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the middle of the city, then have I borne with all the place for their sake.'
\v 27 And Abraham answereth and said, 'Lo, I pray you, I have willed to speak unto the Lord, and I — dust and ashes;
\v 28 peradventure there are lacking five of the fifty righteous — will You destroy for five the whole of the city?' and He said, 'I destroy it not, if I find there forty and five.'
\v 29 And he addeth again to speak unto Him and said, 'Peradventure there are found there forty?' and He said, 'I do it not, because of the forty.'
\v 30 And he said, 'Let it not be, I Pray you, displeasing to the Lord, and I speak: peradventure there are found there thirty?' and He said, 'I do it not, if I find there thirty.'
\v 31 And he said, 'Lo, I pray you, I have willed to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there are found there twenty?' and He said, 'I do not destroy it, because of the twenty.'
\v 32 And he said, 'Let it not be, I pray Thee, displeasing to the Lord, and I speak only this time: peradventure there are found there ten?' and He said, 'I do not destroy it, because of the ten.'
\v 33 And Yahweh went on, when He had finished speaking unto Abraham, and Abraham had turned back to his place.
\c 19
\v 1 And two of the messengers come towards Sodom at even, and Lot is sitting at the gate of Sodom, and Lot saw, and riseth to meet them, and boweth himself — face to the earth,
\v 2 and he said, 'Lo, I pray you, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, unto the house of your servant, and lodge, and wash your feet — then you have risen early and gone on your way;' and they say, 'Nay, but in the broad place we do lodge.'
\v 3 And he presseth on them greatly, and they turn aside unto him, and come in unto his house; and he made for them a banquet, and had baked unleavened things; and they do eat.
\v 4 Before they lie down, the men of the city — men of Sodom — have come round about against the house, from young even unto aged, all the people from the extremity;
\v 5 and they call unto Lot and say to him, 'Where are the men who have come in unto you to-night? bring them out unto us, and we know them.'
\v 6 And Lot went out unto them, to the opening, and the door had shut behind him,
\v 7 and said, 'Do not, I pray you, my brethren, do evil;
\v 8 behold, I pray you, I have two daughters, who have not known any one; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do to them as is good in your eyes; only to these men do not anything, for therefore have they come in within the shadow of my roof.'
\v 9 And they say, 'Come nigh hither;' they say also, 'This one had come in to sojourn, and he certainly judgeth! now, we do evil to you more than to them;' and they press against the man, against Lot greatly, and come nigh to break the door.
\v 10 And the men put forth their hand, and bring in Lot unto them, into the house, and have shut the door;
\v 11 and the men who are at the opening of the house they have smitten with blindness, from small even unto great, and they weary themselves to find the opening.
\v 12 And the men say unto Lot, 'Whom hast you here still? son-in-law, your sons also, and your daughters, and all whom you hast in the city, bring out from this place;
\v 13 for we are destroying this place, for their cry had been great before the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh did send us to destroy it.'
\v 14 And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons-in-law, those taking his daughters, and said, 'Rise, go out from this place, for Yahweh is destroying the city;' and he is as one mocking in the eyes of his sons-in-law.
\v 15 And when the dawn had ascended, then the messengers press upon Lot, saying, 'Rise, take your wife, and your two daughters who are found present, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.'
\v 16 And he lingereth, and the men lay hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, through the mercy of Yahweh unto him, and they bring him out, and cause him to rest without the city.
\v 17 And it came to pass when he had brought them out without, that he said, 'Escape for your life; look not expectingly behind you, nor stand you in all the circuit; to the mountain escape, lest you be consumed.'
\v 18 And Lot said unto them, 'Not so, I pray you, my lord;
\v 19 behold, I pray you, your servant had found grace in yours eyes, and you will make great your kindness which you hast done with me by saving my life, and I am unable to escape to the mountain, lest the evil cleave to me, and I have died;
\v 20 behold, I pray you, this city is near to flee thither, and it is little; let me escape, I pray you, thither, (is it not little?) and my soul did live.'
\v 21 And he said unto him, 'Lo, I have accepted your face also for this thing, without overthrowing the city for which you hast spoken;
\v 22 haste, escape thither, for I am not able to do anything till yours entering thither;' therefore had he called the name of the city Zoar.
\v 23 The sun had gone out on the earth, and Lot had entered into Zoar,
\v 24 and Yahweh had rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh, from the heavens;
\v 25 and He overthroweth these cities, and all the circuit, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which is shooting up from the ground.
\v 26 And his wife looketh expectingly from behind him, and she is — a pillar of salt!
\v 27 And Abraham riseth early in the morning, unto the place where he had stood before the face of Yahweh;
\v 28 and he looketh on the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on all the face of the land of the circuit, and saw, and behold, the smoke of the land went up as smoke of the furnace.
\v 29 And it came to pass, in God's destroying the cities of the circuit, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow in the overthrowing of the cities in which Lot dwelt.
\v 30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelleth in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he had been afraid of dwelling in Zoar, and he dwelleth in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\v 31 And the first-born said unto the younger, 'Our father is old, and a man there is not in the earth to come in unto us, as is the way of all the earth;
\v 32 come, we cause our father to drink wine, and lie with him, and preserve from our father — a seed.'
\v 33 And they cause their father to drink wine on that night; and the first-born went in, and lieth with her father, and he had not known in her lying down, or in her rising up.
\v 34 And it came to pass, on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, 'Lo, I have lain yesterday-night with my father: we cause him to drink wine also to-night, and go you in, lie with him, and we preserve from our father — a seed.'
\v 35 And they cause their father to drink wine on that night also, and the younger riseth and lieth with him, and he had not known in her lying down, or in her rising up.
\v 36 And the two daughters of Lot conceive from their father,
\v 37 and the first-born beareth a son, and called his name Moab; he is father of Moab unto this day;
\v 38 as to the younger, she also had born a son, and called his name Ben-Ammi: he is father of the Beni-Ammon unto this day.
\c 20
\v 1 And Abraham journeyeth from there toward the land of the south, and dwelleth between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourneth in Gerar;
\v 2 and Abraham said concerning Sarah his wife, 'She is my sister;' and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
\v 3 And God came in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, 'Lo, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you hast taken — and she married to a husband.'
\v 4 And Abimelech had not drawn near unto her, and he said, 'Lord, also a righteous nation will you slay?
\v 5 had not he himself said to me, She is my sister! and she, even she herself, said, He is my brother; in the integrity of my heart, and in the innocency of my hands, I have done this.'
\v 6 And God said unto him in the dream, 'Yea, I — I have known that in the integrity of your heart you hast done this, and I withhold you, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore I have not suffered you to come against her;
\v 7 and now send back the man's wife, for he is inspired, and he did pray for you, and live you; and if you do not send back, know that dying you will die, you, and all that you hast.'
\v 8 And Abimelech riseth early in the morning, and called for all his servants, and spoke all these words in their ears; and the men fear exceedingly;
\v 9 and Abimelech called for Abraham, and said to him, 'What hast you done to us? and what have I sinned against you, that you hast brought upon me, and upon my kingdom, a great sin? works which are not done you hast done with me.'
\v 10 Abimelech also said unto Abraham, 'What hast you seen that you hast done this thing?'
\v 11 And Abraham said, 'Because I said, 'Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they have killed me for the sake of my wife;
\v 12 and also, truly she is my sister, daughter of my father, only not daughter of my mother, and she became my wife;
\v 13 and it came to pass, when God had caused me to wander from my father's house, that I say to her, This is your kindness which you will with me: at every place where we come, say of me, He is my brother.'
\v 14 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham, and sent back to him Sarah his wife;
\v 15 and Abimelech said, 'Lo, my land is before you, where it is good in yours eyes, dwell;'
\v 16 and to Sarah he had said, 'Lo, I have given a thousand silverlings to your brother; behold, it is to you a covering of eyes, to all who are with you;' and by all this she is reasoned with.
\v 17 And Abraham prayeth unto God, and God healeth Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:
\v 18 for Yahweh restraining had restrained every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
\c 21
\v 1 And Yahweh had looked after Sarah as He had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as He had spoken;
\v 2 and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God had spoken of with him;
\v 3 and Abraham called the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah had born to him — Isaac;
\v 4 and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son, being a son of eight days, as God had commanded him.
\v 5 And Abraham is a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him,
\v 6 and Sarah said, 'God had made laughter for me; every one who is hearing laugheth for me.'
\v 7 She said also, 'Who had said to Abraham, Sarah had suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'
\v 8 And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham made a great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;
\v 9 and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking,
\v 10 and she said to Abraham, 'Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid had no possession with my son — with Isaac.'
\v 11 And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son's sake;
\v 12 and God said unto Abraham, 'Let it not be wrong in yours eyes because of the youth, and because of your handmaid: all that Sarah said unto you — hearken to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to you.
\v 13 As to the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he is your seed.'
\v 14 And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave unto Hagar (placing it on her shoulder), also the lad, and sent her out; and she went on, and went astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;
\v 15 and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth the lad under one of the shrubs.
\v 16 And she went and sitteth by herself over-against, afar off, about a bow-shot, for she said, 'Let me not look on the death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up her voice, and weepeth.
\v 17 And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God called unto Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, 'What to you, Hagar? fear not; for God had hearkened unto the voice of the youth where he is;
\v 18 rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with your hand, for for a great nation I set him.'
\v 19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water, and she went and filleth the bottle with water, and caused the youth to drink;
\v 20 and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in the wilderness, and is an archer;
\v 21 and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt.
\v 22 And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech spoke — Phichol also, head of his host — unto Abraham, saying, 'God is with you in all that you are doing;
\v 23 and now, swear to me by God here: you will not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with you you will with me, and with the land in which you hast sojourned.'
\v 24 And Abraham said, 'I — I do swear.'
\v 25 And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away,
\v 26 and Abimelech said, 'I have not known who had done this thing, and even you did not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard save to-day.'
\v 27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;
\v 28 and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves.
\v 29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, 'What are they — these seven lambs which you hast set by themselves?'
\v 30 And he said, 'For — the seven lambs you will accept from my hand, so that it became a witness for me that I have digged this well;'
\v 31 therefore had he called that place 'Beer-Sheba,' for there have both of them sworn.
\v 32 And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech riseth — Phichol also, head of his host — and they turn back unto the land of the Philistines;
\v 33 and Abraham planted a tamarisk in Beer-Sheba, and preacheth there in the name of Yahweh, God age-during;
\v 34 and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days.
\c 22
\v 1 And it came to pass after these things that God had tried Abraham, and said unto him, 'Abraham;' and he said, 'Here am I.'
\v 2 And He said, 'Take, I pray you, your son, yours only one, whom you hast loved, even Isaac, and go for thyself unto the land of Moriah, and cause him to ascend there for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I speak unto you.'
\v 3 And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and he cleaveth the wood of the burnt-offering, and riseth and went unto the place of which God had spoken to him.
\v 4 On the third day — Abraham lifteth up his eyes, and saw the place from afar;
\v 5 and Abraham said unto his young men, 'Remain by yourselves here with the ass, and I and the youth go yonder and worship, and turn back unto you.'
\v 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and placeth on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire, and the knife; and they go on both of them together.
\v 7 And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, 'My father,' and he said, 'Here am I, my son.' And he said, 'Lo, the fire and the wood, and where the lamb for a burnt-offering?'
\v 8 and Abraham said, 'God did provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son;' and they go on both of them together.
\v 9 And they come in unto the place of which God had spoken to him, and there Abraham built the altar, and arrangeth the wood, and bindeth Isaac his son, and placeth him upon the altar above the wood;
\v 10 and Abraham putteth forth his hand, and took the knife — to slaughter his son.
\v 11 And the messenger of Yahweh called unto him from the heavens, and said, 'Abraham, Abraham;' and he said, 'Here am I;'
\v 12 and He said, 'Put not forth yours hand unto the youth, nor do anything to him, for now I have known that you are fearing God, and hast not withheld your son, yours only one, from Me.'
\v 13 And Abraham lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and behold, a ram behind, seized in a thicket by its horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and caused it to ascend for a burnt-offering instead of his son;
\v 14 and Abraham called the name of that place 'Yahweh-Jireh,' because it is said this day in the mount, 'Yahweh did provide.'
\v 15 And the messenger of Yahweh called unto Abraham a second time from the heavens,
\v 16 and said, 'By Myself I have sworn — the affirmation of Yahweh — that because you hast done this thing, and hast not withheld your son, yours only one — 
\v 17 that blessing I bless you, and multiplying I multiply your seed as stars of the heavens, and as sand which is on the sea-shore; and your seed did possess the gate of his enemies;
\v 18 and blessed themselves in your seed have all nations of the earth, because that you hast hearkened to My voice.'
\v 19 And Abraham turneth back unto his young men, and they rise and go together unto Beer-Sheba; and Abraham dwelleth in Beer-Sheba.
\v 20 And it came to pass after these things that it is declared to Abraham, saying, 'Lo, Milcah had borne, even she, sons to Nahor your brother:
\v 21 Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother; and Kemuel father of Aram,
\v 22 and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel;
\v 23 and Bethuel had begotten Rebekah;' these eight had Milcah borne to Nahor, Abraham's brother;
\v 24 and his concubine, whose name is Reumah, she also had borne Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maachah.
\c 23
\v 1 And the life of Sarah is a hundred and twenty and seven years — years of the life of Sarah;
\v 2 and Sarah dieth in Kirjath-Arba, which is Hebron, in the land of Caanan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah, and to bewail her.
\v 3 And Abraham riseth up from the presence of his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,
\v 4 A sojourner and a settler I am with you; give to me a possession of a burying-place with you, and I bury my dead from before me.'
\v 5 And the sons of Heth answer Abraham, saying to him,
\v 6 Hear us, my lord; a prince of God are you in our middle; in the choice of our burying-places bury your dead: none of us his burying-place did withhold from you, from burying your dead.'
\v 7 And Abraham riseth and boweth himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,
\v 8 and he spoke with them, saying, 'If it is your desire to bury my dead from before me, hear me, and meet for me with Ephron, son of Zoar;
\v 9 and he gave to me the cave of Machpelah, which he had, which is in the extremity of his field; for full money did he give it to me, in your middle, for a possession of a burying-place.'
\v 10 And Ephron is sitting in the middle of the sons of Heth, and Ephron the Hittite answereth Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all those entering the gate of his city, saying,
\v 11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, to you I have given it; before the eyes of the sons of my people I have given it to you — bury your dead.'
\v 12 And Abraham boweth himself before the people of the land,
\v 13 and spoke unto Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, 'Only — if you wouldest hear me — I have given the money of the field — accept from me, and I bury my dead there.'
\v 14 And Ephron answereth Abraham, saying to him,
\v 15 My lord, hear me: the land — four hundred shekels of silver; between me and you, what is it? — your dead bury.'
\v 16 And Abraham hearkeneth unto Ephron, and Abraham weigheth to Ephron the silver which he had spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred silver shekels, passing with the merchant.
\v 17 And established are the field of Ephron, which is in Machpelah, which is before Mamre, the field and the cave which is in it, and all the trees which are in the field, which are in all its border round about,
\v 18 to Abraham by purchase, before the eyes of the sons of Heth, among all entering the gate of his city.
\v 19 And after this had Abraham buried Sarah his wife at the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (which is Hebron), in the land of Canaan;
\v 20 and established are the field, and the cave which is in it, to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, from the sons of Heth.
\c 24
\v 1 And Abraham is old, he had entered into days, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things;
\v 2 and Abraham said unto his servant, the eldest of his house, who is ruling over all that he had, 'Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh,
\v 3 and I cause you to swear by Yahweh, God of the heavens, and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in the middle of whom I am dwelling;
\v 4 but unto my land and unto my kindred will you go, and hast taken a wife for my son, for Isaac.'
\v 5 And the servant said unto him, 'It may be the woman is not willing to come after me unto this land; do I at all cause your son to turn back unto the land from whence you camest out?'
\v 6 And Abraham said unto him, 'Take heed to thyself, lest you cause my son to turn back thither;
\v 7 Yahweh, God of the heavens, who had taken me from the house of my father, and from the land of my birth, and who had spoken to me, and who had sworn to me, saying, To your seed I give this land, He did send His messenger before you, and you hast taken a wife for my son from there;
\v 8 and if the woman be not willing to come after you, then you hast been acquitted from this mine oath: only my son you will not cause to turn back thither.'
\v 9 And the servant putteth his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and sweareth to him concerning this matter.
\v 10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his lord and went, also of all the goods of his lord in his hand, and he riseth, and went unto Aram-Naharaim, unto the city of Nahor;
\v 11 and he caused the camels to kneel at the outside of the city, at the well of water, at even-time, at the time of the coming out of the women who draw water.
\v 12 And he said, 'Yahweh, God of my lord Abraham, cause to meet, I pray Thee, before me this day — (and do kindness with my lord Abraham;
\v 13 behold, I am standing by the fountain of water, and daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;
\v 14 and it had been, the young person unto whom I say, Incline, I pray you, your pitcher, and I drink, and she had said, Drink, and I water also your camels) — her You hast decided for Your servant, for Isaac; and by it I know that You hast done kindness with my lord.'
\v 15 And it came to pass, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham) is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder,
\v 16 and the young person is of very good appearance, a virgin, and a man had not known her; and she went down to the fountain, and filleth her pitcher, and came up.
\v 17 And the servant runneth to meet her, and said, 'Let me swallow, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher;'
\v 18 and she said, 'Drink, my lord;' and she hasteth, and letteth down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
\v 19 And she finisheth giving him drink, and said, 'Also for your camels I draw till they have finished drinking;'
\v 20 and she hasteth, and emptieth her pitcher into the drinking-trough, and runneth again unto the well to draw, and draweth for all his camels.
\v 21 And the man, wondering at her, remaineth silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his way prosperous or not.
\v 22 And it came to pass when the camels have finished drinking, that the man took a golden ring (whose weight is a bekah), and two bracelets for her hands (whose weight is ten bekahs of gold),
\v 23 and said, 'Whose daughter are you? declare to me, I pray you, is the house of your father a place for us to lodge in?'
\v 24 And she said unto him, 'I am daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she had borne to Nahor.'
\v 25 She said also unto him, 'Both straw and provender are abundant with us, also a place to lodge in.'
\v 26 And the man boweth, and did obeisance to Yahweh,
\v 27 and said, 'Blessed is Yahweh, God of my lord Abraham, who had not left off His kindness and His truth with my lord; — I being in the way, Yahweh had led me to the house of my lord's brethren.'
\v 28 And the young person runneth, and declareth to the house of her mother according to these words.
\v 29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name is Laban, and Laban runneth unto the man who is without, unto the fountain;
\v 30 yea, it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heareth the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, 'Thus had the man spoken unto me,' that he came in unto the man, and behold, he is standing by the camels by the fountain.
\v 31 And he said, 'Come in, O blessed one of Yahweh, why standest you without, and I — I have prepared the house and place for the camels!'
\v 32 And he brought in the man into the house, and looseth the camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who are with him:
\v 33 and setteth before him to eat; but he said, 'I do not eat till I have spoken my word;' and he said, 'Speak.'
\v 34 And he said, 'I am Abraham's servant;
\v 35 and Yahweh had blessed my lord exceedingly, and he is great; and He gave to him flock, and herd, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses;
\v 36 and Sarah, my lord's wife, beareth a son to my lord, after she had been aged, and he gave to him all that he had.
\v 37 'And my lord caused me to swear, saying, You will not take a wife to my son from the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I am dwelling.
\v 38 If not — unto the house of my father you will go, and unto my family, and you hast taken a wife for my son.
\v 39 'And I say unto my lord, It may be the woman did not come after me;
\v 40 and he said unto me, Yahweh, before whom I have walked habitually, did send His messenger with you, and had prospered your way, and you hast taken a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father;
\v 41 then are you acquitted from my oath, when you comest unto my family, and if they give not one to you; then you hast been acquitted from my oath.
\v 42 And I come to-day unto the fountain, and I say, Yahweh, God of my lord Abraham, if You are, I pray Thee, making prosperous my way in which I am going — 
\v 43 (behold, I am standing by the fountain of water), then the virgin who is coming out to draw, and I have said unto her, Let me drink, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher,
\v 44 and she had said unto me, Both drink you, and also for your camels I draw — she is the woman whom Yahweh had decided for my lord's son.
\v 45 'Before I finish speaking unto my heart, then behold, Rebekah is coming out, and her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down to the fountain, and draweth; and I say unto her, Let me drink, I pray you,
\v 46 and she hasteth and letteth down her pitcher from off her and said, Drink, and your camels also I water; and I drink, and the camels also she had watered.
\v 47 And I ask her, and say, Whose daughter are you? and she said, Daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah had borne to him, and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands,
\v 48 and I bow, and do obeisance before Yahweh, and I bless Yahweh, God of my lord Abraham, who had led me in the true way to receive the daughter of my lord's brother for his son.
\v 49 'And now, if you are dealing kindly and truly with my lord, declare to me; and if not, declare to me; and I turn unto the right or unto the left.'
\v 50 And Laban answereth — Bethuel also — and they say, 'The thing had gone out from Yahweh; we are not able to speak unto you bad or good;
\v 51 behold, Rebekah is before you, take and go, and she is a wife to your lord's son, as Yahweh had spoken.'
\v 52 And it came to pass, when the servant of Abraham had heard their words, that he boweth himself towards the earth before Yahweh;
\v 53 and the servant took out vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and gave to Rebekah; precious things also he had given to her brother and to her mother.
\v 54 And they eat and drink, he and the men who are with him, and lodge all night; and they rise in the morning, and he said, 'Send me to my lord;'
\v 55 and her brother said — her mother also — 'Let the young person abide with us a week or ten days, afterwards did she go.'
\v 56 And he said unto them, 'Do not delay me, seeing Yahweh had prospered my way; send me away, and I go to my lord;'
\v 57 and they say, 'Let us call for the young person, and ask at her mouth;'
\v 58 and they call for Rebekah, and say unto her, 'Dost you go with this man?' and she said, 'I go.'
\v 59 And they send away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men;
\v 60 and they bless Rebekah, and say to her, 'You are our sister; become you thousands of myriads, and your seed did possess the gate of those hating it.'
\v 61 And Rebekah and her young women arise, and ride on the camels, and go after the man; and the servant took Rebekah and went.
\v 62 And Isaac had come in from the entrance of the Well of the Living One, my Beholder; and he is dwelling in the land of the south,
\v 63 and Isaac went out to meditate in the field, at the turning of the evening, and he lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and behold, camels are coming.
\v 64 And Rebekah lifteth up her eyes, and saw Isaac, and alighteth from off the camel;
\v 65 and she said unto the servant, 'Who is this man who is walking in the field to meet us?' and the servant said, 'It is my lord;' and she took the veil, and covereth herself.
\v 66 And the servant recounteth to Isaac all the things that he had done,
\v 67 and Isaac brought her in unto the tent of Sarah his mother, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loveth her, and Isaac is comforted after the death of his mother.
\c 25
\v 1 And Abraham addeth and took a wife, and her name is Keturah;
\v 2 and she beareth to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\v 3 And Jokshan had begotten Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim;
\v 4 and the sons of Midian are Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah: all these are sons of Keturah.
\v 5 And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac;
\v 6 and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham had, Abraham had given gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (in his being yet alive) eastward, unto the east country.
\v 7 And these are the days of the years of the life of Abraham, which he lived, a hundred and seventy and five years;
\v 8 and Abraham expireth, and dieth in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and is gathered unto his people.
\v 9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons bury him at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron, son of Zoar the Hittite, which is before Mamre — 
\v 10 the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth — there had Abraham been buried, and Sarah his wife.
\v 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelleth by the Well of the Living One, my Beholder.
\v 12 And these are births of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, had borne to Abraham;
\v 13 and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their births: first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\v 14 and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\v 15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
\v 16 these are sons of Ishmael, and these their names, by their villages, and by their towers; twelve princes according to their peoples.
\v 17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people;
\v 18 and they tabernacle from Havilah unto Shur, which is before Egypt, in your going towards Asshur; in the presence of all his brethren had he fallen.
\v 19 And these are births of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham had begotten Isaac;
\v 20 and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean, from Padan-Aram, sister of Laban the Aramaean, to him for a wife.
\v 21 And Isaac made entreaty to Yahweh before his wife, for she is barren: and Yahweh is entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiveth,
\v 22 and the children struggle together within her, and she said, 'If it is right — why am I thus?' and she went to seek Yahweh.
\v 23 And Yahweh said to her, 'Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from your bowels are parted; and the one people than the other people is stronger; and the elder did serve the younger.'
\v 24 And her days to bear are fulfilled, and behold, twins are in her womb;
\v 25 and the first came out all red as a hairy robe, and they call his name Esau;
\v 26 and afterwards had his brother come out, and his hand is taking hold on Esau's heel, and one called his name Jacob; and Isaac is a son of sixty years in her bearing them.
\v 27 And the youths grew, and Esau is a man acquainted with hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob is a plain man, inhabiting tents;
\v 28 and Isaac loveth Esau, for his hunting is in his mouth; and Rebekah is loving Jacob.
\v 29 And Jacob boileth pottage, and Esau came in from the field, and he is weary;
\v 30 and Esau said unto Jacob, 'Let me eat, I pray you, some of this red red thing, for I am weary;' therefore had one called his name Edom Red;
\v 31 and Jacob said, 'Sell to-day your birthright to me.'
\v 32 And Esau said, 'Lo, I am going to die, and what is this to me — birthright?'
\v 33 and Jacob said, 'Swear to me to-day:' and he sweareth to him, and selleth his birthright to Jacob;
\v 34 and Jacob had given to Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and he eateth, and drinketh, and riseth, and went; and Esau despiseth the birthright.
\c 26
\v 1 And there is a famine in the land, besides the first famine which was in the days of Abraham, and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
\v 2 And Yahweh appeareth unto him, and said, 'Go not down towards Egypt, tabernacle in the land concerning which I speak unto you,
\v 3 sojourn in this land, and I am with you, and bless you, for to you and to your seed I give all these lands, and I have established the oath which I have sworn to Abraham your father;
\v 4 and I have multiplied your seed as stars of the heavens, and I have given to your seed all these lands; and blessed themselves in your seed have all nations of the earth;
\v 5 because that Abraham had hearkened to My voice, and keepeth My charge, My commands, My statutes, and My laws.'
\v 6 And Isaac dwelleth in Gerar;
\v 7 and men of the place ask him of his wife, and he said, 'She is my sister:' for he had been afraid to say, 'My wife — lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, for she is of good appearance.'
\v 8 And it came to pass, when the days have been prolonged to him there, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looketh through the window, and saw, and behold, Isaac is playing with Rebekah his wife.
\v 9 And Abimelech called for Isaac, and said, 'Lo, she is surely your wife; and how hast you said, She is my sister?' and Isaac said unto him, 'Because I said, Lest I die for her.'
\v 10 And Abimelech said, 'What is this you hast done to us? as a little thing one of the people had lain with your wife, and you hadst brought upon us guilt;'
\v 11 and Abimelech commandeth all the people, saying, 'He who came against this man or against his wife, dying did die.'
\v 12 And Isaac soweth in that land, and finds in that year a hundredfold, and Yahweh blessed him;
\v 13 and the man is great, and went on, going on and becoming great, till that he had been very great,
\v 14 and he had possession of a flock, and possession of a herd, and an abundant service; and the Philistines envy him,
\v 15 and all the wells which his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines have stopped them, and fill them with dust.
\v 16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, 'Go from us; for you hast become much mightier than we;'
\v 17 and Isaac went from there, and encampeth in the valley of Gerar, and dwelleth there;
\v 18 and Isaac turneth back, and diggeth the wells of water which they digged in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines do stop after the death of Abraham, and he called to them names according to the names which his father called them.
\v 19 And Isaac's servants dig in the valley, and find there a well of living water,
\v 20 and shepherds of Gerar strive with shepherds of Isaac, saying, 'The water is ours;' and he called the name of the well 'Strife,' because they have striven habitually with him;
\v 21 and they dig another well, and they strive also for it, and he called its name 'Hatred.'
\v 22 And he removeth from there, and diggeth another well, and they have not striven for it, and he called its name Enlargements, and said, 'For — now had Yahweh given enlargement to us, and we have been fruitful in the land.'
\v 23 And he went up from there to Beer-Sheba,
\v 24 and Yahweh appeareth unto him during that night, and said, 'I am the God of Abraham your father, fear not, for I am with you, and have blessed you, and have multiplied your seed, because of Abraham My servant;'
\v 25 and he built there an altar, and preacheth in the name of Yahweh, and stretcheth out there his tent, and there Isaac's servants dig a well.
\v 26 And Abimelech had gone unto him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phichol head of his host;
\v 27 and Isaac said unto them, 'Wherefore have you come unto me, and you have hated me, and you send me away from you?'
\v 28 And they say, 'We have certainly seen that Yahweh had been with you, and we say, 'Let there be, we pray you, an oath between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;
\v 29 do not evil with us, as we have not touched you, and as we have only done good with you, and send you away in peace; you are now blessed of Yahweh.'
\v 30 And he made for them a banquet, and they eat and drink,
\v 31 and rise early in the morning, and swear one to another, and Isaac sent them away, and they go from him in peace.
\v 32 And it came to pass during that day that Isaac's servants come and declare to him concerning the circumstances of the well which they have digged, and say to him, 'We have found water;'
\v 33 and he called it Shebah, oath, therefore the name of the city is Beer-Sheba, well of the oath, unto this day.
\v 34 And Esau is a son of forty years, and he took a wife, Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite,
\v 35 and they are a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.
\c 27
\v 1 And it came to pass that Isaac is aged, and his eyes are too dim for seeing, and he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, 'My son;' and he said unto him, 'Here am I.'
\v 2 And he said, 'Lo, I pray you, I have become aged, I have not known the day of my death;
\v 3 and now, take up, I pray you, your instruments, your quiver, and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt for me provision,
\v 4 and make for me tasteful things, such as I have loved, and bring in to me, and I do eat, so that my soul did bless you before I die.'
\v 5 And Rebekah is hearkening while Isaac is speaking unto Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt provision — to bring in;
\v 6 and Rebekah had spoken unto Jacob her son, saying, 'Lo, I have heard your father speaking unto Esau your brother, saying,
\v 7 Bring for me provision, and make for me tasteful things, and I do eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.
\v 8 'And now, my son, hearken to my voice, to that which I am commanding you:
\v 9 Go, I pray you, unto the flock, and take for me from there two good kids of the goats, and I make them tasteful things for your father, such as he had loved;
\v 10 and you hast taken in to your father, and he had eaten, so that his soul did bless you before his death.
\v 11 And Jacob said unto Rebekah his mother, 'Lo, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I a smooth man,
\v 12 it may be my father did feel me, and I have been in his eyes as a deceiver, and have brought upon me disesteem, and not a blessing;'
\v 13 and his mother said to him, 'On me your disesteem, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go, take for me.'
\v 14 And he went, and took, and brought to his mother, and his mother made tasteful things, such as his father had loved;
\v 15 and Rebekah took the desirable garments of Esau her elder son, which are with her in the house, and did put on Jacob her younger son;
\v 16 and the skins of the kids of the goats she had put on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck,
\v 17 and she gave the tasteful things, and the bread which she had made, into the hand of Jacob her son.
\v 18 And he came in unto his father, and said, 'My father;' and he said, 'Here am I; who are you, my son?'
\v 19 And Jacob said unto his father, 'I am Esau your first-born; I have done as you hast spoken unto me; rise, I pray you, sit, and eat of my provision, so that your soul did bless me.'
\v 20 And Isaac said unto his son, 'What is this you hast hasted to find, my son?' and he said, 'That which Yahweh your God had caused to come before me.'
\v 21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, 'Come nigh, I pray you, and I feel you, my son, whether you are he, my son Esau, or not.'
\v 22 And Jacob came nigh unto Isaac his father, and he feeleth him, and said, 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, and the hands hands of Esau.'
\v 23 And he had not discerned him, for his hands have been hairy, as the hands of Esau his brother, and he blessed him,
\v 24 and said, 'You are he — my son Esau?' and he said, 'I am.'
\v 25 And he said, 'Bring nigh to me, and I do eat of my son's provision, so that my soul did bless you;' and he brought nigh to him, and he eateth; and he brought to him wine, and he drinketh.
\v 26 And Isaac his father said to him, 'Come nigh, I pray you, and kiss me, my son;'
\v 27 and he came nigh, and kisseth him, and he smelled the fragrance of his garments, and blessed him, and said, 'See, the fragrance of my son is as the fragrance of a field which Yahweh had blessed;
\v 28 and God did give to you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of corn and wine;
\v 29 peoples serve you, and nations bow themselves to you, be you mighty over your brethren, and the sons of your mother bow themselves to you; those who curse you are cursed, and those who bless you are blessed.'
\v 30 And it came to pass, as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob is only just going out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother had come in from his hunting;
\v 31 and he also made tasteful things, and brought to his father, and said to his father, 'Let my father arise, and eat of his son's provision, so that your soul did bless me.'
\v 32 And Isaac his father said to him, 'Who are you?' and he said, 'I am your son, your first-born, Esau;'
\v 33 and Isaac trembleth a very great trembling, and said, 'Who, now, is he who had provided provision, and brought in to me, and I eat of all before you comest in, and I bless him? — yea, blessed is he.'
\v 34 When Esau heareth the words of his father, then he crieth a very great and bitter cry, and said to his father, 'Bless me, me also, O my father;'
\v 35 and he said, 'Your brother had come with subtilty, and took your blessing.'
\v 36 And he said, 'Is it because one called his name Jacob that he did take me by the heel these two times? my birthright he had taken; and behold, now, he had taken my blessing;' he said also, 'Hast you not kept back a blessing for me?'
\v 37 And Isaac answereth and said to Esau, 'Lo, a mighty one have I set him over you, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants, and with corn and wine have I sustained him; and for you now, what shall I do, my son?'
\v 38 And Esau said unto his father, 'One blessing hast you my father? bless me, me also, O my father;' and Esau lifteth up his voice, and weepeth.
\v 39 And Isaac his father answereth and said unto him, 'Lo, of the fatness of the earth is your dwelling, and of the dew of the heavens from above;
\v 40 and by your sword will you live, and your brother will you serve; and it had come to pass when you rulest, that you hast broken his yoke from off your neck.'
\v 41 And Esau hateth Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, 'The days of mourning for my father draw near, and I slay Jacob my brother.'
\v 42 And the words of Esau her elder son are declared to Rebekah, and she sent and called for Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, 'Lo, Esau your brother is comforting himself in regard to you — to slay you;
\v 43 and now, my son, hearken to my voice, and rise, flee for thyself unto Laban my brother, to Haran,
\v 44 and you hast dwelt with him some days, till your brother's fury turn back,
\v 45 till your brother's anger turn back from you, and he had forgotten that which you hast done to him, and I have sent and taken you from there; why am I bereaved even of you both the same day?'
\v 46 And Rebekah said unto Isaac, 'I have been disgusted with my life because of the presence of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these — from the daughters of the land — why do I live?'
\c 28
\v 1 And Isaac called unto Jacob, and blessed him, and commandeth him, and said to him, 'You will not take a wife of the daughters of Caanan;
\v 2 rise, go to Padan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and take for thyself from there a wife, of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother;
\v 3 and God Almighty did bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and you hast become an assembly of peoples;
\v 4 and He did give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, to cause you to possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.'
\v 5 And Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Padan-Aram, unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau.
\v 6 And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and had sent him to Padan-Aram to take to himself from there a wife — in his blessing him that he laid a charge upon him, saying, You will not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan — 
\v 7 that Jacob hearkeneth unto his father and unto his mother, and went to Padan-Aram — 
\v 8 and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan are evil in the eyes of Isaac his father,
\v 9 and Esau went unto Ishmael, and took Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, sister of Nebajoth, unto his wives, to himself, for a wife.
\v 10 And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheba, and went toward Haran,
\v 11 and he toucheth at a certain place, and lodgeth there, for the sun had gone in, and he took of the stones of the place, and made them his pillows, and lieth down in that place.
\v 12 And he dreameth, and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and its head is touching the heavens; and behold, messengers of God are going up and coming down by it;
\v 13 and behold, Yahweh is standing upon it, and He said, 'I am Yahweh, God of Abraham your father, and God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying, to you I give it, and to your seed;
\v 14 and your seed had been as the dust of the land, and you hast broken forth westward, and eastward, and northward, and southward, and all families of the ground have been blessed in you and in your seed.
\v 15 And behold, I am with you, and have kept you wheresoever you goest, and have caused you to turn back unto this ground; for I leave you not till that I have surely done that which I have spoken to you.'
\v 16 And Jacob awaketh out of his sleep, and said, 'Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I knew not;'
\v 17 and he feareth, and said, 'How fearful is this place; this is nothing but a house of God, and this a gate of the heavens.'
\v 18 And Jacob riseth early in the morning, and took the stone which he had made his pillows, and made it a standing pillar, and poureth oil upon its top,
\v 19 and he called the name of that place Bethel, house of God, and yet, Luz is the name of the city at the first.
\v 20 And Jacob voweth a vow, saying, 'Seeing God is with me, and had kept me in this way which I am going, and had given to me bread to eat, and a garment to put on — 
\v 21 when I have turned back in peace unto the house of my father, and Yahweh had become my God,
\v 22 then this stone which I have made a standing pillar is a house of God, and all that You will give to me — tithing I tithe to Thee.'
\c 29
\v 1 And Jacob lifteth up his feet, and went towards the land of the sons of the east;
\v 2 and he looketh, and behold, a well in the field, and behold, there three droves of a flock crouching by it, for from that well they water the droves, and the great stone is on the mouth of the well.
\v 3 (When thither have all the droves been gathered, and they have rolled the stone from off the mouth of the well, and have watered the flock, then they have turned back the stone on the mouth of the well to its place.)
\v 4 And Jacob said to them, 'My brethren, from whence are you?' and they say, 'We are from Haran.'
\v 5 And he said to them, 'Have you known Laban, son of Nahor?' and they say, 'We have known.'
\v 6 And he said to them, 'Hath he peace?' and they say, 'Peace; and behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock.'
\v 7 And he said, 'Lo, the day is still great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered; water you the flock, and go, delight yourselves.'
\v 8 And they say, 'We are not able, till that all the droves be gathered together, and they have rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and we have watered the flock.'
\v 9 He is yet speaking with them, and Rachel had come with the flock which her father had, for she is shepherdess;
\v 10 and it came to pass when Jacob had seen Rachel, daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob came nigh and rolleth the stone from off the mouth of the well, and watereth the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
\v 11 And Jacob kisseth Rachel, and lifteth up his voice, and weepeth,
\v 12 and Jacob declareth to Rachel that he is her father's brother, and that he is Rebekah's son, and she runneth and declareth to her father.
\v 13 And it came to pass, when Laban heareth the report of Jacob his sister's son, that he runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and kisseth him, and brought him in unto his house; and he recounteth to Laban all these things,
\v 14 and Laban said to him, 'Only my bone and my flesh are you;' and he dwelleth with him a month of days.
\v 15 And Laban said to Jacob, 'Is it because you are my brother that you hast served me for nought? declare to me what is your hire.'
\v 16 And Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder is Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel,
\v 17 and the eyes of Leah are tender, and Rachel had been fair of form and fair of appearance.
\v 18 And Jacob loveth Rachel, and said, 'I serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter:'
\v 19 and Laban said, 'It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man; dwell with me;'
\v 20 and Jacob serveth for Rachel seven years; and they are in his eyes as some days, because of his loving her.
\v 21 And Jacob said unto Laban, 'Give up my wife, for my days have been fulfilled, and I go in unto her;'
\v 22 and Laban gathereth all the men of the place, and made a banquet.
\v 23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah, his daughter, and brought her in unto him, and he went in unto her;
\v 24 and Laban gave to her Zilpah, his maid-servant, to Leah his daughter, a maid-servant.
\v 25 And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it is Leah; and he said unto Laban, 'What is this you hast done to me? for Rachel have I not served with you? and why hast you deceived me?'
\v 26 And Laban said, 'It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the first-born;
\v 27 fulfil the week of this one, and we give to you also this one, for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.'
\v 28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilleth the week of this one, and he gave to him Rachel his daughter, to him for a wife;
\v 29 and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his maid-servant, for a maid-servant to her.
\v 30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he also loveth Rachel more than Leah; and he serveth with him yet seven other years.
\v 31 And Yahweh saw that Leah is the hated one, and He opened her womb, and Rachel is barren;
\v 32 and Leah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and called his name Reuben, for she said, 'Because Yahweh had looked on mine affliction; because now did my husband love me.'
\v 33 And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and said, 'Because Yahweh had heard that I am the hated one, He also gave to me even this one;' and she called his name Simeon.
\v 34 And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and said, 'Now is the time, my husband is joined unto me, because I have born to him three sons,' therefore had one called his name Levi.
\v 35 And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and said this time, 'I praise Yahweh;' therefore had she called his name Judah; and she ceaseth from bearing.
\c 30
\v 1 And Rachel saw that she had not borne to Jacob, and Rachel is envious of her sister, and said unto Jacob, 'Give me sons, and if there is none — I die.'
\v 2 And Jacob's anger burneth against Rachel, and he said, 'Am I in stead of God who had withheld from you the fruit of the womb?'
\v 3 And she said, 'Lo, my handmaid Bilhah, go in unto her, and she did bear on my knees, and I am built up, even I, from her;'
\v 4 and she gave to him Bilhah her maid-servant for a wife, and Jacob went in unto her;
\v 5 and Bilhah conceiveth, and beareth to Jacob a son,
\v 6 and Rachel said, 'God had decided for me, and also had hearkened to my voice, and gave to me a son;' therefore had she called his name Dan.
\v 7 And Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant, conceiveth again, and beareth a second son to Jacob,
\v 8 and Rachel said, 'With wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, yea, I have prevailed;' and she called his name Napthali.
\v 9 And Leah saw that she had ceased from bearing, and she took Zilpah her maid-servant, and gave her to Jacob for a wife;
\v 10 and Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant, beareth to Jacob a son,
\v 11 and Leah said, 'A troop is coming;' and she called his name Gad.
\v 12 And Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant, beareth a second son to Jacob,
\v 13 and Leah said, 'Because of my happiness, for daughters have pronounced me happy;' and she called his name Asher.
\v 14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat-harvest, and finds love-apples in the field, and brought them in unto Leah, his mother, and Rachel said unto Leah, 'Give to me, I pray you, of the love-apples of your son.'
\v 15 And she said to her, 'Is your taking my husband a little thing, that you hast taken also the love-apples of my son?' and Rachel said, 'Therefore did he lie with you to-night, for your son's love-apples.'
\v 16 And Jacob came in from the field at evening; and Leah went to meet him, and said, 'Unto me will you come in, for hiring I have hired you with my son's love-apples;' and he lieth with her during that night.
\v 17 And God hearkeneth unto Leah, and she conceiveth, and beareth to Jacob a son, a fifth,
\v 18 and Leah said, 'God had given my hire, because I have given my maid-servant to my husband;' and she called his name Issachar.
\v 19 And conceive again did Leah, and she beareth a sixth son to Jacob,
\v 20 and Leah said, 'God had endowed me — a good dowry; this time did my husband dwell with me, for I have borne to him six sons;' and she called his name Zebulun;
\v 21 and afterwards had she born a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
\v 22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkeneth unto her, and opened her womb,
\v 23 and she conceiveth and beareth a son, and said, 'God had gathered up my reproach;'
\v 24 and she called his name Joseph, saying, 'Yahweh is adding to me another son.'
\v 25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, 'Send me away, and I go unto my place, and to my land;
\v 26 give up my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and I go; for you — you hast known my service which I have served you.'
\v 27 And Laban said unto him, 'If, I pray you, I have found grace in yours eyes — I have observed diligently that Yahweh did bless me for your sake.'
\v 28 He said also, 'Define your hire to me, and I give.'
\v 29 And he said unto him, 'You — you hast known that which I have served you in, and that which your substance was with me;
\v 30 for it is little which you hast had at my appearance, and it breaketh forth into a multitude, and Yahweh blessed you at my coming; and now, when do I make, I also, for mine own house?'
\v 31 And he said, 'What do I give to you?' And Jacob said, 'You will not give me anything; if you do for me this thing, I turn back; I have delight; your flock I watch;
\v 32 I pass through all your flock to-day to turn aside from there every sheep speckled and spotted, and every brown sheep among the lambs, and speckled and spotted among the goats — and it had been my hire;
\v 33 and my righteousness had answered for me in the day to come, when it came in for my hire before your face; — every one which is not speckled and spotted among my goats, and brown among my lambs — it is stolen with me.'
\v 34 And Laban said, 'Lo, O that it were according to your word;'
\v 35 and he turneth aside during that day the ring-streaked and the spotted he-goats, and all the speckled and the spotted she-goats, every one that had white in it, and every brown one among the lambs, and he gave into the hand of his sons,
\v 36 and setteth a journey of three days between himself and Jacob; and Jacob is feeding the rest of the flock of Laban.
\v 37 And Jacob took to himself a rod of fresh poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut, and did peel in them white peelings, making bare the white that is on the rods,
\v 38 and setteth up the rods which he had peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs (when the flock came in to drink), over-against the flock, that they may conceive in their coming in to drink;
\v 39 and the flocks conceive at the rods, and the flock beareth ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted ones.
\v 40 And the lambs had Jacob parted, and he putteth the face of the flock towards the ring-streaked, also all the brown in the flock of Laban, and he setteth his own droves by themselves, and had not set them near Laban's flock.
\v 41 And it had come to pass whenever the strong ones of the flock conceive, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, to cause them to conceive by the rods,
\v 42 and when the flock is feeble, he did not set them; and the feeble ones have been Laban's, and the strong ones Jacob's.
\v 43 And the man increaseth very exceedingly, and had many flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.
\c 31
\v 1 And he heareth the words of Laban's sons, saying, 'Jacob had taken all that our father had; yea, from that which our father had, he had made all this honour;'
\v 2 and Jacob saw the face of Laban, and behold, it is not with him as heretofore.
\v 3 And Yahweh said unto Jacob, 'Turn back unto the land of your fathers, and to your kindred, and I am with you.'
\v 4 And Jacob sent and called for Rachel and for Leah to the field unto his flock;
\v 5 and said to them, 'I am beholding your father's face — that it is not towards me as heretofore, and the God of my father had been with me,
\v 6 and you — you have known that with all my power I have served your father,
\v 7 and your father had played upon me, and had changed my hire ten times; and God had not suffered him to do evil with me.
\v 8 'If he say thus: The speckled are your hire, then bare all the flock speckled ones; and if he say thus: The ring-streaked are your hire, then bare all the flock ring-streaked;
\v 9 and God took away the substance of your father, and did give to me.
\v 10 And it came to pass at the time of the flock conceiving, that I lift up mine eyes and see in a dream, and behold, the he-goats, which are going up on the flock, are ring-streaked, speckled, and grisled;
\v 11 and the messenger of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob, and I say, Here am I.
\v 12 And He said, Lift up, I pray you, yours eyes, and see — all the he-goats which are going up on the flock are ring-streaked, speckled, and grisled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you;
\v 13 I am the God of Bethel where you hast anointed a standing pillar, where you hast vowed a vow to me; now, arise, go out from this land, and turn back unto the land of your birth.'
\v 14 And Rachel answereth — Leah also — and said to him, 'Have we yet a portion and inheritance in the house of our father?
\v 15 have we not been reckoned strangers to him? for he had sold us, and he also utterly consumeth our money;
\v 16 for all the wealth which God had taken away from our father, it is ours, and our children's; and now, all that God had said unto you — do.'
\v 17 And Jacob riseth, and lifteth up his sons and his wives on the camels,
\v 18 and leadeth all his cattle, and all his substance which he had acquired, the cattle of his getting, which he had acquired in Padan-Aram, to go unto Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.
\v 19 And Laban had gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stealeth the teraphim which her father had;
\v 20 and Jacob deceiveth the heart of Laban the Aramaean, because he had not declared to him that he is fleeing;
\v 21 and he fleeth, he and all that he had, and riseth, and passeth over the River, and setteth his face toward the mount of Gilead.
\v 22 And it is told to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
\v 23 and he took his brethren with him, and pursueth after him a journey of seven days, and overtook him in the mount of Gilead.
\v 24 And God came in unto Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night, and said to him, 'Take heed to thyself lest you speak with Jacob from good unto evil.'
\v 25 And Laban overtook Jacob; and Jacob had fixed his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren have fixed theirs in the mount of Gilead.
\v 26 And Laban said to Jacob, 'What hast you done that you will deceive my heart, and lead away my daughters as captives of the sword?
\v 27 Why hast you hidden thyself to flee, and deceivest me, and hast not declared to me, and I send you away with joy and with songs, with tabret and with harp,
\v 28 and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? — now you hast acted foolishly in doing so;
\v 29 my hand is to God to do evil with you, but the God of your father yesternight had spoken unto me, saying, Take heed to thyself from speaking with Jacob from good unto evil.
\v 30 'And now, you hast certainly gone, because you hast been very desirous for the house of your father; why hast you stolen my gods?'
\v 31 And Jacob answereth and said to Laban, 'Because I was afraid, for I said, Lest you take violently away your daughters from me;
\v 32 with whomsoever you findest your gods — he did not live; before our brethren discern for thyself what is with me, and take to thyself:' and Jacob had not known that Rachel had stolen them.
\v 33 And Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two handmaidens, and had not found; and he went out from the tent of Leah, and went into the tent of Rachel.
\v 34 And Rachel had taken the teraphim, and putteth them in the furniture of the camel, and sitteth upon them; and Laban feeleth all the tent, and had not found;
\v 35 and she said unto her father, 'Let it not be displeasing in the eyes of my lord that I am not able to rise at your presence, for the way of women is on me;' and he searcheth, and had not found the teraphim.
\v 36 And it is displeasing to Jacob, and he striveth with Laban; and Jacob answereth and said to Laban, 'What is my transgression? what my sin, that you hast burned after me?
\v 37 for you hast felt all my vessels: what hast you found of all the vessels of your house? set here before my brethren, and your brethren, and they decide between us both.
\v 38 These twenty years I am with you: your ewes and your she-goats have not miscarried, and the rams of your flock I have not eaten;
\v 39 the torn I have not brought in unto you — I, I repay it — from my hand you will seek it; I have been deceived by day, and I have been deceived by night;
\v 40 I have been thus: in the day consumed me had drought, and frost by night, and wander did my sleep from mine eyes.
\v 41 This is to me twenty years in your house: I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock; and you changest my hire ten times;
\v 42 unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been for me, surely now empty you hadst sent me away; mine affliction and the labour of my hands had God seen, and reproveth yesternight.'
\v 43 And Laban answereth and said unto Jacob, 'The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flock my flock, and all that you are seeing is mine; and to my daughters — what do I to these to-day, or to their sons whom they have born?
\v 44 and now, come, let us make a covenant, I and you, and it had been for a witness between me and you.'
\v 45 And Jacob took a stone, and lifteth it up for a standing pillar;
\v 46 and Jacob said to his brethren, 'Gather stones,' and they take stones, and make a heap; and they eat there on the heap;
\v 47 and Laban called it Jegar-Sahadutha; and Jacob had called it Galeed.
\v 48 And Laban said, 'This heap is witness between me and you to-day;' therefore had he called its name Galeed;
\v 49 Mizpah also, for he said, 'Yahweh did watch between me and you, for we are hidden one from another;
\v 50 if you afflict my daughters, or take wives beside my daughters — there is no man with us — see, God is witness between me and you.'
\v 51 And Laban said to Jacob, 'Lo, this heap, and behold, the standing pillar which I have cast between me and you;
\v 52 this heap is witness, and the standing pillar is witness, that I do not pass over this heap unto you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this standing pillar unto me — for evil;
\v 53 the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, did judge between us — the God of their father,' and Jacob sweareth by the Fear of his father Isaac.
\v 54 And Jacob sacrificeth a sacrifice in the mount, and called to his brethren to eat bread, and they eat bread, and lodge in the mount;
\v 55 and Laban riseth early in the morning, and kisseth his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban went on, and turneth back to his place.
\c 32
\v 1 And Jacob had gone on his way, and messengers of God come upon him;
\v 2 and Jacob said, when he had seen them, 'This is the camp of God;' and he called the name of that place 'Two Camps.'
\v 3 And Jacob sent messengers before him unto Esau his brother, towards the land of Seir, the field of Edom,
\v 4 and commandeth them, saying, 'Thus do you say to my lord, to Esau: Thus said your servant Jacob, With Laban I have sojourned, and I tarry until now;
\v 5 and I have ox, and ass, flock, and man-servant, and maid-servant, and I send to declare to my lord, to find grace in his eyes.'
\v 6 And the messengers turn back unto Jacob, saying, 'We came in unto your brother, unto Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him;'
\v 7 and Jacob feareth exceedingly, and is distressed, and he divideth the people who are with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps,
\v 8 and said, 'If Esau come in unto the one camp, and have smitten it — then the camp which is left had been for an escape.'
\v 9 And Jacob said, 'God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh who said unto me, Turn back to your land, and to your kindred, and I do good with you:
\v 10 I have been unworthy of all the kind acts, and of all the truth which You hast done with your servant — for, with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
\v 11 Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I am fearing him, less he come and have smitten me — mother beside sons;
\v 12 and You — You hast said, I certainly do good with you, and have set your seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered because of the multitude.'
\v 13 And he lodgeth there during that night, and took from that which is coming into his hand, a present for Esau his brother:
\v 14 she-goats two hundred, and he-goats twenty, ewes two hundred, and rams twenty,
\v 15 suckling camels and their young ones thirty, cows forty, and bullocks ten, she-asses twenty, and foals ten;
\v 16 and he gave into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, 'Pass over before me, and a space you do put between drove and drove.'
\v 17 And he commandeth the first, saying, 'When Esau my brother meeteth you, and had asked you, saying, Whose are you? and where goest you? and whose are these before you?
\v 18 then you hast said, Your servant Jacob's: it is a present sent to my lord, to Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.'
\v 19 And he commandeth also the second, also the third, also all who are going after the droves, saying, 'According to this manner do you speak unto Esau in your finding him,
\v 20 and you have said also, Lo, your servant Jacob is behind us;' for he said, 'I pacify his face with the present which is going before me, and afterwards I see his face; it may be he lifteth up my face;'
\v 21 and the present passeth over before his face, and he had lodged during that night in the camp.
\v 22 And he riseth in that night, and took his two wives, and his two maid-servants, and his eleven children, and passeth over the passage of Jabbok;
\v 23 and he took them, and caused them to pass over the brook, and he caused that which he had to pass over.
\v 24 And Jacob is left alone, and one wrestleth with him till the ascending of the dawn;
\v 25 and he saw that he is not able for him, and he came against the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh is disjointed in his wrestling with him;
\v 26 and he said, 'Send me away, for the dawn had ascended:' and he said, 'I send you not away, except you hast blessed me.'
\v 27 And he said unto him, 'What is your name?' and he said, 'Jacob.'
\v 28 And he said, 'Your name is no more called Jacob, but Israel; for you hast been a prince with God and with men, and will prevail.'
\v 29 And Jacob asketh, and said, 'Declare, I pray you, your name;' and he said, 'Why is this, you askest for My name?' and He blessed him there.
\v 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for 'I have seen God face unto face, and my life is delivered;'
\v 31 and the sun riseth on him when he had passed over Penuel, and he is halting on his thigh;
\v 32 therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which shrank, which is on the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because He came against the hollow of Jacob's thigh, against the sinew which shrank.
\c 33
\v 1 And Jacob lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and behold, Esau is coming, and with him four hundred men; and he divideth the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two maid-servants;
\v 2 and he setteth the maid-servants and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.
\v 3 And he himself passed over before them, and boweth himself to the earth seven times, until his drawing nigh unto his brother,
\v 4 and Esau runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and falleth on his neck, and kisseth him, and they weep;
\v 5 and he lifteth up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, 'What are these to you?' And he said, 'The children with whom God had favoured your servant.'
\v 6 And the maid-servants draw nigh, they and their children, and bow themselves;
\v 7 and Leah also draweth nigh, and her children, and they bow themselves; and afterwards Joseph had drawn nigh with Rachel, and they bow themselves.
\v 8 And he said, 'What to you is all this camp which I have met?' and he said, 'To find grace in the eyes of my lord.'
\v 9 And Esau said, 'I have abundance, my brother, let it be to thyself that which you hast.'
\v 10 And Jacob said, 'Nay, I pray you, if, I pray you, I have found grace in yours eyes, then you hast received my present from my hand, because that I have seen your face, as the seeing of the face of God, and you are pleased with me;
\v 11 receive, I pray you, my blessing, which is brought to you, because God had favoured me, and because I have all things;' and he presseth on him, and he receiveth,
\v 12 and said, 'Let us journey and go on, and I go on before you.'
\v 13 And he said unto him, 'My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the suckling flock and the herd are with me; when they have beaten them one day, then had all the flock died.
\v 14 Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant, and I — I lead on gently, according to the foot of the work which is before me, and to the foot of the children, until that I come unto my lord, to Seir.'
\v 15 And Esau said, 'Let me, I pray you, place with you some of the people who are with me;' and he said, 'Why is this? I find grace in the eyes of my lord.'
\v 16 And turn back on that day did Esau on his way to Seir;
\v 17 and Jacob had journeyed to Succoth, and built to himself a house, and for his cattle had made booths, therefore had he called the name of the place Succoth.
\v 18 And Jacob came in to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and encampeth before the city,
\v 19 and he buyeth the portion of the field where he had stretched out his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitah;
\v 20 and he setteth up there an altar, and proclaimeth at it God — the God of Israel.
\c 34
\v 1 And Dinah, daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to look on the daughters of the land,
\v 2 and Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the land, saw her, and took her, and lieth with her, and humbleth her;
\v 3 and his soul cleaveth to Dinah, daughter of Jacob, and he loveth the young person, and spoke unto the heart of the young person.
\v 4 And Shechem spoke unto Hamor his father, saying, 'Take for me this damsel for a wife.'
\v 5 And Jacob had heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob kept silent till their coming.
\v 6 And Hamor, father of Shechem, went out unto Jacob to speak with him;
\v 7 and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard, and the men grieve themselves, and it is very displeasing to them, for folly he had done against Israel, to lie with the daughter of Jacob — and so it is not done.
\v 8 And Hamor spoke with them, saying, 'Shechem, my son, his soul had cleaved to your daughter; give her, I pray you, to him for a wife,
\v 9 and join you in marriage with us; your daughters you give to us, and our daughters you take to yourselves,
\v 10 and with us you dwell, and the land is before you; dwell you and trade in it, and have possessions in it.'
\v 11 And Shechem said unto her father, and unto her brethren, 'Let me find grace in your eyes, and that which you say unto me, I give;
\v 12 multiply on me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I give as you say unto me, and give to me the young person for a wife.'
\v 13 And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and they speak (because he defiled Dinah their sister),
\v 14 and say unto them, 'We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who had a foreskin: for it is a reproach to us.
\v 15 'Only for this we consent to you; if you be as we, to have every male of you circumcised,
\v 16 then we have given our daughters to you, and your daughters we take to ourselves, and we have dwelt with you, and have become one people;
\v 17 and if you hearken not unto us to be circumcised, then we have taken our daughter, and have gone.'
\v 18 And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son;
\v 19 and the young man delayed not to do the thing, for he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he is honourable above all the house of his father.
\v 20 And Hamor came — Shechem his son also — unto the gate of their city, and they speak unto the men of their city, saying,
\v 21 These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in the land, and trade in it; and the land, behold, is wide before them; their daughters let us take to ourselves for wives, and our daughters give to them.
\v 22 'Only for this do the men consent to us, to dwell with us, to become one people, in every male of us being circumcised, as they are circumcised;
\v 23 their cattle, and their substance, and all their beasts — are they not ours? only let us consent to them, and they dwell with us.'
\v 24 And unto Hamor, and unto Shechem his son, hearken do all those going out of the gate of his city, and every male is circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city.
\v 25 And it came to pass, on the third day, in their being pained, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, take each his sword, and come in against the city confidently, and slay every male;
\v 26 and Hamor, and Shechem his son, they have killed by the mouth of the sword, and they take Dinah out of Shechem's house, and go out.
\v 27 Jacob's sons have come in upon the wounded, and they spoil the city, because they had defiled their sister;
\v 28 their flock and their herd, and their asses, and that which is in the city, and that which is in the field, have they taken;
\v 29 and all their wealth, and all their infants, and their wives they have taken captive, and they spoil also all that is in the house.
\v 30 And Jacob said unto Simeon and unto Levi, 'Ye have troubled me, by causing me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanite, and among the Perizzite: and I am few in number, and they have been gathered against me, and have smitten me, and I have been destroyed, I and my house.'
\v 31 And they say, 'As a harlot did he make our sister?'
\c 35
\v 1 And God said unto Jacob, 'Rise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared unto you in your fleeing from the face of Esau your brother.'
\v 2 And Jacob said unto his household, and unto all who are with him, 'Turn aside the gods of the stranger which are in your middle, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments;
\v 3 and we rise, and go up to Bethel, and I make there an altar to God, who is answering me in the day of my distress, and is with me in the way that I have gone.'
\v 4 And they give unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger that are in their hand, and the rings that are in their ears, and Jacob hideth them under the oak which is by Shechem;
\v 5 and they journey, and the terror of God is on the cities which are round about them, and they have not pursued after the sons of Jacob.
\v 6 And Jacob came in to Luz which is in the land of Canaan (it is Bethel), he and all the people who are with him,
\v 7 and he built there an altar, and proclaimeth at the place the God of Bethel: for there had God been revealed unto him, in his fleeing from the face of his brother.
\v 8 And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, dieth, and she is buried at the lower part of Bethel, under the oak, and he called its name 'Oak of weeping.'
\v 9 And God appeareth unto Jacob again, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and blessed him;
\v 10 and God said to him, 'Your name is Jacob: your name is no more called Jacob, but Israel is your name;' and He called his name Israel.
\v 11 And God said to him, 'I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply, a nation and an assembly of nations is from you, and kings from your loins go out;
\v 12 and the land which I have given to Abraham and to Isaac — to you I give it, yea to your seed after you I give the land.'
\v 13 And God went up from him, in the place where He had spoken with him.
\v 14 And Jacob setteth up a standing pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a standing pillar of stone, and he poureth on it an oblation, and he poureth on it oil;
\v 15 and Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him Bethel.
\v 16 And they journey from Bethel, and there is yet a kibrath of land before entering Ephratha, and Rachel beareth, and is sharply pained in her bearing;
\v 17 and it came to pass, in her being sharply pained in her bearing, that the midwife said to her, 'Fear not, for this also is a son for you.'
\v 18 And it came to pass in the going out of her soul (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; and his father called him Benjamin;
\v 19 and Rachel dieth, and is buried in the way to Ephratha, which is Bethlehem,
\v 20 and Jacob setteth up a standing pillar over her grave; which is the standing pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
\v 21 And Israel journeyeth, and stretcheth out his tent beyond the tower of Edar;
\v 22 and it came to pass in Israel's dwelling in that land, that Reuben went, and lieth with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heareth.
\v 23 And the sons of Jacob are twelve. Sons of Leah: Jacob's first-born Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
\v 24 Sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
\v 25 And sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant: Dan and Naphtali.
\v 26 And sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant: Gad and Asher. These are sons of Jacob, who have been born to him in Padan-Aram.
\v 27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father, at Mamre, the city of Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac have sojourned.
\v 28 And the days of Isaac are a hundred and eighty years,
\v 29 and Isaac expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people, aged and satisfied with days; and bury him do Esau and Jacob his sons.
\c 36
\v 1 And these are births of Esau, who is Edom.
\v 2 Esau had taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
\v 3 and Bashemath daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebajoth.
\v 4 And Adah beareth to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath had born Reuel;
\v 5 and Aholibamah had born Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These are sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
\v 6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from the face of Jacob his brother;
\v 7 for their substance was more abundant than to dwell together, and the land of their sojournings was not able to bear them because of their cattle;
\v 8 and Esau dwelleth in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
\v 9 And these are births of Esau, father of Edom, in mount Seir.
\v 10 These are the names of the sons of Esau: Eliphaz son of Adah, wife of Esau; Reuel son of Bashemath, wife of Esau.
\v 11 And the sons of Eliphaz are Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz;
\v 12 and Timnath had been concubine to Eliphaz son of Esau, and she beareth to Eliphaz, Amalek; these are sons of Adah wife of Esau.
\v 13 And these are sons of Reuel: Nahad and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah; these were sons of Bashemath wife of Esau.
\v 14 And these have been the sons of Aholibamah daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon, wife of Esau; and she beareth to Esau, Jeush and Jaalam and Korah.
\v 15 These are chiefs of the sons of Esau: sons of Eliphaz, first-born of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
\v 16 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek; these are chiefs of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom; these are sons of Adah.
\v 17 And these are sons of Reuel son of Esau: chief Nahad, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah; these are chiefs of Reuel, in the land of Edom; these are sons of Bashemath wife of Esau.
\v 18 And these are sons of Aholibamah wife of Esau: chief Jeush, chief Jaalam, chief Korah; these are chiefs of Aholibamah daughter of Anah, wife of Esau.
\v 19 These are sons of Esau (who is Edom), and these their chiefs.
\v 20 These are sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
\v 21 and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan; these are chiefs of the Horites, sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.
\v 22 And the sons of Lotan are Hori and Heman; and a sister of Lotan is Timna.
\v 23 And these are sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahad, and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
\v 24 And these are sons of Zibeon, both Ajah and Anah: it is Anah that had found the Imim in the wilderness, in his feeding the asses of Zibeon his father.
\v 25 And these are sons of Anah: Dishon, and Aholibamah daughter of Anah.
\v 26 And these are sons of Dishon: Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
\v 27 These are sons of Ezer: Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
\v 28 These are sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
\v 29 These are chiefs of the Horite: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
\v 30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are chiefs of the Horite in reference to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
\v 31 And these are the kings who have reigned in the land of Edom before the reigning of a king over the sons of Israel.
\v 32 And Bela son of Beor reigneth in Edom, and the name of his city is Dinhabah;
\v 33 and Bela dieth, and reign in his stead did Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah;
\v 34 and Jobab dieth, and reign in his stead did Husham from the land of the Temanite.
\v 35 And Husham dieth, and reign in his stead did Hadad son of Bedad (who smiteth Midian in the field of Moab), and the name of his city is Avith;
\v 36 and Hadad dieth, and reign in his stead did Samlah of Masrekah;
\v 37 and Samlah dieth, and reign in his stead did Saul from Rehoboth of the River;

\v 39 and Baal-hanan son of Achbor dieth, and reign in his stead did Hadar, and the name of his city is Pau; and his wife's name is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, daughter of Me-zahab.
\v 40 And these are the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families, according to their places, by their names: chief Timnah, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
\v 41 chief Aholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
\v 42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
\v 43 chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are chiefs of Edom, in reference to their dwellings, in the land of their possession; he is Esau father of Edom.
\c 37
\v 1 And Jacob dwelleth in the land of his father's sojournings — in the land of Canaan.
\v 2 These are births of Jacob: Joseph, a son of seventeen years, had been enjoying himself with his brethren among the flock, (and he is a youth,) with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and Joseph brought in an account of their evil unto their father.
\v 3 And Israel had loved Joseph more than any of his sons, for he is a son of his old age, and had made for him a long coat;
\v 4 and his brethren see that their father had loved him more than any of his brethren, and they hate him, and have not been able to speak to him peaceably.
\v 5 And Joseph dreameth a dream, and declareth to his brethren, and they add still more to hate him.
\v 6 And he said unto them, 'Hear you, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
\v 7 that, behold, we are binding bundles in the middle of the field, and behold, my bundle had arisen, and had also stood up, and behold, your bundles are round about, and bow themselves to my bundle.'
\v 8 And his brethren say to him, 'Dost you certainly reign over us? will you certainly rule over us?' and they add still more to hate him, for his dreams, and for his words.
\v 9 And he dreameth yet another dream, and recounteth it to his brethren, and said, 'Lo, I have dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon, and eleven stars, are bowing themselves to me.'
\v 10 And he recounteth unto his father, and unto his brethren; and his father pusheth against him, and said to him, 'What is this dream which you hast dreamt? do we certainly come — I, and your mother, and your brethren — to bow ourselves to you, to the earth?'
\v 11 and his brethren are zealous against him, and his father had watched the matter.
\v 12 And his brethren go to feed the flock of their father in Shechem,
\v 13 and Israel said unto Joseph, 'Are not your brethren feeding in Shechem? come, and I send you unto them;' and he said to him, 'Here am I;'
\v 14 and he said to him, 'Go, I pray you, see the peace of your brethren, and the peace of the flock, and bring me back word;' and he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
\v 15 And a man finds him, and behold, he is wandering in the field, and the man asketh him, saying, 'What seekest you?'
\v 16 and he said, 'My brethren I am seeking, declare to me, I pray you, where they are feeding?'
\v 17 And the man said, 'They have journeyed from this, for I have heard some saying, Let us go to Dothan,' and Joseph went after his brethren, and finds them in Dothan.
\v 18 And they see him from afar, even before he draweth near unto them, and they conspire against him to put him to death.
\v 19 And they say one unto another, 'Lo, this man of the dreams came;
\v 20 and now, come, and we slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and have said, An evil beast had devoured him; and we see what his dreams are.'
\v 21 And Reuben heareth, and delivereth him out of their hand, and said, 'Let us not smite the life;'
\v 22 and Reuben said unto them, 'Shed no blood; cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and put not forth a hand upon him,' — in order to deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back unto his father.
\v 23 And it came to pass, when Joseph had come unto his brethren, that they strip Joseph of his coat, the long coat which is upon him,
\v 24 and take him and cast him into the pit, and the pit is empty, there is no water in it.
\v 25 And they sit down to eat bread, and they lift up their eyes, and look, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels bearing spices, and balm, and myrrh, going to take them down to Egypt.
\v 26 And Judah said unto his brethren, 'What gain when we slay our brother, and have concealed his blood?
\v 27 Come, and we sell him to the Ishmaelites, and our hands are not on him, for he is our brother — our flesh;' and his brethren hearken.
\v 28 And Midianite merchantmen pass by and they draw out and bring up Joseph out of the pit, and sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silverlings, and they bring Joseph into Egypt.
\v 29 And Reuben returneth unto the pit, and behold, Joseph is not in the pit, and he rendeth his garments,
\v 30 and he returneth unto his brethren, and said, 'The lad is not, and I — where am I going?'
\v 31 And they take the coat of Joseph, and slaughter a kid of the goats, and dip the coat in the blood,
\v 32 and send the long coat, and they bring it in unto their father, and say, 'This have we found; discern, we pray you, whether it is your son's coat or not?'
\v 33 And he discerneth it, and said, 'My son's coat! an evil beast had devoured him; torn — torn is Joseph!'
\v 34 And Jacob rendeth his raiment, and putteth sackcloth on his loins, and became a mourner for his son many days,
\v 35 and all his sons and all his daughters rise to comfort him, and he refuseth to comfort himself, and said, 'For — I go down mourning unto my son, to Sheol,' and his father weepeth for him.
\v 36 And the Medanites have sold him unto Egypt, to Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners.
\c 38
\v 1 And it came to pass, at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turneth aside unto a man, an Adullamite, whose name is Hirah;
\v 2 and Judah saw there the daughter of a man, a Canaanite, whose name is Shuah, and took her, and went in unto her.
\v 3 And she conceiveth, and beareth a son, and he called his name Er;
\v 4 and she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and called his name Onan;
\v 5 and she addeth again, and beareth a son, and called his name Shelah; and he was in Chezib in her bearing him.
\v 6 And Judah took a wife for Er, his first-born, and her name is Tamar;
\v 7 and Er, Judah's first-born, is evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh did put him to death.
\v 8 And Judah said to Onan, 'Go in unto the wife of your brother, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother;'
\v 9 and Onan knoweth that the seed is not reckoned his; and it had come to pass, if he had gone in unto his brother's wife, that he had destroyed it to the earth, so as not to give seed to his brother;
\v 10 and that which he had done is evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and He putteth him also to death.
\v 11 And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, 'Abide a widow at your father's house, till Shelah my son groweth up;' for he said, 'Lest he die — even he — like his brethren;' and Tamar went and dwelleth at her father's house.
\v 12 And the days are multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah, Judah's wife, dieth; and Judah is comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnath.
\v 13 And it is declared to Tamar, saying, 'Lo, your husband's father is going up to Timnath to shear his flock;'
\v 14 and she turneth aside the garments of her widowhood from off her, and covereth herself with a vail, and wrappeth herself up, and sitteth in the opening of Enayim, which is by the way to Timnath, for she had seen that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him for a wife.
\v 15 And Judah saw her, and reckoneth her for a harlot, for she had covered her face,
\v 16 and he turneth aside unto her by the way, and said, 'Come, I pray you, let me come in unto you,' (for he had not known that she is his daughter-in-law); and she said, 'What will you give to me, that you may come in unto me?'
\v 17 and he said, 'I — I send a kid of the goats from the flock.' And she said, 'Dost you give a pledge till you send it?'
\v 18 and he said, 'What is the pledge that I give to you?' and she said, 'Your seal, and your ribbon, and your staff which is in your hand;' and he gave to her, and went in unto her, and she conceiveth to him;
\v 19 and she riseth, and went, and turneth aside her vail from off her, and putteth on the garments of her widowhood.
\v 20 And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the hand of the woman, and he had not found her.
\v 21 And he asketh the men of her place, saying, 'Where is the separated one — she in Enayim, by the way?' and they say, 'There had not been in this place a separated one.'
\v 22 And he turneth back unto Judah, and said, 'I have not found her; and the men of the place also have said, There had not been in this place a separated one,'
\v 23 and Judah said, 'Let her take to herself, lest we become despised; behold, I sent this kid, and you hast not found her.'
\v 24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it is declared to Judah, saying, 'Tamar your daughter-in-law had committed fornication; and also, behold, she had conceived by fornication:' and Judah said, 'Bring her out — and she is burnt.'
\v 25 She is brought out, and she had sent unto her husband's father, saying, 'To a man whose these are, I am pregnant;' and she said, 'Discern, I pray you, whose are these — the seal, and the ribbons, and the staff.'
\v 26 And Judah discerneth and said, 'She had been more righteous than I, because that I did not give her to Shelah my son;' and he had not added to know her again.
\v 27 And it came to pass in the time of her bearing, that behold, twins are in her womb;
\v 28 and it came to pass in her bearing, that one gave out a hand, and the midwife took and bindeth on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, 'This had come out first.'
\v 29 And it came to pass as he draweth back his hand, that behold, his brother had come out, and she said, 'What! you hast broken forth — on you is the breach;' and he called his name Pharez;
\v 30 and afterwards had his brother come out, on whose hand is the scarlet thread, and he called his name Zarah.
\c 39
\v 1 And Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, head of the executioners, an Egyptian man, buyeth him out of the hands of the Ishmaelites who have brought him thither.
\v 2 And Yahweh is with Joseph, and he is a prosperous man, and he is in the house of his lord the Egyptian,
\v 3 and his lord saw that Yahweh is with him, and all that he is doing Yahweh is causing to prosper in his hand,
\v 4 and Joseph finds grace in his eyes and serveth him, and he appointeth him over his house, and all that he had he had given into his hand.
\v 5 And it came to pass from the time that he had appointed him over his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and the blessing of Yahweh is on all that he had, in the house, and in the field;
\v 6 and he leaveth all that he had in the hand of Joseph, and he had not known anything that he had, except the bread which he is eating. And Joseph is of a fair form, and of a fair appearance.
\v 7 And it came to pass after these things, that his lord's wife lifteth up her eyes unto Joseph, and said, 'Lie with me;'
\v 8 and he refuseth, and said unto his lord's wife, 'Lo, my lord had not known what is with me in the house, and all that he had he had given into my hand;
\v 9 none is greater in this house than I, and he had not withheld from me anything, except you, because you are his wife; and how shall I do this great evil? — then have I sinned against God.'
\v 10 And it came to pass at her speaking unto Joseph day by day, that he had not hearkened unto her, to lie near her, to be with her;
\v 11 and it came to pass about this day, that he went into the house to do his work, and there is none of the men of the house there in the house,
\v 12 and she catcheth him by his garment, saying, 'Lie with me;' and he leaveth his garment in her hand, and fleeth, and went without.
\v 13 And it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and fleeth without,
\v 14 that she called for the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, 'See, he had brought in to us a man, a Hebrew, to play with us; he had come in unto me, to lie with me, and I call with a loud voice,
\v 15 and it came to pass, when he heareth that I have lifted up my voice and call, that he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth, and went without.'
\v 16 And she placeth his garment near her, until the coming in of his lord unto his house.
\v 17 And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, 'The Hebrew servant whom you hast brought unto us, had come in unto me to play with me;
\v 18 and it came to pass, when I lift my voice and call, that he leaveth his garment near me, and fleeth without.'
\v 19 And it came to pass when his lord heareth the words of his wife, which she had spoken unto him, saying, 'According to these things had your servant done to me,' that his anger burneth;
\v 20 and Joseph's lord took him, and putteth him unto the round-house, a place where the king's prisoners are bound; and he is there in the round-house.
\v 21 And Yahweh is with Joseph, and stretcheth out kindness unto him, and putteth his grace in the eyes of the chief of the round-house;
\v 22 and the chief of the round-house gave into the hand of Joseph all the prisoners who are in the round-house, and of all that they are doing there, he had been doer;
\v 23 the chief of the round-house saw not anything under his hand, because Yahweh is with him, and that which he is doing Yahweh is causing to prosper.
\c 40
\v 1 And it came to pass, after these things — the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker have sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt;
\v 2 and Pharaoh is wroth against his two eunuchs, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers,
\v 3 and gave them in charge in the house of the chief of the executioners, unto the round-house, the place where Joseph is a prisoner,
\v 4 and the chief of the executioners chargeth Joseph with them, and he serveth them; and they are days in charge.
\v 5 And they dream a dream both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker whom the king of Egypt had, who are prisoners in the round-house.
\v 6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and behold, they are morose;
\v 7 and he asketh Pharaoh's eunuchs who are with him in charge in the house of his lord, saying, 'Wherefore are your faces sad to-day?'
\v 8 And they say unto him, 'A dream we have dreamed, and there is no interpreter of it;' and Joseph said unto them, 'Are not interpretations with God? recount, I pray you, to me.'
\v 9 And the chief of the butlers recounteth his dream to Joseph, and said to him, 'In my dream, then behold, a vine is before me!
\v 10 and in the vine are three branches, and it is as it were flourishing; gone up had its blossom, its clusters have ripened grapes;
\v 11 and Pharaoh's cup is in my hand, and I take the grapes and press them into the cup of Pharaoh, and I give the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.'
\v 12 And Joseph said to him, 'This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;
\v 13 yet, within three days did Pharaoh lift up your head, and had put you back on your station, and you hast given the cup of Pharaoh into his hand, according to the former custom when you wast his butler.
\v 14 'Surely if you hast remembered me with you, when it is well with you, and hast done (I pray you) kindness with me, and hast made mention of me unto Pharaoh, then hast you brought me out from this house,
\v 15 for I was really stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they have put me in the pit.'
\v 16 And the chief of the bakers saw that he had interpreted good, and he said unto Joseph, 'I also am in a dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread are on my head,
\v 17 and in the uppermost basket are of all kinds of Pharaoh's food, work of a baker; and the birds are eating them out of the basket, from off my head.'
\v 18 And Joseph answereth and said, 'This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;
\v 19 yet, within three days did Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and had hanged you on a tree, and the birds have eaten your flesh from off you.'
\v 20 And it came to pass, on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a banquet to all his servants, and lifteth up the head of the chief of the butlers, and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants,
\v 21 and he putteth back the chief of the butlers to his butlership, and he gave the cup into the hand of Pharaoh;
\v 22 and the chief of the bakers he had hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them;
\v 23 and the chief of the butlers had not remembered Joseph, but forgetteth him.
\c 41
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the end of two years of days that Pharaoh is dreaming, and behold, he is standing by the River,
\v 2 and behold, from the River coming up are seven kine, of fair appearance, and fat in flesh, and they feed among the reeds;
\v 3 and behold, seven other kine are coming up after them out of the River, of bad appearance, and lean in flesh, and they stand near the kine on the edge of the River,
\v 4 and the kine of bad appearance and lean in flesh eat up the seven kine of fair appearance, and fat — and Pharaoh awaketh.
\v 5 And he sleepeth, and dreameth a second time, and behold, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, fat and good,
\v 6 and behold, seven ears, thin, and blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;
\v 7 and the thin ears swallow the seven fat and full ears — and Pharaoh awaketh, and behold, a dream.
\v 8 And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit is moved, and he sent and called all the scribes of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh recounteth to them his dream, and there is no interpreter of them to Pharaoh.
\v 9 And the chief of the butlers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, 'My sin I mention this day:
\v 10 Pharaoh had been wroth against his servants, and gave me into charge in the house of the chief of the executioners, me and the chief of the bakers;
\v 11 and we dream a dream in one night, I and he, each according to the interpretation of his dream we have dreamed.
\v 12 And there is with us a youth, a Hebrew, servant to the chief of the executioners, and we recount to him, and he interpreteth to us our dreams, to each according to his dream had he interpreted,
\v 13 and it came to pass, as he had interpreted to us so it had been, me he put back on my station, and him he hanged.'
\v 14 And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they cause him to run out of the pit, and he shaveth, and changeth his garments, and came in unto Pharaoh.
\v 15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 'A dream I have dreamed, and there is no interpreter of it, and I — I have heard concerning you, saying, You understandest a dream to interpret it,'
\v 16 and Joseph answereth Pharaoh, saying, 'Without me — God did answer Pharaoh with peace.'
\v 17 And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph: 'In my dream, behold, I am standing by the edge of the River,
\v 18 and behold, out of the River coming up are seven kine, fat in flesh, and of fair form, and they feed among the reeds;
\v 19 and behold, seven other kine are coming up after them, thin, and of very bad form, and lean in flesh; I have not seen like these in all the land of Egypt for badness.
\v 20 'And the lean and the bad kine eat up the first seven fat kine,
\v 21 and they come in unto their middle, and it had not been known that they have come in unto their middle, and their appearance is bad as at the commencement; and I awake.
\v 22 'And I see in my dream, and behold, seven ears are coming up on one stalk, full and good;
\v 23 and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with an east wind, are springing up after them;
\v 24 and the thin ears swallow the seven good ears; and I tell unto the scribes, and there is none declaring to me.'
\v 25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, 'The dream of Pharaoh is one: that which God is doing he had declared to Pharaoh;
\v 26 the seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years, the dream is one;
\v 27 and the seven thin and bad kine which are coming up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears, blasted with an east wind, are seven years of famine;
\v 28 this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: That which God is doing, he had shewn Pharaoh.
\v 29 'Lo, seven years are coming of great abundance in all the land of Egypt,
\v 30 and seven years of famine have arisen after them, and all the plenty is forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine had finished the land,
\v 31 and the plenty is not known in the land because of that famine afterwards, for it is very grievous.
\v 32 'And because of the repeating of the dream unto Pharaoh twice, surely the thing is established by God, and God is hastening to do it.
\v 33 'And now, let Pharaoh provide a man, intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt;
\v 34 let Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, and receive a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty,
\v 35 and they gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh — food in the cities; and they have kept it,
\v 36 and the food had been for a store for the land, for the seven years of famine which are in the land of Egypt; and the land is cut off by the famine.'
\v 37 And the thing is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants,
\v 38 and Pharaoh said unto his servants, 'Do we find like this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?'
\v 39 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 'After God's causing you to know all this, there is none intelligent and wise as you;
\v 40 you — you are over my house, and at your mouth do all my people kiss; only in the throne I am greater than you.'
\v 41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 'See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.'
\v 42 And Pharaoh turneth aside his seal-ring from off his hand, and putteth it on the hand of Joseph, and clotheth him with garments of fine linen, and placeth a chain of gold on his neck,
\v 43 and caused him to ride in the second chariot which he had, and they proclaim before him, 'Bow the knee!' and — to put him over all the land of Egypt.
\v 44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 'I am Pharaoh, and without you a man did not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt;'
\v 45 and Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he gave to him Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, for a wife, and Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
\v 46 And Joseph is a son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and passeth over through all the land of Egypt;
\v 47 and the land made in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
\v 48 And he gathereth all the food of the seven years which have been in the land of Egypt, and putteth food in the cities; the food of the field which is round about each city had he put in its middle;
\v 49 and Joseph gathereth corn as sand of the sea, multiplying exceedingly, until that he had ceased to number, for there is no number.
\v 50 And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, had borne to him,
\v 51 and Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: 'for, God had made me to forget all my labour, and all the house of my father;'
\v 52 and the name of the second he had called Ephraim: 'for, God had caused me to be fruitful in the land of mine affliction.'
\v 53 And the seven years of plenty are completed which have been in the land of Egypt,
\v 54 and the seven years of famine begin to come, as Joseph said, and famine is in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt had been bread;
\v 55 and all the land of Egypt is famished, and the people crieth unto Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, 'Go unto Joseph; that which he said to you — do.'
\v 56 And the famine has been over all the face of the land, and Joseph opened all places which have corn in them, and selleth to the Egyptians; and the famine is severe in the land of Egypt,
\v 57 and all the earth had come to Egypt, to buy, unto Joseph, for the famine was severe in all the earth.
\c 42
\v 1 And Jacob saw that there is corn in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, 'Why do you look at each other?'
\v 2 he said also, 'Lo, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt, go down thither, and buy for us from there, and we live and do not die;'
\v 3 and the ten brethren of Joseph go down to buy corn in Egypt,
\v 4 and Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob had not sent with his brethren, for he said, 'Lest mischief meet him.'
\v 5 And the sons of Israel come to buy in the middle of those coming, for the famine had been in the land of Canaan,
\v 6 and Joseph is the ruler over the land, he who is selling to all the people of the land, and Joseph's brethren come and bow themselves to him — face to the earth.
\v 7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and discerneth them, and made himself strange unto them, and spoke with them sharp things, and said unto them, 'From whence have you come?' and they say, 'From the land of Canaan — to buy food.'
\v 8 And Joseph discerneth his brethren, but they have not discerned him,
\v 9 and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, 'Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you have come.'
\v 10 And they say unto him, 'No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food;
\v 11 we are all of us sons of one man, we are right men; your servants have not been spies;'
\v 12 and he said unto them, 'No, but the nakedness of the land you have come to see;'
\v 13 and they say, 'Your servants are twelve brethren; we are sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the young one is with our father to-day, and the one is not.'
\v 14 And Joseph said unto them, 'This is that which I have spoken unto you, saying, Ye are spies,
\v 15 by this you are proved: Pharaoh lived! if you go out from this — except by your young brother coming hither;
\v 16 send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and you, remain you bound, and let your words be proved, whether truth be with you: and if not — Pharaoh lived! surely you are spies;'
\v 17 and he removeth them unto charge three days.
\v 18 And Joseph said unto them on the third day, 'This do and live; God I fear!
\v 19 if you are right men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your ward, and you, go, carry in corn for the famine of your houses,
\v 20 and your young brother you bring unto me, and your words are established, and you die not;' and they do so.
\v 21 And they say one unto another, 'Verily we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul, in his making supplication unto us, and we did not hearken: therefore had this distress come upon us.'
\v 22 And Reuben answereth them, saying, 'Spake I not unto you, saying, Sin not against the lad? and you hearkened not; and his blood also, behold, it is required.'
\v 23 And they have not known that Joseph understandeth, for the interpreter is between them;
\v 24 and he turneth round from them, and weepeth, and turneth back unto them, and spoke unto them, and took from them Simeon, and bindeth him before their eyes.
\v 25 And Joseph commandeth, and they fill their vessels with corn, also to put back the money of each unto his sack, and to give to them provision for the way; and one did to them so.
\v 26 And they lift up their corn upon their asses, and go from there,
\v 27 and the one opened his sack to give provender to his ass at a lodging-place, and he saw his money, and behold, it is in the mouth of his bag,
\v 28 and he said unto his brethren, 'My money had been put back, and also, behold, in my bag:' and their heart went out, and they tremble, one to another saying, 'What is this God had done to us!'
\v 29 And they come in unto Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they declare to him all the things meeting them, saying,
\v 30 'The man, the lord of the land, had spoken with us sharp things, and made us as spies of the land;
\v 31 and we say unto him, We are right men, we have not been spies,
\v 32 we are twelve brethren, sons of our father, the one is not, and the young one is to-day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\v 33 And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, By this I know that you are right men — one of your brethren leave with me, and for the famine of your houses take you and go,
\v 34 and bring your young brother unto me, and I know that you are not spies, but you are right men; your brother I give to you, and you trade with the land.'
\v 35 And it came to pass, they are emptying their sacks, and behold, the bundle of each man's silver is in his sack, and they see their bundles of silver, they and their father, and are afraid;
\v 36 and Jacob their father said unto them, 'Me you have bereaved; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and Benjamin you take — against me have been all these.'
\v 37 And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, 'My two sons you will put to death, if I bring him not in unto you; give him into my hand, and I — I bring him back unto you;'
\v 38 and he said, 'My son did not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he by himself is left; when mischief had met him in the way in which you go, then you have brought down my grey hairs in sorrow to sheol.'
\c 43
\v 1 And the famine is severe in the land;
\v 2 and it came to pass, when they have finished eating the corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father said unto them, 'Turn back, buy for us a little food.'
\v 3 And Judah spoke unto him, saying, 'The man protesting protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your brother being with you;
\v 4 if you are sending our brother with us, we go down, and buy for you food,
\v 5 and if you are not sending — we do not go down, for the man said unto us, Ye do not see my face without your brother being with you.'
\v 6 And Israel said, 'Why did you evil to me, by declaring to the man that you had yet a brother?'
\v 7 and they say, 'The man asked diligently concerning us, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down your brother?'
\v 8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, 'Send the youth with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both we, and you, and our infants.
\v 9 I — I am surety for him, from my hand you will require him; if I have not brought him in unto you, and set him before you — then I have sinned against you all the days;
\v 10 for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned these two times.'
\v 11 And Israel their father said unto them, 'If so, now, this do: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;
\v 12 and double money take in your hand, even the money which is brought back in the mouth of your bags, you take back in your hand, it may be it is an oversight.
\v 13 'And take your brother, and rise, turn back unto the man;
\v 14 and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man, so that he had sent to you your other brother and Benjamin; and I, when I am bereaved — I am bereaved.'
\v 15 And the men take this present, double money also they have taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;
\v 16 and Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and said to him who is over his house, 'Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for with me do the men eat at noon.'
\v 17 And the man did as Joseph had said, and the man brought in the men into the house of Joseph,
\v 18 and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph, and they say, 'For the matter of the money which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we brought in — to roll himself upon us, and to throw himself on us, and to take us for servants — our asses also.'
\v 19 And they come nigh unto the man who is over the house of Joseph, and speak unto him at the opening of the house,
\v 20 and say, 'O, my lord, we really come down at the commencement to buy food;
\v 21 and it came to pass, when we have come in unto the lodging-place, and open our bags, that behold, each one's money is in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we bring it back in our hand;
\v 22 and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'
\v 23 And he said, 'Peace to you, fear not: your God and the God of your father had given to you hidden treasure in your bags, your money came unto me;' and he brought out Simeon unto them.
\v 24 And the man brought in the men into Joseph's house, and gave water, and they wash their feet; and he gave provender for their asses,
\v 25 and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread.
\v 26 And Joseph came into the house, and they bring to him the present which is in their hand, into the house, and bow themselves to him, to the earth;
\v 27 and he asketh of them of peace, and said, 'Is your father well? the aged man of whom you have spoken, is he yet alive?'
\v 28 and they say, 'Your servant our father is well, he is yet alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance.
\v 29 And he lifteth up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, 'Is this your young brother, of whom you have spoken unto me?' and he said, 'God favour you, my son.'
\v 30 And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner chamber, and weepeth there;
\v 31 and he washeth his face, and went out, and refraineth himself, and said, 'Place bread.'
\v 32 And they place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.
\v 33 And they sit before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the men wonder one at another;
\v 34 and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him.
\c 44
\v 1 And he commandeth him who is over his house, saying, 'Fill the bags of the men with food, as they are able to bear, and put the money of each in the mouth of his bag;
\v 2 and my cup, the silver cup, you will put in the mouth of the bag of the young one, and his corn-money;' and he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.
\v 3 The morning is bright, and the men have been sent away, they and their asses — 
\v 4 they have gone out of the city — they have not gone far off — and Joseph had said to him who is over his house, 'Rise, pursue after the men; and you hast overtaken them, and you hast said unto them, Why have you recompensed evil for good?
\v 5 Is not this that with which my lord drinketh? and he observeth diligently with it; you have done evil in that which you have done.'
\v 6 And he overtook them, and spoke unto them these words,
\v 7 and they say unto him, 'Why did my lord speak according to these words? far be it from your servants to do according to this word;
\v 8 behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back unto you from the land of Canaan, and how do we steal from the house of your lord silver or gold?
\v 9 with whomsoever of your servants it is found, he had died, and we also are to my lord for servants.'
\v 10 And he said, 'Now, also, according to your words, so it is; he with whom it is found became my servant, and you are acquitted;'
\v 11 and they hasten and take down each his bag to the earth, and each opened his bag;
\v 12 and he searcheth — at the eldest he had begun, and at the youngest he had completed — and the cup is found in the bag of Benjamin;
\v 13 and they rend their garments, and each ladeth his ass, and they turn back to the city.
\v 14 And Judah — his brethren also — came in unto the house of Joseph, and he is yet there, and they fall before him to the earth;
\v 15 and Joseph said to them, 'What is this deed that you have done? have you not known that a man like me did diligently observe?'
\v 16 And Judah said, 'What do we say to my lord? what do we speak? and what — do we justify ourselves? God had found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are servants to my lord, both we, and he in whose hand the cup had been found;'
\v 17 and he said, 'Far be it from me to do this; the man in whose hand the cup had been found, he became my servant; and you, go you up in peace unto your father.'
\v 18 And Judah came nigh unto him, and said, 'O, my lord, let your servant speak, I pray you, a word in the ears of my lord, and let not yours anger burn against your servant — for you are as Pharaoh.
\v 19 My lord had asked his servants, saying, Have you a father or brother?
\v 20 and we say unto my lord, We have a father, an aged one, and a child of old age, a little one; and his brother died, and he is left alone of his mother, and his father had loved him.
\v 21 'And you sayest unto your servants, Bring him down unto me, and I set mine eye upon him;
\v 22 and we say unto my lord, The youth is not able to leave his father, when he had left his father, then he had died;
\v 23 and you sayest unto your servants, If your young brother come not down with you, you add not to see my face.
\v 24 'And it came to pass, that we have come up unto your servant my father, that we declare to him the words of my lord;
\v 25 and our father said, Turn back, buy for us a little food,
\v 26 and we say, We are not able to go down; if our young brother is with us, then we have gone down; for we are not able to see the man's face, and our young brother not with us.
\v 27 And your servant my father said unto us, Ye — you have known that two did my wife bare to me,
\v 28 and the one went out from me, and I say, Surely he is torn — torn! and I have not seen him since;
\v 29 when you have taken also this from my presence, and mischief had met him, then you have brought down my grey hairs with evil to sheol.
\v 30 'And now, at my coming in unto your servant my father, and the youth not with us (and his soul is bound up in his soul),
\v 31 then it had come to pass when he saw that the youth is not, that he had died, and your servants have brought down the grey hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to sheol;
\v 32 for your servant obtained the youth by surety from my father, saying, If I bring him not in unto you — then I have sinned against my father all the days.
\v 33 'And now, let your servant, I pray you, abide instead of the youth a servant to my lord, and the youth went up with his brethren,
\v 34 for how do I go up unto my father, and the youth not with me? lest I look on the evil which did find my father.'
\c 45
\v 1 And Joseph had not been able to refrain himself before all those standing by him, and he called, 'Put out every man from me;' and no man had stood with him when Joseph made himself known unto his brethren,
\v 2 and he gave forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians hear, and the house of Pharaoh heareth.
\v 3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, 'I am Joseph, is my father yet alive?' and his brethren have not been able to answer him, for they have been troubled at his presence.
\v 4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, 'Come nigh unto me, I pray you,' and they come nigh; and he said, 'I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt;
\v 5 and now, be not grieved, nor let it be displeasing in your eyes that you sold me hither, for to preserve life had God sent me before you.
\v 6 Because these two years the famine is in the heart of the land, and yet are five years, in which there is neither ploughing nor harvest;
\v 7 and God sent me before you, to place of you a remnant in the land, and to give life to you by a great escape;
\v 8 and now, you — you have not sent me hither, but God, and He did set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\v 9 'Haste, and go up unto my father, then you have said to him, Thus said Joseph your son, God had set me for lord to all Egypt; come down unto me, stay not,
\v 10 and you hast dwelt in the land of Goshen, and been near unto me, you and your sons, and your son's sons, and your flock, and your herd, and all that you hast,
\v 11 and I have nourished you there — for yet are five years of famine — lest you become poor, you and your household, and all that you hast.
\v 12 And behold, your eyes are seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which is speaking unto you;
\v 13 and you have declared to my father all my honour in Egypt, and all that you have seen, and you have hasted, and have brought down my father hither.'
\v 14 And he falleth on the neck of Benjamin his brother, and weepeth, and Benjamin had wept on his neck;
\v 15 and he kisseth all his brethren, and weepeth over them; and afterwards have his brethren spoken with him.
\v 16 And the sound had been heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, 'Come have the brethren of Joseph;' and it is good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,
\v 17 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 'Say unto your brethren, This do you: lade your beasts, and go, enter you the land of Canaan,
\v 18 and take your father, and your households, and come unto me, and I give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and eat you the fat of the land.
\v 19 Yea, you — you hast been commanded: this do you, take for yourselves out of the land of Egypt, waggons for your infants, and for your wives, and you have brought your father, and come;
\v 20 and your eye had no pity on your vessels, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.'
\v 21 And the sons of Israel do so, and Joseph gave waggons to them by the command of Pharaoh, and he gave to them provision for the way;
\v 22 to all of them had he given — to each changes of garments, and to Benjamin he had given three hundred silverlings, and five changes of garments;
\v 23 and to his father he had sent thus: ten asses bearing of the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses bearing corn and bread, even food for his father for the way.
\v 24 And he sent his brethren away, and they go; and he said unto them, 'Be not angry in the way.'
\v 25 And they go up out of Egypt, and come in to the land of Canaan, unto Jacob their father,
\v 26 and they declare to him, saying, 'Joseph is yet alive,' and that he is ruler over all the land of Egypt; and his heart ceaseth, for he had not given credence to them.
\v 27 And they speak unto him all the words of Joseph, which he had spoken unto them, and he saw the waggons which Joseph had sent to bear him away, and live did the spirit of Jacob their father;
\v 28 and Israel said, 'Enough! Joseph my son is yet alive; I go and see him before I die.'
\c 46
\v 1 And Israel journeyeth, and all that he had, and came in to Beer-Sheba, and sacrificeth sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac;
\v 2 and God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, 'Jacob, Jacob;' and he said, 'Here am I.'
\v 3 And He said, 'I am God, God of your father, be not afraid of going down to Egypt, for for a great nation I set you there;
\v 4 I — I go down with you to Egypt, and I — I also certainly bring you up, and Joseph did put his hand on yours eyes.'
\v 5 And Jacob riseth from Beer-Sheba, and the sons of Israel bear away Jacob their father, And their infants, and their wives, in the waggons which Pharaoh had sent to bear him,
\v 6 and they take their cattle, and their goods which they have acquired in the land of Canaan, and come into Egypt — Jacob, and all his seed with him,
\v 7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, yea, all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.
\v 8 And these are the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt: Jacob and his sons, Jacob's first-born, Reuben.
\v 9 And sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
\v 10 And sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul son of the Canaanitess.
\v 11 And sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohad, and Merari.
\v 12 And sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah, (and Er and Onan die in the land of Canaan.) And sons of Pharez are Hezron and Hamul.
\v 13 And sons of Issachar: Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
\v 14 And sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
\v 15 These are sons of Leah whom she bare to Jacob in Padan-Aram, and Dinah his daughter; all the persons of his sons and his daughters are thirty and three.
\v 16 And sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
\v 17 And sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
\v 18 These are sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and she beareth these to Jacob — sixteen persons.
\v 19 Sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
\v 20 And born to Joseph in the land of Egypt (whom Asenath daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of On, had borne to him) are Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 21 And sons of Benjamin: Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
\v 22 These are sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the persons are fourteen.
\v 23 And sons of Dan: Hushim.
\v 24 And sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
\v 25 These are sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter; and she beareth these to Jacob — all the persons are seven.
\v 26 All the persons who are coming to Jacob to Egypt, coming out of his thigh, apart from the wives of Jacob's sons, all the persons are sixty and six.
\v 27 And the sons of Joseph who have been born to him in Egypt are two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who are coming into Egypt are seventy.
\v 28 And Judah he had sent before him unto Joseph, to direct before him to Goshen, and they come into the land of Goshen;
\v 29 and Joseph harnesseth his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and appeareth unto him, and falleth on his neck, and weepeth on his neck again;
\v 30 and Israel said unto Joseph, 'Let me die this time, after my seeing your face, for you are yet alive.'
\v 31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto the house of his father, 'I go up, and declare to Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and the house of my father who are in the land of Canaan have come in unto me;
\v 32 and the men are feeders of a flock, for they have been men of cattle; and their flock, and their herd, and all that they have, they have brought.'
\v 33 And it had come to pass when Pharaoh called for you, and had said, What are your works?
\v 34 that you have said, Your servants have been men of cattle from our youth, even until now, both we and our fathers, — in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for the abomination of the Egyptians is every one feeding a flock.'
\c 47
\v 1 And Joseph came, and declareth to Pharaoh, and said, 'My father, and my brethren, and their flock, and their herd, and all they have, have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.'
\v 2 And out of his brethren he had taken five men, and setteth them before Pharaoh;
\v 3 and Pharaoh said unto his brethren, 'What are your works?' and they say unto Pharaoh, 'Your servants are feeders of a flock, both we and our fathers;'
\v 4 and they say unto Pharaoh, 'To sojourn in the land we have come, for there is no pasture for the flock which your servants have, for grievous is the famine in the land of Canaan; and now, let your servants, we pray you, dwell in the land of Goshen.'
\v 5 And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, 'Your father and your brethren have come unto you:
\v 6 the land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land cause your father and your brethren to dwell — they dwell in the land of Goshen, and if you hast known, and there are among them men of ability, then you hast set them heads over the cattle I have.'
\v 7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and caused him to stand before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
\v 8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, 'How many are the days of the years of your life?'
\v 9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, 'The days of the years of my sojournings are an hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their sojournings.'
\v 10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
\v 11 And Joseph settleth his father and his brethren, and gave to them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded;
\v 12 and Joseph nourisheth his father, and his brethren, and all the house of his father with bread, according to the mouth of the infants.
\v 13 And there is no bread in all the land, for the famine is very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan are feeble because of the famine;
\v 14 and Joseph gathereth all the silver that is found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn that they are buying, and Joseph brought the silver into the house of Pharaoh.
\v 15 And the silver is consumed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Canaan, and all the Egyptians come in unto Joseph, saying, 'Give to us bread — why do we die before you, though the money had ceased?'
\v 16 and Joseph said, 'Give your cattle; and I give to you for your cattle, if the money had ceased.'
\v 17 And they bring in their cattle unto Joseph, and Joseph gave to them bread, for the horses, and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd, and for the asses; and he tendeth them with bread, for all their cattle, during that year.
\v 18 And that year is finished, and they come in unto him on the second year, and say to him, 'We do not hide from my lord, that since the money had been finished, and possession of the cattle is unto my lord, there had not been left before my lord save our bodies, and our ground;
\v 19 why do we die before yours eyes, both we and our ground? buy us and our ground for bread, and we and our ground are servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, and we live, and die not, and the ground is not desolate.'
\v 20 And Joseph buyeth all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians have sold each his field, for the famine had been severe upon them, and the land became Pharaoh's;
\v 21 as to the people he had removed them to cities from the one end of the border of Egypt even unto its other end.
\v 22 Only the ground of the priests he had not bought, for the priests have a portion from Pharaoh, and they have eaten their portion which Pharaoh had given to them, therefore they have not sold their ground.
\v 23 And Joseph said unto the people, 'Lo, I have bought you to-day and your ground for Pharaoh; behold, seed for you, and you have sown the ground,
\v 24 and it had come to pass in the increases, that you have given a fifth to Pharaoh, and four of the parts are for yourselves, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those who are in your houses, and for food for your infants.'
\v 25 And they say, 'You hast revived us; we find grace in the eyes of my lord, and have been servants to Pharaoh;'
\v 26 and Joseph setteth it for a statute unto this day, concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh had a fifth; only the ground of the priests alone had not become Pharaoh's.
\v 27 And Israel dwelleth in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they have possession in it, and are fruitful, and multiply exceedingly;
\v 28 and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, are an hundred and forty and seven years.
\v 29 And the days of Israel are near to die, and he called for his son, for Joseph, and said to him, 'If, I pray you, I have found grace in yours eyes, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and you hast done with me kindness and truth; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt,
\v 30 and I have lain with my fathers, and you hast borne me out of Egypt, and buried me in their burying-place.' And he said, 'I — I do according to your word;'
\v 31 and he said, 'Swear to me;' and he sweareth to him, and Israel boweth himself on the head of the bed.
\c 48
\v 1 And it came to pass, after these things, that one said to Joseph, 'Lo, your father is sick;' and he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 2 And one declareth to Jacob, and said, 'Lo, your son Joseph is coming unto you;' and Israel did strengthen himself, and sit upon the bed.
\v 3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, 'God Almighty had appeared unto me, in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\v 4 and said unto me, Lo, I am making you fruitful, and have multiplied you, and given you for an assembly of peoples, and given this land to your seed after you, a possession age-during.
\v 5 And now, your two sons, who are born to you in the land of Egypt, before my coming unto you to Egypt, mine they are; Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon they are mine;
\v 6 and your family which you hast begotten after them are yours; by the name of their brethren they are called in their inheritance.
\v 7 And I — in my coming in from Padan-Aram Rachel had died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, while yet a kibrath of land to enter Ephrata, and I bury her there in the way of Ephrata, which is Bethlehem.'
\v 8 And Israel saw the sons of Joseph, and said, 'Who are these?'
\v 9 and Joseph said unto his father, 'They are my sons, whom God had given to me in this place;' and he said, 'Bring them, I pray you, unto me, and I bless them.'
\v 10 And the eyes of Israel have been heavy from age, he is unable to see; and he brought them nigh unto him, and he kisseth them, and cleaveth to them;
\v 11 and Israel said unto Joseph, 'To see your face I had not thought, and behold, God had showed me also your seed.'
\v 12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and boweth himself on his face to the earth;
\v 13 and Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left, and Manasseh in his left towards Israel's right, and brought them nigh to him.
\v 14 And Israel putteth out his right hand, and placeth it upon the head of Ephraim, who is the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh; he had guided his hands wisely, for Manasseh is the first-born.
\v 15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, 'God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked habitually: God who is feeding me from my being unto this day:
\v 16 the Messenger who is redeeming me from all evil did bless the youths, and my name is called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and they increase into a multitude in the middle of the land.'
\v 17 And Joseph saw that his father setteth his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it is wrong in his eyes, and he supporteth the hand of his father to turn it aside from off the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh;
\v 18 and Joseph said unto his father, 'Not so, my father, for this is the first-born; set your right hand on his head.'
\v 19 And his father refuseth, and said, 'I have known, my son, I have known; he also became a people, and he also is great, and yet, his young brother is greater than he, and his seed is the fulness of the nations;'
\v 20 and he blessed them in that day, saying, 'By you did Israel bless, saying, God set you as Ephraim and as Manasseh;' and he setteth Ephraim before Manasseh.
\v 21 And Israel said unto Joseph, 'Lo, I am dying, and God had been with you, and had brought you back unto the land of your fathers;
\v 22 and I — I have given to you one portion above your brethren, which I have taken out of the hand of the Amorite by my sword and by my bow.'
\c 49
\v 1 And Jacob called unto his sons and said, 'Be gathered together, and I declare to you that which did happen with you in the latter end of the days.
\v 2 'Be assembled, and hear, sons of Jacob, And hearken unto Israel your father.
\v 3 Reuben! my first-born you, My power, and beginning of my strength, The abundance of exaltation, And the abundance of strength;
\v 4 Unstable as water, you are not abundant; For you hast gone up your father's bed; Then you hast polluted: My couch he went up!
\v 5 Simeon and Levi are brethren! Instruments of violence — their espousals!
\v 6 Into their secret, come not, O my soul! Unto their assembly be not united, O mine honour; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will eradicated a prince.
\v 7 Cursed is their anger, for it is fierce, And their wrath, for it is sharp; I divide them in Jacob, And I scatter them in Israel.
\v 8 Judah! you — your brethren praise you! Your hand is on the neck of yours enemies, Sons of your father bow themselves to you.
\v 9 A lion's whelp is Judah, For prey, my son, you hast gone up; He had bent, he had crouched as a lion, And as a lioness; who caused him to arise?
\v 10 The sceptre turneth not aside from Judah, And a lawgiver from between his feet, Till his Seed come; And his is the obedience of peoples.
\v 11 Binding to the vine his ass, And to the choice vine the colt of his ass, He had washed in wine his clothing, And in the blood of grapes his covering;
\v 12 Red are eyes with wine, And white are teeth with milk!
\v 13 Zebulun at a haven of the seas did dwell, And he is for a haven of ships; And his side is unto Zidon.
\v 14 Issacher is a strong ass, Crouching between the two folds;
\v 15 And he saw rest that it is good, And the land that it is pleasant, And he inclineth his shoulder to bear, And is to tribute a servant.
\v 16 Dan did judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel;
\v 17 Dan is a serpent by the way, An adder by the path, Which is biting the horse's heels, And its rider falleth backward.
\v 18 For Your salvation I have waited, Yahweh!
\v 19 Gad! a troop assaulteth him, But he assaulteth last.
\v 20 Out of Asher his bread is fat; And he gave dainties of a king.
\v 21 Naphtali is a hind sent away, Who is giving beauteous young ones.
\v 22 Joseph is a fruitful son; A fruitful son by a fountain, Daughters step over the wall;
\v 23 And embitter him — yea, they have striven, Yea, hate him do archers;
\v 24 And his bow abideth in strength, And strengthened are the arms of his hands By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, Whence is a shepherd, a son of Israel.
\v 25 By the God of your father who helpeth you, And the Mighty One who blessed you, Blessings of the heavens from above, Blessings of the deep lying under, Blessings of breasts and womb; — 
\v 26 Your father's blessings have been mighty Above the blessings of my progenitors, Unto the limit of the heights age-during They are for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of the one Separate from his brethren.
\v 27 Benjamin! a wolf tears; In the morning he eateth prey, And at evening he apportioneth spoil.'
\v 28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is that which their father had spoken unto them, and he blessed them; each according to his blessing he had blessed them.
\v 29 And he commandeth them, and said unto them, 'I am being gathered unto my people; bury me by my fathers, at the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite;
\v 30 in the cave which is in the field of Machpelah, which is on the front of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place;
\v 31 (there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah);
\v 32 the purchase of the field and of the cave which is in it, is from Sons of Heth.'
\v 33 And Jacob finisheth commanding his sons, and gathereth up his feet unto the bed, and expireth, and is gathered unto his people.
\c 50
\v 1 And Joseph falleth on his father's face, and weepeth over him, and kisseth him;
\v 2 and Joseph commandeth his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father, and the physicians embalm Israel;
\v 3 and they fulfil for him forty days, for so they fulfil the days of the embalmed, and the Egyptians weep for him seventy days.
\v 4 And the days of his weeping pass away, and Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, 'If, I pray you, I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\v 5 My father caused me to swear, saying, Lo, I am dying; in my burying-place which I have prepared for myself in the land of Canaan, there will you bury me; and now, let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and return;'
\v 6 and Pharaoh said, 'Go up and bury your father, as he caused you to swear.'
\v 7 And Joseph went up to bury his father, and go up with him do all the servants of Pharaoh, elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\v 8 and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and the house of his father; only their infants, and their flock, and their herd, have they left in the land of Goshen;
\v 9 and there go up with him both chariot and horsemen, and the camp is very great.
\v 10 And they come unto the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and they lament there, a lamentation great and very grievous; and he made for his father a mourning seven days,
\v 11 and the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, see the mourning in the threshing-floor of Atad, and say, 'A grievous mourning is this to the Egyptians;' therefore had one called its name 'The mourning of the Egyptians,' which is beyond the Jordan.
\v 12 And his sons do to him so as he commanded them,
\v 13 and his sons bear him away to the land of Canaan, and bury him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place, from Ephron the Hittite, on the front of Mamre.
\v 14 And Joseph turneth back to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all who are going up with him to bury his father, after his burying his father.
\v 15 And the brethren of Joseph see that their father is dead, and say, 'Peradventure Joseph did hate us, and did certainly return to us all the evil which we did with him.'
\v 16 And they give a charge for Joseph, saying, 'Your father commanded before his death, saying,
\v 17 Thus you do say to Joseph, I pray you, bear, I pray you, with the transgression of your brethren, and their sin, for they have done you evil; and now, bear, we pray you, with the transgression of the servants of the God of your father;' and Joseph weepeth in their speaking unto him.
\v 18 And his brethren also go and fall before him, and say, 'Lo, we are to you for servants.'
\v 19 And Joseph said unto them, 'Fear not, for am I in the place of God?
\v 20 As for you, you devised against me evil — God devised it for good, in order to do as at this day, to keep alive a numerous people;
\v 21 and now, fear not: I do nourish you and your infants;' and he comforteth them, and spoke unto their heart.
\v 22 And Joseph dwelleth in Egypt, he and the house of his father, and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years,
\v 23 and Joseph looketh on Ephraim's sons of the third generation; sons also of Machir, son of Manasseh, have been born on the knees of Joseph.
\v 24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, 'I am dying, and God did certainly inspect you, and had caused you to go up from this land, unto the land which He had sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.'
\v 25 And Joseph caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, 'God did certainly inspect you, and you have brought up my bones from this place.'
\v 26 And Joseph dieth, a son of an hundred and ten years, and they embalm him, and he is put into a coffin in Egypt.
