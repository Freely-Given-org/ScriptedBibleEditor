\v 1 And king David is old, entering into days, and they cover him with garments, and he had no heat,
\v 2 and his servants say to him, 'Let them seek for my lord the king a young woman, a virgin, and she had stood before the king, and is to him a companion, and had lain in your bosom, and my lord the king had heat.'
\v 3 And they seek a fair young woman in all the border of Israel, and find Abishag the Shunammite, and bring her in to the king,
\v 4 and the young woman is very very fair, and she is to the king a companion, and serveth him, and the king had not known her.
\v 5 And Adonijah son of Haggith is lifting himself up, saying, 'I do reign;' and he prepared for himself a chariot and horsemen, and fifty men running before him,
\v 6 and his father had not grieved him all his days, saying, 'Wherefore thus hast you done?' and he also is of a very good form, and his mother bare him after Absalom.
\v 7 And his words are with Joab son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest, and they help after Adonijah;
\v 8 and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty ones whom David had, have not been with Adonijah.
\v 9 And Adonijah sacrificeth sheep and oxen and fatlings near the stone of Zoheleth, that is by En-Rogel, and called all his brethren, sons of the king, and for all the men of Judah, servants of the king;
\v 10 and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty ones, and Solomon his brother, he had not called.
\v 11 And Nathan spoke unto Bath-Sheba, mother of Solomon, saying, 'Hast you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith had reigned, and our lord David had not known?
\v 12 and now, come, let me counsel thee, I pray thee, and deliver your life, and the life of your son Solomon;
\v 13 go and enter in unto king David, and you hast said unto him, Hast you not, my lord, O king, sworn to your handmaid, saying, Surely Solomon your son did reign after me, and he did sit on my throne? and wherefore had Adonijah reigned?
\v 14 Lo, you are yet speaking there with the king, and I come in after thee, and have completed your words.'
\v 15 And Bath-Sheba came in unto the king, to the inner chamber, and the king is very aged, and Abishag the Shunammite is serving the king:
\v 16 and Bath-Sheba boweth and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, 'What — to thee?'
\v 17 And she said to him, 'My lord, you hast sworn by Yahweh your God to your handmaid: Surely Solomon your son did reign after me, and he did sit on my throne;
\v 18 and now, lo, Adonijah had reigned, and now, my lord, O king, you hast not known;
\v 19 and he sacrificeth ox, and fatling, and sheep in abundance, and called for all the sons of the king, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab head of the host — and for Solomon your servant he had not called.
\v 20 And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on thee, to declare to them who did sit on the throne of my lord the king after him;
\v 21 and it had been, when my lord the king lieth with his fathers, that I have been, I and my son Solomon — reckoned sinners.'
\v 22 And lo, she is yet speaking with the king, and Nathan the prophet had come in;
\v 23 and they declare to the king, saying, 'Lo, Nathan the prophet;' and he came in before the king, and boweth himself to the king, on his face to the earth.
\v 24 And Nathan said, 'My lord, O king, you hast said, Adonijah did reign after me, and he did sit on my throne;
\v 25 for he had gone down to-day, and did sacrifice ox, and fatling, and sheep, in abundance, and called for all the sons of the king, and for the heads of the host, and for Abiathar the priest, and lo, they are eating and drinking before him, and they say, Let king Adonijah live!
\v 26 And for me — me, your servant, and for Zadok the priest, and for Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and for Solomon your servant, he had not called;
\v 27 if from my lord the king this thing had been, then you hast not caused your servant to know who did sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.'
\v 28 And king David answereth and said, 'Call for me for Bath-Sheba;' and she came in before the king, and standeth before the king.
\v 29 And the king sweareth and said, 'Yahweh lived, who had redeemed my soul out of all adversity;
\v 30 surely as I sware to thee by Yahweh, God of Israel, saying, Surely Solomon your son did reign after me, and he did sit on my throne in my stead; surely so I do this day.'
\v 31 And Bath-Sheba boweth — face to the earth — and did obeisance to the king, and said, 'Let my lord, king David, live to the age.'
\v 32 And king David said, 'Call for me for Zadok the priest, and for Nathan the prophet, and for Benaiah son of Jehoiada;' and they come in before the king.
\v 33 And the king said to them, 'Take with you the servants of your lord, and ye have caused Solomon my son to ride on mine own mule, and caused him to go down unto Gihon,
\v 34 and anointed him there had Zadok the priest — and Nathan the prophet — for king over Israel, and ye have blown with a trumpet, and said, Let king Solomon live;
\v 35 and ye have come up after him, and he had come in and had sat on my throne, and he did reign in my stead, and him I have appointed to be leader over Israel, and over Judah.'
\v 36 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada answereth the king, and said, 'Amen! so did Yahweh, God of my lord the king, say;
\v 37 as Yahweh had been with my lord the king, so is He with Solomon, and did make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.'
\v 38 And Zadok the priest went down, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite, and they cause Solomon to ride on the mule of king David, and cause him to go unto Gihon,
\v 39 and Zadok the priest taketh the horn of oil out of the tent, and anointeth Solomon, and they blow with a trumpet, and all the people say, 'Let king Solomon live.'
\v 40 And all the people come up after him, and the people are piping with pipes, and rejoicing — great joy, and the earth rendeth with their voice.
\v 41 And Adonijah heareth, and all those called, who are with him, and they have finished to eat, and Joab heareth the noise of the trumpet, and said, 'Wherefore is the noise of the city roaring?'
\v 42 He is yet speaking, and lo, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest had come in, and Adonijah said, 'Come in, for a man of valour you art, and you bearest good tidings.'
\v 43 And Jonathan answereth and said to Adonijah, 'Verily our lord king David had caused Solomon to reign,
\v 44 and the king sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethite, and the Pelethite, and they cause him to ride on the king's mule,
\v 45 and they anoint him — Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet — for king in Gihon, and are come up there rejoicing, and the city is moved; it is the noise that ye have heard.
\v 46 'And also Solomon had sat on the throne of the kingdom,
\v 47 and also the servants of the king have come into bless our lord king David, saying, Your God did make the name of Solomon better than your name, and his throne greater than your throne; and the king boweth himself on the bed,
\v 48 and also thus had the king said, Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, who had given to-day one sitting on my throne, and mine eyes seeing.'
\v 49 And they tremble, and rise — all those called who are for Adonijah — and go, each on his way;
\v 50 and Adonijah feareth because of Solomon, and riseth, and went, and laid hold on the horns of the altar.
\v 51 And it is declared to Solomon, saying, 'Lo, Adonijah feareth king Solomon, and lo, he had laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me as to-day — he did not put to death his servant by the sword.'
\v 52 And Solomon said, 'If he became a virtuous man — there did not fall of his hair to the earth, and if evil is found in him — then he had died.'
\v 53 And king Solomon sent, and they bring him down from off the altar, and he came in and boweth himself to king Solomon, and Solomon said to him, 'Go to your house.'
\c 2
\v 1 And draw near do the days of David to die, and he chargeth Solomon his son, saying,
\v 2 'I am going in the way of all the earth, and you hast been strong, and become a man,
\v 3 and kept the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commands, and His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you will wisely all that you will, and whithersoever you turnest,
\v 4 so that Yahweh did establish His word which He spake unto me, saying, If your sons observe their way to walk before Me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul; saying, There is not cut off a man of yours from the throne of Israel.
\v 5 And also, you hast known that which he did to me — Joab son of Zeruiah — that which he did to two heads of the hosts of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether — that he slaid them, and made the blood of war in peace, and putteth the blood of war in his girdle, that is on his loins, and in his sandals that are on his feet;
\v 6 and you hast done according to your wisdom, and will not let his old age go down in peace to Sheol.
\v 7 'And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite you will do kindness, and they have been among those eating at your table, for so they drew near unto me in my fleeing from the face of Absalom your brother.
\v 8 And lo, with thee is Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim, and he reviled me — a grievous reviling — in the day of my going to Mahanaim; and he had come down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swear to him by Yahweh, saying, I do not put thee to death by the sword;
\v 9 and now, acquit him not, for a wise man you art, and you hast known that which you will to him, and hast brought down his old age with blood to Sheol.'
\v 10 And David lieth down with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David,
\v 11 and the days that David had reigned over Israel are forty years, in Hebron he had reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he had reigned thirty and three years.
\v 12 And Solomon had sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom is established greatly,
\v 13 and Adonijah son of Haggith came in unto Bath-Sheba, mother of Solomon, and she said, 'Is your coming peace?' and he said, 'Peace.'
\v 14 And he said, 'I have a word unto thee,' and she said, 'Speak.'
\v 15 And he said, 'Thou hast known that the kingdom was mine, and towards me set their faces had all Israel for reigning, and the kingdom is turned round about, and is my brother's, for from Yahweh it was his;
\v 16 and now, one petition I am asking of thee — turn not back my face;' and she said unto him, 'Speak.'
\v 17 And he said, 'Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, for he did not turn back your face, and he did give to me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.'
\v 18 And Bath-Sheba said, 'Good; I do speak for thee unto the king.'
\v 19 And Bath-Sheba came in unto king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, and the king riseth to meet her, and boweth himself to her, and sitteth on his throne, and placeth a throne for the mother of the king, and she sitteth at his right hand.
\v 20 And she said, 'One small petition I ask of thee, turn not back my face;' and the king said to her, 'Ask, my mother, for I do not turn back your face.'
\v 21 And she said, 'Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother for a wife.'
\v 22 And king Solomon answereth and said to his mother, 'And why art you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? also ask for him the kingdom — for he is mine elder brother — even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah.'
\v 23 And king Solomon sweareth by Yahweh, saying, 'Thus did God to me, and thus He did add — surely against his soul had Adonijah spoken this word;
\v 24 and now, Yahweh lived, who had established me, and caused me to sit on the throne of David my father, and who had made for me an house as He spake — surely to-day is Adonijah put to death.'
\v 25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he falleth upon him, and he dieth.
\v 26 And to Abiathar the priest said the king, 'To Anathoth go, unto your fields; for a man of death you art, but in this day I do not put thee to death, because you hast borne the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you wast afflicted in all that my father was afflicted in.'
\v 27 And Solomon threw out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, to fulfil the word of Yahweh which He spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\v 28 And the report had come unto Joab — for Joab had turned aside after Adonijah, yough after Absalom he did not turn aside — and Joab fleeth unto the tent of Yahweh, and laid hold on the horns of the altar.
\v 29 And it is declared to king Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tent of Yahweh, and lo, near the altar; and Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, 'Go, fall upon him.'
\v 30 And Benaiah came in unto the tent of Yahweh, and said unto him, 'Thus said the king, Come out;' and he said, 'Nay, but here I die.' And Benaiah brought back the king word, saying, 'Thus spake Joab, yea, thus he answered me.'
\v 31 And the king said to him, 'Do as he had spoken, and fall upon him, and you hast buried him, and turned aside the causeless blood which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the house of my father;
\v 32 and Yahweh had turned back his blood on his own head, who had fallen on two men more righteous and better than he, and slaid them with the sword, — and my father David knew not — Abner son of Ner, head of the host of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, head of the host of Judah;
\v 33 yea, turned back had their blood on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed to the age; and for David, and for his seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there is peace unto the age, from Yahweh.'
\v 34 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and falleth upon him, and putteth him to death, and he is buried in his own house in the wilderness,
\v 35 and the king putteth Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host, and Zadok the priest had the king put in the stead of Abiathar.
\v 36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, 'Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and you hast dwelt there, and will not go out there any where;
\v 37 and it had been, in the day of your going out, and you hast passed over the brook Kidron, you will certainly know that you will surely die — your blood is on your head.'
\v 38 And Shimei said to the king, 'The word is good; as my lord the king had spoken so did your servant do;' and Shimei dwelleth in Jerusalem many days.
\v 39 And it came to pass, at the end of three years, that flee do two of the servants of Shimei unto Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath, and they declare to Shimei, saying, 'Lo, your servants are in Gath;'
\v 40 and Shimei riseth, and saddleth his ass, and went to Gath, unto Achish, to seek his servants, and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
\v 41 And it is declared to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and did return,
\v 42 and the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, 'Have I not caused thee to swear by Yahweh — and I testify against thee, saying, In the day of your going out, and you hast gone anywhere, you will certainly know that you will surely die; and you sayest unto me, The word I have heard is good?
\v 43 and wherefore hast you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the charge that I charged upon thee?'
\v 44 And the king said unto Shimei, 'Thou hast known all the evil that your heart had known, which you did to David my father, and Yahweh had turned back yours evil on your head,
\v 45 and king Solomon is blessed, and the throne of David is established before Yahweh unto the age.'
\v 46 And the king chargeth Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and falleth on him, and he dieth, and the kingdom is established in the hand of Solomon.

\v 1 And Solomon joineth in marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and taketh the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought her in unto the city of David, till he completed to build his own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\v 2 Only, the people are sacrificing in high places, for there had not been built a house for the name of Yahweh till those days.
\v 3 And Solomon loveth Yahweh, to walk in the statutes of David his father — only, in high places he is sacrificing and making perfume — 
\v 4 and the king went to Gibeon, to sacrifice there, for it is the great high place; a yousand burnt-offerings cause to ascend did Solomon on that altar.
\v 5 In Gibeon had Yahweh appeared unto Solomon, in a dream of the night, and God said, 'Ask — what do I give to thee?'
\v 6 And Solomon said, 'Thou hast done with Your servant David my father great kindness, as he walked before Thee in truth and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee, and Thou will keep for him this great kindness, and will give to him a son sitting on his throne, as at this day.
\v 7 And now, O Yahweh my God, Thou hast caused your servant to reign instead of David my father; and I am a little child, I do not know to go out and to come in;
\v 8 and Your servant is in the middle of your people, whom Thou hast chosen, a people numerous, that is not numbered nor counted for multitude,
\v 9 and Thou hast given to Your servant an understanding heart, to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Your great people?'
\v 10 And the thing is good in the eyes of the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing,
\v 11 and God said unto him, 'Because that you hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thee many days, nor asked for thee riches, nor asked the life of yours enemies, and hast asked for thee discernment to understand judgment,
\v 12 lo, I have done according to your words; lo, I have given to thee a heart, wise and understanding, that like thee there had not been before thee, and after thee there did not arise like thee;
\v 13 and also, that which you hast not asked I have given to thee, both riches and honour, that there had not been like thee a man among the kings all your days;
\v 14 and if you will walk in My ways to keep My statutes, and My commands, as David your father walked, then I have prolonged your days.'
\v 15 And Solomon awaketh, and lo, a dream; and he came in to Jerusalem, and standeth before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and caused to ascend burnt-offerings, and made peace-offerings. And he made a banquet for all his servants,
\v 16 then come in do two women, harlots, unto the king, and stand before him,
\v 17 and the one woman said, 'O, my lord, I and this woman are dwelling in one house, and I bring forth with her, in the house;
\v 18 and it came to pass on the third day of my bringing forth, that this woman also brought forth, and we are together, there is no stranger with us in the house, save we two, in the house.
\v 19 And the son of this woman dieth at night, because she had lain upon it,
\v 20 and she riseth in the middle of the night, and taketh my son from beside me — and your handmaid is asleep — and laid it in her bosom, and her dead son she had laid in my bosom;
\v 21 and I rise in the morning to suckle my son, and lo, dead; and I consider concerning it in the morning, and lo, it was not my son whom I did bear.'
\v 22 And the other woman said, 'Nay, but my son is the living, and your son the dead;' and this one said, 'Nay, but your son is the dead, and my son the living.' And they speak before the king.
\v 23 And the king said, 'This one said, This is my son, the living, and your son is the dead; and that one said, Nay, but your son is the dead, and my son the living.'
\v 24 And the king said, 'Take for me a sword;' and they bring the sword before the king,
\v 25 and the king said, 'Cut the living child into two, and give the half to the one, and the half to the other.'
\v 26 And the woman whose son is the living one said unto the king (for her bowels yearned over her son), yea, she said, 'O, my lord, give to her the living child, and put it not at all to death;' and this one said, 'Let it be neither mine or yours — cut it.'
\v 27 And the king answereth and said, 'Give ye to her the living child, and put it not at all to death; she is its mother.'
\v 28 And all Israel hear of the judgment that the king had judged, and fear because of the king, for they have seen that the wisdom of God is in his heart, to do judgment.

\v 1 And king Solomon is king over all Israel,
\v 2 and these are the heads whom he had: Azariah son of Zadok is the priest;
\v 3 Elihoreph and Ahiah sons of Shisha are scribes; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud is remembrancer;
\v 4 and Benaiah son of Jehoiada is over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar are priests;
\v 5 and Azariah son of Nathan is over the officers; and Zabud son of Nathan is minister, friend of the king;
\v 6 And Ahishar is over the household, and Adoniram son of Abda is over the tribute.
\v 7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, and they have sustained the king and his household — a month in the year is on each one for sustenance;
\v 8 and these are their names: Ben-Hur in the hill-country of Ephraim;
\v 9 Ben-Dekar in Makaz, and Shaalbim, and Beth-Shemesh, and Elon-Beth-Hanan.
\v 10 Ben-Hesed is in Aruboth, had Sochoh and all the land of Hepher;
\v 11 Ben-Abinadab had all the elevation of Dor, Taphad daughter of Solomon became his wife.
\v 12 Baana Ben-Ahilud had Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-Shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-Shean unto Abel-Meholah, unto beyond Jokneam.
\v 13 Ben-Geber, in Ramoth-Gilead, had the small towns of Jair son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; he had a portion of Argob that is in Bashan, sixty great cities with wall and brazen bar.
\v 14 Ahinadab son of Iddo had Mahanaim.
\v 15 Ahimaaz is in Naphtali; he also had taken Basemath daughter of Solomon for a wife.
\v 16 Baanah Ben-Hushai is in Asher, and in Aloth.
\v 17 Jehoshaphat Ben-Paruah is in Issachar.
\v 18 Shimei Ben-Elah is in Benjamin.
\v 19 Geber Ben-Uri is in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon king of the Amorite, and of Og king of Bashan: and one officer who is in the land.
\v 20 Judah and Israel are many, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.
\v 21 And Solomon had been ruling over all the kingdoms, from the River to the land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt: they are bringing nigh a present, and serving Solomon, all days of his life.
\v 22 And the provision of Solomon for one day is thirty cors of flour, and sixty cors of meal;
\v 23 ten fat oxen, and twenty feeding oxen, and a hundred sheep, apart from hart, and roe, and fallow-deer, and fatted beasts of the stalls,
\v 24 for he is ruling over all beyond the river, from Tiphsah and unto Gaza, over all the kings beyond the river, and he had peace from all his servants round about.
\v 25 And Judah dwelleth — and Israel — in confidence, each under his vine, and under his fig-tree, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, all the days of Solomon.
\v 26 And Solomon had forty yousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve yousand horsemen.
\v 27 And these officers have sustained king Solomon and every one drawing near unto the table of king Solomon, each in his month; they let nothing be lacking.
\v 28 And the barley and the straw, for horses and for dromedaries, they bring in unto the place where they are, each according to his ordinance.
\v 29 And God gave wisdom to Solomon, and understanding, very much, and breadth of heart, as the sand that is on the edge of the sea;
\v 30 and the wisdom of Solomon is greater than the wisdom of any of the sons of the east, and than all the wisdom of Egypt;
\v 31 and he is wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, sons of Mahol, and his name is in all the nations round about.
\v 32 And he spoke three yousand similes, and his songs are five, and the chief one;
\v 33 and he spoke concerning the trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that is coming out in the wall, and he spoke concerning the cattle, and concerning the fowl, and concerning the creeping things, and concerning the fishes,
\v 34 and there come out of all the peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth who have heard of his wisdom.
\c 5
\v 1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon, for he heard that they had anointed him for king instead of his father, for Hiram was a lover of David all the days;
\v 2 and Solomon sent unto Hiram, saying,
\v 3 'Thou hast known David my father, that he had not been able to build a house to the name of Yahweh his God, because of the wars that have been round about him, till Yahweh's putting them under the soles of his feet.
\v 4 'And now, Yahweh my God had given rest to me round about, there is no adversary nor evil occurrence,
\v 5 and lo, I am saying to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spake unto David my father, saying, Your son whom I appoint in your stead on your throne, he did build the house for My name.
\v 6 'And now, command, and they cut down for me cedars out of Lebanon, and my servants are with your servants, and the hire of your servants I give to thee according to all that you sayest, for you hast known that there is not among us a man acquainted with cutting wood, like the Sidonians.'
\v 7 And it came to pass at Hiram's hearing the words of Solomon, that he rejoiceth exceedingly, and said, 'Blessed is Yahweh to-day, who had given to David a wise son over this numerous people.'
\v 8 And Hiram sent unto Solomon, saying, I have heard that which you hast sent unto me, I do all your desire concerning cedar-wood, and fir-wood,
\v 9 my servants bring down from Lebanon to the sea, and I make them floats in the sea unto the place that you sendest unto me, and I have spread them out there; and you will take them up, and you will execute my desire, to give the food of my house.'
\v 10 And Hiram is giving to Solomon cedar-trees, and fir-trees, all his desire,
\v 11 and Solomon had given to Hiram twenty yousand cors of wheat, food for his house, and twenty cors of beaten oil; thus did Solomon give to Hiram year by year.
\v 12 And Yahweh had given wisdom to Solomon as He spake to him, and there is peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they make a covenant both of them.
\v 13 And king Solomon lifteth up a tribute out of all Israel, and the tribute is thirty yousand men,
\v 14 and he sent them to Lebanon, ten yousand a month, by changes, a month they are in Lebanon, two months in their own house; and Adoniram is over the tribute.
\v 15 And king Solomon had seventy yousand bearing burdens, and eighty yousand hewing in the mountain,
\v 16 apart from the heads of the officers of Solomon, who are over the work, three yousand and three hundred, those ruling over the people who are working in the business.
\v 17 And the king commandeth, and they bring great stones, precious stone, to lay the foundation of the house, hewn stones;
\v 18 and the builders of Solomon, and the builders of Hiram, and the Giblites hew, and prepare the wood and the stones to build the house.
\c 6
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the four hundred and eightieth year of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year — in the month of Zif, it is the second month — of the reigning of Solomon over Israel, that he built the house for Yahweh.
\v 2 As to the house that king Solomon had built for Yahweh, sixty cubits is its length, and twenty its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.
\v 3 As to the porch on the front of the temple of the house, twenty cubits is its length on the front of the breadth of the house; ten by the cubit is its breadth on the front of the house;
\v 4 and he made for the house windows of narrow lights.
\v 5 And he built against the wall of the house a couch round about, even the walls of the house round about, of the temple and of the oracle, and made sides round about.
\v 6 The lowest couch, five by the cubit is its breadth; and the middle, six by the cubit is its breadth; and the third, seven by the cubit is its breadth, for withdrawings he had put to the house round about, wiyout — not to lay hold on the walls of the house.
\v 7 And the house, in its being built, of perfect stone brought thither had been built, and hammer, and the axe — any instrument of iron — was not heard in the house, in its being built.
\v 8 The opening of the middle side is at the right shoulder of the house, and with windings they go up on the middle one, and from the middle one unto the third.
\v 9 And he built the house, and completed it, and covereth the house with beams and rows of cedars.
\v 10 And he built the couch against all the house, five cubits is its height, and it taketh hold of the house by cedar-wood.
\v 11 And the word of Yahweh is unto Solomon, saying,
\v 12 This house that you art building — if you will walk in My statutes, and My judgments will do, yea, hast done all My commands, to walk in them, then I have established My word with thee, which I spake unto David your father,
\v 13 and have tabernacled in the middle of the sons of Israel, and do not forsake My people Israel.'
\v 14 And Solomon built the house and completed it;
\v 15 and he built the walls of the house within with beams of cedar, from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling; he had overlaid with wood the inside, and covereth the floor of the house with ribs of fir.
\v 16 And he built the twenty cubits on the sides of the house with ribs of cedar, from the floor unto the walls; and he built for it within, for the oracle, for the holy of holies.
\v 17 And forty by the cubit was the house, it is the temple before it.
\v 18 And the cedar for the house within is carvings of knobs and openings of flowers; the whole is cedar, there is not a stone seen.
\v 19 And the oracle in the middle of the house within he had prepared, to put there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
\v 20 And before the oracle is twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits is its height; and he overlaid it with gold refined, and overlaid the altar with cedar.
\v 21 And Solomon overlaid the house within with gold refined, and caused it to pass over in chains of gold before the oracle, and overlaid it with gold.
\v 22 And the whole of the house he had overlaid with gold, till the completion of all the house; and the whole of the altar that the oracle had, he had overlaid with gold.
\v 23 And he made within the oracle two cherubs, of the oil-tree, ten cubits is their height;
\v 24 and five cubits is the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub, ten cubits from the ends of its wings even unto the ends of its wings;
\v 25 and ten by the cubit is the second cherub, one measure and one form are to the two cherubs,
\v 26 the height of the one cherub is ten by the cubit, and so is the second cherub;
\v 27 and he setteth the cherubs in the middle of the inner house, and they spread out the wings of the cherubs, and a wing of the one came against the wall, and a wing of the second cherub is coming against the second wall, and their wings are unto the middle of the house, coming wing against wing;
\v 28 and he overlaid the cherubs with gold,
\v 29 and all the walls of the house round about he had carved with openings of carvings, cherubs, and palm trees, and openings of flowers, within and wiyout.
\v 30 And the floor of the house he had overlaid with gold, within and wiyout;
\v 31 as to the opening of the oracle, he made doors of the oil-tree; the lintel, side-posts, a fifth.
\v 32 And the two doors are of the oil-tree, and he had carved upon them carvings of cherubs, and palm-trees, and openings of flowers, and overlaid with gold, and he caused the gold to go down on the cherubs and on the palm-trees.
\v 33 And so he had made for the opening of the temple, side-posts of the oil-tree, from the fourth.
\v 34 And the two doors are of fir-tree, the two sides of the one door are revolving, and the two hangings of the second door are revolving.
\v 35 And he had carved cherubs, and palms, and openings of flowers, and overlaid with straightened gold the graved work.
\v 36 And he built the inner court, three rows of hewn work, and a row of beams of cedar.
\v 37 In the fourth year had the house of Yahweh been founded, in the month Zif,
\v 38 and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul — that is the eighth month — had the house been finished in all its matters, and in all its ordinances, and he built it seven years.
\c 7
\v 1 And his own house had Solomon built thirteen years, and he finisheth all his house.
\v 2 And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; a hundred cubits is its length, and fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height, on four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar-beams on the pillars;
\v 3 and it is covered with cedar above, on the sides that are on the forty and five pillars, fifteen in the row.
\v 4 And windows are in three rows, and sight is over-against sight three times.
\v 5 And all the openings and the side-posts are square — windows; and sight is over-against sight three times.
\v 6 And the porch of the pillars he had made; fifty cubits its length, and thirty cubits its breadth, and the porch is before them, and pillars and a thick place are before them.
\v 7 And the porch of the throne where he judgeth — the porch of judgment — he had made, and it is covered with cedar from the floor unto the floor.
\v 8 As to his house where he dwelleth, the other court is within the porch — as this work it had been; and a house he made for the daughter of Pharaoh — whom Solomon had taken — like this porch.
\v 9 All these are of precious stone, according to the measures of hewn work, sawn with a saw, within and wiyout, even from the foundation unto the coping, and at the outside, unto the great court.
\v 10 And the foundation is of precious stone, great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits;
\v 11 and above are precious stone, according to the measures of hewn work, and cedar;
\v 12 and the great court round about is three rows of hewn work, and a row of cedar-beams, even for the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and for the porch of the house.
\v 13 And king Solomon sent and taketh Hiram out of Tyre — 
\v 14 he is son of a woman, a widow, of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and he is filled with the wisdom and the understanding, and the knowledge to do all work in brass — and he came unto king Solomon, and did all his work.
\v 15 And he formed the two pillars of brass; eighteen cubits is the height of the one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits did compass the second pillar.
\v 16 And two chapiters he had made to put on the tops of the pillars, cast in brass; five cubits the height of the one chapiter, and five cubits the height of the second chapiter.
\v 17 Nets of net-work, wreaths of chain-work are for the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars, seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the second chapiter.
\v 18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one net-work, to cover the chapiters that are on the top, with the pomegranates, and so he had made for the second chapiter.
\v 19 And the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars are of lily-work in the porch, four cubits;
\v 20 and the chapiters on the two pillars also above, over-against the protuberance that is beside the net; and the pomegranates are two hundred, in rows round about on the second chapiter.
\v 21 And he raiseth up the pillars for the porch of the temple, and he raiseth up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin, and he raiseth up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz;
\v 22 and on the top of the pillars is lily-work; and the work of the pillars is completed.
\v 23 And he made the molten sea, ten by the cubit from its edge unto its edge; it is round all about, and five by the cubit is its height, and a line of thirty by the cubit did compass it round about;
\v 24 and knops beneath its brim round about are compassing it, ten by the cubit, going round the sea round about; in two rows are the knops, cast in its being cast.
\v 25 It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east, and the sea is upon them above, and all their hinder parts are inward.
\v 26 And its thickness is an handbreadth, and its edge as the work of the edge of a cup, flowers of lilies; two yousand baths it containeth.
\v 27 And he made the ten bases of brass; four by the cubit is the length of the one base, and four by the cubit its breadth, and three by the cubit its height.
\v 28 And this is the work of the base: they have borders, and the borders are between the joinings;
\v 29 and on the borders that are between the joinings are lions, oxen, and cherubs, and on the joinings a base above, and beneath the lions and the oxen are additions — sloping work.
\v 30 And four wheels of brass are to the one base, and axles of brass; and its four corners have shoulders — under the laver are the molten shoulders, beside each addition.
\v 31 And its mouth within the chapiter and above is by the cubit, and its mouth is round, the work of the base, a cubit and half a cubit; and also on its mouth are carvings and their borders, square, not round.
\v 32 And the four wheels are under the borders, and the spokes of the wheels are in the base, and the height of the one wheel is a cubit and half a cubit.
\v 33 And the work of the wheels is as the work of the wheel of a chariot, their spokes, and their axles, and their felloes, and their naves; the whole is molten.
\v 34 And four shoulders are unto the four corners of the one base; out of the base are its shoulders.
\v 35 And in the top of the base is the half of a cubit in the height all round about; and on the top of the base its spokes and its borders are of the same.
\v 36 And he opened on the tablets of its spokes, and on its borders, cherubs, lions, and palm-trees, according to the void space of each, and additions round about.
\v 37 Thus he had made the ten bases; one casting, one measure, one form, have they all.
\v 38 And he made ten lavers of brass; forty baths did the one laver contain, four by the cubit is the one laver, one laver on the one base is to the ten bases;
\v 39 and he putteth the five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house, and the sea he had put on the right side of the house, eastward — over-against the south.
\v 40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the bowls; and Hiram completed to do all the work that he made for king Solomon, for the house of Yahweh;
\v 41 pillars two, and bowls of the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars two, and the nets two, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars;
\v 42 and the pomegranates four hundred for the two nets, two rows of pomegranates for the one net, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that are on the front of the pillars;
\v 43 and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;
\v 44 and the one sea, the twelve oxen under the sea,
\v 45 and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls; and all these vessels, that Hiram had made to king Solomon for the house of Yahweh, are of brass — polished.
\v 46 In the circuit of the Jordan had the king cast them, in the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zarthan.
\v 47 And Solomon placeth the whole of the vessels; because of the very great abundance, the weight of the brass had not been searched out.
\v 48 And Solomon made all the vessels that are in the house of Yahweh: the altar of gold, and the table — on which is the bread of the Presence — of gold,
\v 49 and the candlesticks, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle, of refined gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,
\v 50 and the basins, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the censers, of refined gold, and the hinges for the doors of the inner-house, for the holy of holies, for the doors of the house of the temple, of gold.
\v 51 And it is complete — all the work that king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, and Solomon brought in the sanctified things of David his father; the silver, and the gold, and the vessels he had put in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.
\c 8
\v 1 Then did Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, unto king Solomon, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David — it is Zion;
\v 2 and all the men of Israel are assembled unto king Solomon, in the month of Ethanim, in the festival — is the seventh month.
\v 3 And all the elders of Israel come in, and the priests lift up the ark,
\v 4 and bring up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that are in the tent, yea, the priests and the Levites bring them up.
\v 5 And king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are met unto him are with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that are not counted nor numbered for multitude.
\v 6 And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;
\v 7 for the cherubs are spreading forth two wings unto the place of the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its staves from above;
\v 8 and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves are seen from the holy place on the front of the oracle, and are not seen wiyout, and they are there unto this day.
\v 9 There is nothing in the ark, only the two tables of stone which Moses put there in Horeb, when Yahweh covenanted with the sons of Israel in their going out of the land of Egypt.
\v 10 And it came to pass, in the going out of the priests from the holy place, that the cloud had filled the house of Yahweh,
\v 11 and the priests have not been able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the honour of Yahweh had filled the house of Yahweh.
\v 12 Then said Solomon, 'Yahweh had said to dwell in thick darkness;
\v 13 I have surely built a house of habitation for Thee; a fixed place for Thine abiding to the ages.'
\v 14 And the king turneth round his face, and blessed the whole assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel is standing.
\v 15 And he said, 'Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, who spake by His mouth with David my father, and by His hand had fulfilled it, saying,
\v 16 From the day that I brought out My people, even Israel, from Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house for My name being there; and I fix on David to be over My people Israel.
\v 17 'And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, God of Israel,
\v 18 and Yahweh said unto David my father, Because that it had been with your heart to build a house for My name, you hast done well that it had been with your heart;
\v 19 only, you will not build the house, but your son who is coming out from your loins, he did build the house for My name.
\v 20 'And Yahweh did establish His word which He spake, and I am risen up instead of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh spake, and build the house for the name of Yahweh, God of Israel,
\v 21 and set there a place for the ark, where is the covenant of Yahweh which He made with our fathers in His bringing them out from the land of Egypt.'
\v 22 And Solomon standeth before the altar of Yahweh, over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth his hands towards the heavens,
\v 23 and said, 'Yahweh, God of Israel, there is not a God like Thee, in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the kindness for Your servants, those walking before Thee with all their heart,
\v 24 who hast kept for Your servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him; yea, Thou speakest with Your mouth, and with Your hand hast fulfilled it, as at this day.
\v 25 And now, Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel — only, if your sons watch their way, to walk before Me as you hast walked before Me.
\v 26 'And now, O God of Israel, let it be established, I pray Thee, Your word which Thou hast spoken to Your servant, David my father.
\v 27 But, is it true? — God dwelleth on the earth! lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens do not contain Thee, how much less this house which I have builded!
\v 28 'Then you hast turned unto the prayer of Your servant, and unto his supplication, O Yahweh my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer which Your servant is praying before Thee to-day,
\v 29 for Thine eyes being open towards this house night and day, towards the place of which Thou hast said, My Name is there; to hearken unto the prayer which Your servant prayeth towards this place.
\v 30 Then Thou hast hearkened unto the supplication of Your servant, and of Your people Israel, which they pray towards this place; yea, Thou will hearken in the place of Your dwelling, in the heavens — and Thou hast hearkened, and hast forgiven,
\v 31 that which a man sinneth against his neighbour, and he had lifted up upon him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath had come in before Thine altar in this house,
\v 32 then Thou will hear in the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Your servants, to declare wicked the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\v 33 'In Your people Israel being smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back unto Thee, and have confessed Your name, and prayed, and made supplication unto Thee in this house,
\v 34 then you will hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Your people Israel, and brought them back unto the ground that Thou gavest to their fathers.
\v 35 'In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Your name, and from their sin turn back, for Thou will afflict them,
\v 36 then Thou will hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Your servants, and of Your people Israel, for Thou directest them the good way in which they go, and hast given rain on Your land which Thou hast given to Your people for inheritance.
\v 37 Famine — when it is in the land; pestilence — when it is; blasting, mildew, locust; caterpillar — when it is; when its enemy had distressed it in the land in its gates, any plague, any sickness, — 
\v 38 any prayer, any supplication that is of any man of all Your people Israel, who know each the plague of his own heart, and had spread his hands towards this house,
\v 39 then Thou will hear in the heavens, the settled place of Your dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast done, and hast given to each according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest, (for Thou hast known — Yourself alone — the heart of all the sons of man),
\v 40 so that they fear Thee all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers.
\v 41 And also, unto the stranger who is not of Your people Israel, and had come from a land afar off for Your name's sake — 
\v 42 (for they hear of Your great name, and of Your strong hand, and of Your stretched-out arm) — and he had come in and prayed towards this house,
\v 43 Thou will hear in the heavens, the settled place of Your dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger called unto Thee for, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, to fear Thee like Your people Israel, and to know that Your name had been called on this house which I have builded.
\v 44 'When Your people did go out to battle against its enemy, in the way that Thou will send them, and they have prayed unto Yahweh the way of the city which you hast fixed on, and of the house which I have builded for Your name;
\v 45 then Thou hast heard in the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause.
\v 46 'When they sin against Thee (for there is not a man who sinneth not), and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them up before an enemy, and they have taken captive their captivity unto the land of the enemy far off or near;
\v 47 and they have turned it back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee, in the land of their captors, saying, We have sinned and done perversely — we have done wickedly;
\v 48 yea, they have turned back unto Thee, with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and have prayed unto Thee the way of their land, which Thou gavest to their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have builded for Your name:
\v 49 'Then Thou hast heard in the heavens, the settled place of Your dwelling, their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause,
\v 50 and hast forgiven Your people who have sinned against Thee, even all their transgressions which they have transgressed against Thee, and hast given them mercies before their captors, and they have had mercy on them — 
\v 51 (for Your people and Your inheritance are they, whom Thou did bring out of Egypt, out of the middle of the furnace of iron) — 
\v 52 for Thine eyes being open unto the supplication of Your servant, and unto the supplication of Your people Israel, to hearken unto them in all they call unto Thee for;
\v 53 for Thou hast separated them to Yourself for an inheritance, out of all the peoples of the earth, as Thou did speak by the hand of Moses Your servant, in Your bringing out our fathers from Egypt, O Lord Yahweh.'
\v 54 And it came to pass, at Solomon's finishing to pray unto Yahweh all this prayer and supplication, he had risen from before the altar of Yahweh, from bending on his knees, and his hands spread out to the heavens,
\v 55 and he standeth and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\v 56 Blessed is Yahweh who had given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He had spoken; there had not fallen one word of all His good word, which He spake by the hand of Moses his servant.
\v 57 'Yahweh our God is with us as He had been with our fathers; He did not forsake us nor leave us;
\v 58 to incline our heart unto Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments, which He commanded our fathers;
\v 59 and these my words with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, are near unto Yahweh our God by day and by night, to maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, the matter of a day in its day;
\v 60 for all the peoples of the earth knowing that Yahweh, He is God; there is none else;
\v 61 and your heart had been perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commands, as at this day.'
\v 62 And the king and all Israel with him are sacrificing a sacrifice before Yahweh;
\v 63 and Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he had sacrificed to Yahweh, oxen, twenty and two yousand, and sheep, a hundred and twenty yousand; and the king and all the sons of Israel dedicate the house of Yahweh.
\v 64 On that day had the king sanctified the middle of the court that is before the house of Yahweh, for he had made there the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the peace-offerings; for the altar of brass that is before Yahweh is too little to contain the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
\v 65 And Solomon made, at that time, the festival — and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt — before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days; fourteen days.
\v 66 On the eighth day he had sent the people away, and they bless the king, and go to their tents, rejoicing and glad of heart for all the good that Yahweh had done to David His servant, and to Israel His people.
\c 9
\v 1 And it came to pass, at Solomon's finishing to build the house of Yahweh, and the house of the king, and all the desire of Solomon that he delighted to do,
\v 2 that Yahweh appeareth unto Solomon a second time, as He appeared unto him in Gibeon,
\v 3 and Yahweh said unto him, 'I have heard your prayer and your supplication with which you hast made supplication before Me; I have hallowed this house that you hast built to put My name there — unto the age, and Mine eyes and My heart have been there all the days.
\v 4 And you — if you will walk before Me as David your father walked, in simplicity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee — My statutes and My judgments you will keep — 
\v 5 then I have established the throne of your kingdom over Israel — to the age, as I spake unto David your father, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from being on the throne of Israel.
\v 6 If ye at all turn back — you and your sons — from after Me, and keep not My commands — My statutes, that I have set before you, and ye have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them,
\v 7 then I have cut off Israel from the face of the ground that I have given to them, and the house that I have hallowed for My name I send away from My presence, and Israel had been for a simile and for a byword among all the peoples;
\v 8 as to this house, that is high, every one passing by it is astonished, and had hissed, and they have said, Wherefore had Yahweh done thus to this land and to this house?
\v 9 and they have said, Because that they have forsaken Yahweh their God, who brought out their fathers from the land of Egypt, and they lay hold on other gods, and bow themselves to them, and serve them; therefore had Yahweh brought in upon them all this evil.'
\v 10 And it came to pass, at the end of twenty years, that Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh, and the house of the king.
\v 11 Hiram king of Tyre had assisted Solomon with cedar-trees, and with fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire; then did king Solomon give to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\v 12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given to him, and they have not been right in his eyes,
\v 13 and he said, 'What are these cities that you hast given to me, my brother?' and one called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
\v 14 And Hiram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
\v 15 And this is the matter of the tribute that king Solomon had lifted up, to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer,
\v 16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and did capture Gezer, and did burn it with fire, and the Canaanite who is dwelling in the city he had killed, and gave it with presents to his daughter, wife of Solomon.)
\v 17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-Horon the lower,
\v 18 and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land;
\v 19 and all the cities of stores that king Solomon had, and the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and the desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\v 20 The whole of the people that is left of the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are not of the sons of Israel — 
\v 21 their sons who are left behind them in the land, whom the sons of Israel have not been able to devote — he had even lifted up on them a tribute of service unto this day.
\v 22 And out of the sons of Israel Solomon had not appointed a servant, for they are the men of war, and his servants, and his heads, and his captains, and the heads of his chariots, and his horsemen.
\v 23 These are the heads of the officers who are over the work of Solomon, fifty and five hundred, those ruling among the people who are labouring in the work.
\v 24 Only, the daughter of Pharaoh went up out of the city of David unto her house that Solomon built for her; then he built Millo.
\v 25 And Solomon caused to ascend, three times in a year, burnt-offerings and peace-offerings on the altar that he built to Yahweh, and he perfumed it with that which is before Yahweh, and finished the house.
\v 26 And a navy had king Solomon made in Ezion-Geber, that is beside Eloth, on the edge of the Sea of Suph, in the land of Edom.
\v 27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen knowing the sea, with servants of Solomon,
\v 28 and they come in to Ophir and take there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and bring it in unto king Solomon.
\c 10
\v 1 And the queen of Sheba is hearing of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh, and came to try him with enigmas,
\v 2 and she came to Jerusalem, with a very great company, camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stone, and she came unto Solomon, and spoke unto him all that had been with her heart.
\v 3 And Solomon declareth to her all her matters — there had not been a thing hid from the king that he had not declared to her.
\v 4 And the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he built,
\v 5 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his butlers, and his burnt-offering that he caused to ascend in the house of Yahweh, and there had not been in her any more spirit.
\v 6 And she said unto the king, 'True had been the word that I heard in my land, concerning your matters and your wisdom;
\v 7 and I gave no credence to the words till that I have come, and my eyes see, and lo, it was not declared to me — the half; you hast added wisdom and goodness unto the report that I heard.
\v 8 O the happiness of your men, O the happiness of your servants — these — who are standing before thee continually, who are hearing your wisdom!
\v 9 Yahweh your God is blessed who delighted in thee, to put thee on the throne of Israel; in Yahweh's loving Israel to the age He did set thee for king, to do judgment and righteousness.
\v 10 And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices very many, and precious stone; there came not like that spice any more for abundance that the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\v 11 And also, the navy of Hiram that bore gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir almug-trees very many, and precious stone;
\v 12 and the king made the almug-trees a support for the house of Yahweh, and for the house of the king, and harps and psalteries for singers; there have not come such almug-trees, nor have there been seen such unto this day.
\v 13 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, apart from that which he gave to her as a memorial of king Solomon, and she turneth and went to her land, she and her servants.
\v 14 And the weight of the gold that had come to Solomon in one year is six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,
\v 15 apart from that of the tourists, and of the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the land.
\v 16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of alloyed gold — six hundred of gold go up on the one target;
\v 17 and three hundred shields of alloyed gold — three pounds of gold go up on the one shield; and the king putteth them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\v 18 And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with refined gold;
\v 19 six steps had the throne, and a round top is to the throne behind it, and hands are on this side and on that, unto the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near the hands,
\v 20 and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps, on this side and on that; it had not been made so for any kingdom.
\v 21 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon are of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon are of refined gold — there are none of silver; it was not reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything,
\v 22 for a navy of Tarshish had the king at sea with a navy of Hiram; once in three years came the navy of Tarshish, bearing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\v 23 And king Solomon is greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom,
\v 24 and all the earth is seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom that God had put into his heart,
\v 25 and they are bringing each his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, the matter of a year in a year.
\v 26 And Solomon gathereth chariots, and horsemen, and he had a yousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve yousand horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariot, and with the king in Jerusalem.
\v 27 And the king made the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he had made as the sycamores that are in the low country, for abundance.
\v 28 And the outgoing of the horses that king Solomon had is from Egypt, and from Keveh; merchants of the king take from Keveh at a price;
\v 29 and a chariot came up and came out of Egypt for six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred, and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram; by their hand they bring out.
\c 11
\v 1 And king Solomon had loved many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh, females of Moab, Ammon, Edom, Zidon, and of the Hittites,
\v 2 of the nations of which Yahweh said unto the sons of Israel, 'Ye do not go in to them, and they do not go in to you; surely they turn aside your heart after their gods;' to them had Solomon cleaved for love.
\v 3 And he had women, princesses, seven hundred, and concubines three hundred; and his wives turn aside his heart.
\v 4 And it came to pass, at the time of the old age of Solomon, his wives have turned aside his heart after other gods, and his heart had not been perfect with Yahweh his God, like the heart of David his father.
\v 5 And Solomon went after Ashtoreth goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites;
\v 6 and Solomon did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and had not been fully after Yahweh, like David his father.
\v 7 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is on the front of Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the sons of Ammon;
\v 8 and so he had done for all his strange women, who are perfuming and sacrificing to their gods.
\v 9 And Yahweh sheweth Himself angry with Solomon, for his heart had turned aside from Yahweh, God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,
\v 10 and given a charge unto him concerning this thing, not to go after other gods; and he had not kept that which Yahweh commanded,
\v 11 and Yahweh said to Solomon, 'Because that this had been with thee, and you hast not kept My covenant and My statutes that I charged upon thee, I surely rend the kingdom from thee, and have given it to your servant.
\v 12 'Only, in your days I do it not, for the sake of David your father; out of the hand of your son I rend it;
\v 13 only all the kingdom I do not rend away; one tribe I give to your son, for the sake of David My servant, and for the sake of Jerusalem, that I have chosen.'
\v 14 And Yahweh raiseth up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; of the seed of the king is he in Edom;
\v 15 and it came to pass, in David's being with Edom, in the going up of Joab head of the host to bury the killed, that he smiteth every male in Edom — 
\v 16 for six months did Joab abide there, and all Israel, till the cutting off of every male in Edom — 
\v 17 and Hadad fleeth, he and certain Edomites, of the servants of his father, with him, to go in to Egypt, and Hadad is a little youth,
\v 18 and they rise out of Midian, and come into Paran, and take men with them out of Paran, and come in to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he gave to him a house, and bread had commanded for him, and land had given to him.
\v 19 And Hadad findeth grace in the eyes of Pharaoh exceedingly, and he gave to him a wife, the sister of his own wife, sister of Tahpenes the mistress;
\v 20 and the sister of Tahpenes beareth to him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes weaneth him within the house of Pharaoh, and Genubath is in the house of Pharaoh in the middle of the sons of Pharaoh.
\v 21 And Hadad had heard in Egypt that David had lain with his fathers, and that Joab head of the host is dead, and Hadad said unto Pharaoh, 'Send me away, and I go unto my land.'
\v 22 And Pharaoh said to him, 'But, what art you lacking with me, that lo, you art seeking to go unto yours own land?' and he said, 'Nay, but you will certainly send me away.'
\v 23 And God raiseth to him an adversary, Rezon son of Eliadah, who had fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah, his lord,
\v 24 and gathereth unto himself men, and is head of a troop in David's slaying them, and they go to Damascus, and dwell in it, and reign in Damascus;
\v 25 and he is an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, (besides the evil that Hadad did), and he cutteth off in Israel, and reigneth over Aram.
\v 26 And Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda — the name of whose mother is Zeruah, a widow woman — servant to Solomon, he also lifteth up a hand against the king;
\v 27 and this is the thing for which he lifted up a hand against the king: Solomon built Millo — he shut up the breach of the city of David his father,
\v 28 and the man Jeroboam is mighty in valour, and Solomon saw the young man that he is doing business, and appointeth him over all the burden of the house of Joseph.
\v 29 And it came to pass, at that time, that Jeroboam had gone out from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite, the prophet, findeth him in the way, and he is covering himself with a new garment; and both of them are by themselves in a field,
\v 30 and Ahijah laid hold on the new garment that is on him, and rendeth it — twelve pieces,
\v 31 and said to Jeroboam, 'Take to thee ten pieces, for thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, lo, I am rending the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and have given to thee the ten tribes,
\v 32 and the one tribe he had for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have fixed on, out of all the tribes of Israel.
\v 33 Because they have forsaken Me, and bow themselves to Ashtoreth, goddess of the Zidonians, to Chemosh god of Moab, and to Milcom god of the sons of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and My statutes and My judgments, like David his father.
\v 34 'And I do not take the whole of the kingdom out of his hand, for prince I make him all days of his life, for the sake of David My servant whom I chose, who kept My commands and My statutes;
\v 35 and I have taken the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and given it to thee — the ten tribes;
\v 36 and to his son I give one tribe, for there being a lamp to David My servant all the days before Me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen to Myself to put My name there.
\v 37 'And thee I take, and you hast reigned over all that your soul desireth, and you hast been king over Israel;
\v 38 and it had been, if you will hear all that I command thee, and hast walked in My ways, and done that which is right in Mine eyes, to keep My statutes and My commands, as did David My servant, that I have been with thee, and have built for thee a stedfast house, as I built for David, and have given to thee Israel,
\v 39 and I humble the seed of David for this; only, not all the days.'
\v 40 And Solomon seeketh to put Jeroboam to death, and Jeroboam riseth and fleeth to Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and he is in Egypt till the death of Solomon.
\v 41 And the rest of the matters of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written on the book of the matters of Solomon?
\v 42 And the days that Solomon had reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel are forty years,
\v 43 and Solomon lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David his father, and reign did Rehoboam his son in his stead.
\c 12
\v 1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for to Shechem had all Israel come to make him king.
\v 2 And it came to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat's hearing (and he is yet in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam dwelleth in Egypt),
\v 3 that they send and call for him; and they come — Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel — and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,
\v 4 Your father made hard our yoke, and you, now, make light some of the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.'
\v 5 And he said unto them, 'Go — yet three days, and come back unto me;' and the people go.
\v 6 And king Rehoboam consulteth with the elders who have been standing in the presence of Solomon his father, in his being alive, saying, 'How are ye counselling to answer this people?'
\v 7 And they speak unto him, saying, 'If, to-day, you art servant to this people, and hast served them, and answered them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.'
\v 8 And he forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, who are standing before him;
\v 9 and he said unto them, 'What are ye counselling, and we answer this people, who have spoken unto me, saying, Lighten somewhat of the yoke that your father put upon us?'
\v 10 And they speak unto him — the lads who had grown up with him — saying, 'Thus will you say to this people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and you, make it light upon us; thus will you speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father;
\v 11 and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I — I chastise you with scorpions.'
\v 12 And they come — Jeroboam and all the people — unto Rehoboam, on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, 'Come back unto me on the third day.'
\v 13 And the king answereth the people sharply, and forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him,
\v 14 and spoke unto them, according to the counsel of the lads, saying, 'My father made your yoke heavy, and I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I — I chastise you with scorpions;'
\v 15 and the king hearkened not unto the people, for the revolution was from Yahweh, in order to establish His word that Yahweh spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat.
\v 16 And all Israel see that the king had not hearkened unto them, and the people send the king back word, saying, 'What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see your house, O David!' and Israel went to its tents.
\v 17 As to the sons of Israel, those dwelling in the cities of Judah — over them reign did Rehoboam.
\v 18 And king Rehoboam sent Adoram who is over the tribute, and all Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam had strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;
\v 19 and Israel transgresseth against the house of David unto this day.
\v 20 And it came to pass, at all Israel's hearing that Jeroboam had returned, that they send and call him unto the company, and cause him to reign over all Israel; none had been after the house of David save the tribe of Judah alone.
\v 21 And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, and assembleth all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty yousand chosen warriors, to fight with the house of Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
\v 22 And the word of God is unto Shemaiah a man of God, saying,
\v 23 'Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying,
\v 24 Thus said Yahweh, Ye do not go up nor fight with your brethren the sons of Israel; turn back each to his house, for from Me had this thing been;' and they hear the word of Yahweh, and turn back to go according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 25 And Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelleth in it, and went out there, and built Penuel;
\v 26 and Jeroboam said in his heart, 'Now did the kingdom turn back to the house of David — 
\v 27 if this people go up to make sacrifices in the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, then had the heart of this people turned back unto their lord, unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they have killed me, and turned back unto Rehoboam king of Judah.'
\v 28 And the king taketh counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, 'Enough to you of going up to Jerusalem; lo, your gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'
\v 29 And he setteth the one in Beth-El, and the other he had put in Dan,
\v 30 and this thing became a sin, and the people go before the one — unto Dan.
\v 31 And he made the house of high places, and made priests of the extremities of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi;
\v 32 and Jeroboam made a festival in the eighth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival that is in Judah, and he offereth on the altar — so did he in Beth-El — to sacrifice to the calves which he made, and he had appointed in Beth-El the priests of the high places that he made.
\v 33 And he offereth up on the altar that he made in Beth-El, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month that he devised of his own heart, and he made a festival to the sons of Israel, and offereth on the altar — to make perfume.
\c 13
\v 1 And lo, a man of God had come from Judah, by the word of Yahweh, unto Beth-El, and Jeroboam is standing by the altar — to make perfume;
\v 2 and he called against the altar, by the word of Yahweh, and said, 'Altar! altar! thus said Yahweh, Lo, a son is born to the house of David — Josiah his name — and he had sacrificed on thee the priests of the high places who are making perfume on thee, and bones of man are burnt on thee.'
\v 3 And he had given on that day a sign, saying, 'This is the sign that Yahweh had spoken, Lo, the altar is rent, and the ashes poured forth that are on it.'
\v 4 And it came to pass, at the king's hearing the word of the man of God that he called against the altar in Beth-El, that Jeroboam putteth forth his hand from off the altar, saying, 'Catch him;' and his hand is dried up that he had put forth against him, and he is not able to bring it back unto him,
\v 5 and the altar is rent, and the ashes poured forth from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of Yahweh.
\v 6 And the king answereth and said unto the man of God, 'Appease, I pray thee, the face of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, and my hand did come back unto me;' and the man of God appeaseth the face of Yahweh, and the hand of the king came back unto him, and it is as at the beginning.
\v 7 And the king spoke unto the man of God, 'Come in with me to the house, and refresh yourself, and I give to thee a gift.'
\v 8 And the man of God said unto the king, 'If you will give to me the half of yours house, I do not go in with thee, nor do I eat bread, nor do I drink water, in this place;
\v 9 for so He commanded me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Thou will not eat bread nor drink water, nor turn back in the way that you hast come.'
\v 10 And he went on in another way, and had not turned back in the way in which he came in unto Beth-El.
\v 11 And a certain aged prophet is dwelling in Beth-El, and his son came and recounteth to him all the deed that the man of God had done to-day in Beth-El, the words that he had spoken unto the king, — yea, they recount them to their father.
\v 12 And their father said unto them, 'Where is this — the way he had gone?' and his sons see the way that the man of God had gone who came from Judah.
\v 13 And he said unto his sons, 'Saddle for me the ass,' and they saddle for him the ass, and he rideth on it,
\v 14 and went after the man of God, and findeth him sitting under the oak, and said unto him, 'Art you the man of God who hast come from Judah?' and he said, 'I am.'
\v 15 And he said unto him, 'Come with me to the house, and eat bread.'
\v 16 And he said, 'I am not able to turn back with thee, and to go in with thee, nor do I eat bread or drink with thee water in this place,
\v 17 for a word is unto me by the word of Yahweh, Thou will not eat bread nor drink there water, you will not turn back to go in the way in which you camest.'
\v 18 And he said to him, 'I also am a prophet like thee, and a messenger spake unto me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Bring him back with thee unto your house, and he did eat bread and drink water;' — he had lied to him.
\v 19 And he turneth back with him, and eateth bread in his house, and drinketh water.
\v 20 And it came to pass — they are sitting at the table — and a word of Yahweh is unto the prophet who brought him back,
\v 21 and he called unto the man of God who came from Judah, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh, Because that you hast provoked the mouth of Yahweh, and hast not kept the command that Yahweh your God charged thee,
\v 22 and turnest back and will eat bread and drink water in the place of which He said unto thee, Thou will not eat bread nor drink water — your carcase came not in unto the burying-place of your fathers.'
\v 23 And it came to pass, after his eating bread, and after his drinking, that he saddleth for him the ass, for the prophet whom he had brought back,
\v 24 and he went, and a lion findeth him in the way, and putteth him to death, and his carcase is cast in the way, and the ass is standing near it, and the lion is standing near the carcase.
\v 25 And lo, men are passing by, and see the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing near the carcase, and they come and speak of it in the city in which the old prophet is dwelling.
\v 26 And the prophet who brought him back out of the way heareth and said, 'It is the man of God who provoked the mouth of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave him to the lion, and it destroyeth him, and putteth him to death, according to the word of Yahweh that he spake to him.'
\v 27 And he spoke unto his sons saying, 'Saddle for me the ass,' and they saddle it.
\v 28 And he went and findeth his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion are standing near the carcase — the lion had not eaten the carcase nor destroyed the ass.
\v 29 And the prophet taketh up the carcase of the man of God, and placeth it on the ass, and brought it back, and the old prophet came in unto the city to mourn and to bury him,
\v 30 and he placeth his carcase in his own grave, and they mourn for him, 'Oh, my brother!'
\v 31 And it came to pass, after his burying him, that he spoke unto his sons, saying, 'At my death — ye have buried me in the burying-place in which the man of God is buried; near his bones place my bones;
\v 32 for the word certainly came to pass that he called by the word of Yahweh concerning the altar which is Beth-El, and concerning all the houses of the high places that are in cities of Samaria.'
\v 33 After this thing Jeroboam had not turned from his evil way, and turneth back, and made of the extremities of the people priests of high places; he who is desirous he consecrateth his hand, and he is of the priests of the high places.
\v 34 And in this thing is the sin of the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the ground.
\c 14
\v 1 At that time was Abijah son of Jeroboam sick,
\v 2 and Jeroboam said to his wife, 'Rise, I pray thee, and change yourself, and they know not that you art wife of Jeroboam, and you hast gone to Shiloh; lo, there is Ahijah the prophet; he spake unto me of being king over this people;
\v 3 and you hast taken in your hand ten loaves, and crumbs, and a bottle of honey, and hast gone in unto him; he did declare to thee what became of the youth.'
\v 4 And the wife of Jeroboam did so, and riseth, and went to Shiloh, and entereth the house of Ahijah, and Ahijah is not able to see, for his eyes have stood because of his age.
\v 5 And Yahweh said unto Ahijah, 'Lo, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek a word from thee concerning her son, for he is sick; thus and thus you will speak unto her, and it came to pass at her coming in, that she is making herself strange.'
\v 6 And it came to pass, at Ahijah's hearing the sound of her feet as she came in to the opening, that he said, 'Come in, wife of Jeroboam, why is this — you art making yourself strange? and I am sent unto thee with a sharp thing:
\v 7 Go, say to Jeroboam, Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Because that I have made thee high out of the middle of the people, and appoint thee leader over my people Israel,
\v 8 and rend the kingdom from the house of David, and give it to thee, — and you hast not been as My servant David who kept My commands, and who walked after Me with all his heart, to do only that which is right in Mine eyes,
\v 9 and you will evil above all who have been before thee, and goest, and makest to thee other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and Me you hast cast behind your back:
\v 10 Therefore, lo, I am bringing in evil unto the house of Jeroboam, and have cut off to Jeroboam those sitting on the wall — shut up and left — in Israel, and have put away the posterity of the house of Jeroboam, as one putteth away the dung till its consumption;
\v 11 him who dieth of Jeroboam in a city do the dogs eat, and him who dieth in a field do fowl of the heavens eat, for Yahweh had spoken.
\v 12 And you, rise, go to your house; in the going in of your feet to the city — had the lad died;
\v 13 and all Israel have mourned for him, and buried him, for this one — by himself — came of Jeroboam unto a grave, because there had been found in him a good thing towards Yahweh, God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
\v 14 And Yahweh had raised up for Him a king over Israel who cutteth off the house of Jeroboam this day — and what? — even now!
\v 15 And Yahweh had smitten Israel as the reed is moved by the waters, and had plucked Israel from off this good ground that He gave to their fathers, and scattered them beyond the River, because that they made their shrines, provoking Yahweh to anger;
\v 16 and He gave up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned, and that he caused Israel to sin.'
\v 17 And the wife of Jeroboam riseth, and went, and came to Tirzah; she had come in to the threshold of the house, and the youth dieth;
\v 18 and they bury him, and mourn for him do all Israel, according to the word of Yahweh, that he spake by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet.
\v 19 And the rest of the matters of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, lo, they are written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\v 20 And the days that Jeroboam reigned are twenty and two years, and he lieth with his fathers, and reign did Nadab his son in his stead.
\v 21 And Rehoboam son of Solomon had reigned in Judah; a son of forty and one years is Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he had reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Yahweh chose to set His name there, out of all the tribes of Israel, and the name of his mother is Naamah the Ammonitess.
\v 22 And Judah did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and they make Him zealous above all that their fathers did by their sins that they have sinned.
\v 23 And they build — also they — for themselves high places, and standing-pillars, and shrines, on every high height, and under every green tree;
\v 24 and also a whoremonger had been in the land; they have done according to all the abominations of the nations that Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel.
\v 25 And it came to pass, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, gone up had Shishak king of Egypt against Jerusalem,
\v 26 and he taketh the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the house of the king, yea, the whole he had taken; and he taketh all the shields of gold that Solomon made.
\v 27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and had made them a charge on the hand of the heads of the runners, those keeping the opening of the house of the king,
\v 28 and it came to pass, from the going in of the king to the house of Yahweh, the runners bear them, and have brought them back unto the chamber of the runners.
\v 29 And the rest of the matters of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 30 And war had been between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days;
\v 31 and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers, in the city of David, and the name of his mother is Naamah the Ammonitess, and reign did Abijam his son in his stead.
\c 15
\v 1 And in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam son of Nebat, reigned had Abijam over Judah;
\v 2 three years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Maachah daughter of Abishalom;
\v 3 and he walketh in all the sins of his father, that he did before him, and his heart had not been perfect with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father;
\v 4 but for David's sake had Yahweh his God given to him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem,
\v 5 in that David did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, and turned not aside from all that He commanded him all days of his life — only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite;
\v 6 and war had been between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
\v 7 And the rest of the matters of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? And war had been between Abijam and Jeroboam;
\v 8 and Abijam lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign did Asa his son in his stead.
\v 9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned had Asa over Judah,
\v 10 and forty and one years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Maachah daughter of Abishalom.
\v 11 And Asa did that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his father,
\v 12 and removeth the whoremongers out of the land, and turneth aside all the idols that his fathers made;
\v 13 and also Maachah his mother — he turneth her aside from being mistress, in that she made a horrible thing for a shrine, and Asa cutteth down her horrible thing, and burneth it by the brook Kidron;
\v 14 and the high places have not turned aside; only, the heart of Asa had been perfect with Yahweh all his days,
\v 15 and he brought in the sanctified things of his father, and his own sanctified things, to the house of Yahweh, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\v 16 And war had been between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days,
\v 17 and Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, not to permit any one going out and coming in to Asa king of Judah.
\v 18 And Asa taketh all the silver and the gold that are left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the house of the king, and gave them into the hand of his servants, and king Asa sent them unto Ben-Hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Hezion king of Aram, who is dwelling in Damascus, saying,
\v 19 A covenant is between me and thee, between my father and your father; lo, I have sent to thee a reward of silver and gold; go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he went up from off me.'
\v 20 And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa, and sent the heads of the forces that he had against cities of Israel, and smiteth Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Beth-Maachah, and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali;
\v 21 and it came to pass at Baasha's hearing, that he ceaseth from building Ramah, and dwelleth in Tirzah.
\v 22 And king Asa had summoned all Judah — there is none exempt — and they lift up the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha had built, and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\v 23 And the rest of all the matters of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah? Only, at the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet;
\v 24 and Asa lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 25 And Nadab son of Jeroboam had reigned over Israel, in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigneth over Israel two years,
\v 26 and did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and went in the way of his father, and in his sin that he made Israel to sin.
\v 27 And conspire against him did Baasha son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, and Baasha smiteth him in Gibbethon, which is to the Philistines — and Nadab and all Israel are laying siege against Gibbethon — 
\v 28 yea, Baasha putteth him to death in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigneth in his stead.
\v 29 And it came to pass, at his reigning, he had smitten the whole house of Jeroboam, he had not left any breathing to Jeroboam till his destroying him, according to the word of Yahweh, that He spake by the hand of His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
\v 30 because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned, and that he caused Israel to sin, by his provocation with which he provoked to anger Yahweh, God of Israel.
\v 31 And the rest of the matters of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 32 And war had been between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\v 33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah reigned had Baasha son of Ahijah over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years,
\v 34 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and walketh in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he caused Israel to sin.
\c 16
\v 1 And a word of Yahweh is unto Jehu son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying,
\v 2 Because that I have raised thee up out of the dust, and appoint thee leader over My people Israel, and you walkest in the way of Jeroboam, and causest My people Israel to sin — to provoke Me to anger with their sins;
\v 3 lo, I am putting away the posterity of Baasha, even the posterity of his house, and have given up your house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat;
\v 4 him who dieth of Baasha in a city do the dogs eat, and him who dieth of his in a field do fowl of the heavens eat.'
\v 5 And the rest of the matters of Baasha, and that which he did, and his might, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 6 And Baasha lieth with his fathers, and is buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 7 And also by the hand of Jehu son of Hanani the prophet a word of Yahweh had been concerning Baasha, and concerning his house, and concerning all the evil that he did in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke Him to anger with the work of his hands, to be like the house of Jeroboam, and concerning that for which he smote him.
\v 8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah reigned had Elah son of Baasha over Israel in Tirzah, two years;
\v 9 and conspire against him did his servant Zimri (head of the half of the chariots) and he is in Tirzah drinking — a drunkard in the house of Arza, who is over the house in Tirzah.
\v 10 And Zimri came in and smiteth him, and putteth him to death, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigneth in his stead;
\v 11 and it came to pass in his reigning, at his sitting on his throne, he had smitten the whole house of Baasha; he had not left to him any sitting on the wall, and of his redeemers, and of his friends.
\v 12 And Zimri destroyeth the whole house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, that He spake concerning Baasha, by the hand of Jehu the prophet:
\v 13 concerning all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, that they sinned, and that they caused Israel to sin to provoke Yahweh, God of Israel, with their vanities.
\v 14 And the rest of the matters of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, reigned had Zimri seven days in Tirzah; and the people are encamping against Gibbethon, which is to the Philistines;
\v 16 and the people who are encamping hear, saying, 'Zimri had conspired, and also had smitten the king;' and all Israel cause Omri head of the host to reign over Israel on that day in the camp.
\v 17 And Omri went up, and all Israel with him, from Gibbethon, and they lay siege to Tirzah.
\v 18 And it came to pass, at Zimri's seeing that the city had been captured, that he came in unto a high place of the house of the king, and burneth over him the house of the king with fire, and dieth,
\v 19 for his sins that he sinned, to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, to walk in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he did, to cause Israel to sin;
\v 20 and the rest of the matters of Zimri, and his conspiracy that he made, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 21 Then are the sons of Israel parted into halves; half of the people had been after Tibni son of Ginath to cause him to reign, and the half after Omri;
\v 22 and stronger are the people that are after Omri than the people that are after Tibni son of Ginath, and Tibni dieth, and Omri reigneth.
\v 23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah reigned had Omri over Israel twelve years; in Tirzah he had reigned six years,
\v 24 and he buyeth the mount Samaria from Shemer, with two talents of silver, and built on the mount, and called the name of the city that he had built by the name of Shemer, lord of the hill — Samaria.
\v 25 And Omri did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and did evil above all who are before him,
\v 26 and walketh in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and in his sin that he caused Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, God of Israel, with their vanities.
\v 27 And the rest of the matters of Omri that he did, and his might that he got, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 28 And Omri lieth with his fathers, and is buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 29 And Ahab son of Omri had reigned over Israel in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab son of Omri reigneth over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years,
\v 30 and Ahab son of Omri did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh above all who are before him.
\v 31 And it came to pass — had it been light his walking in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat? — then he taketh a wife, Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians, and went and serveth Baal, and boweth himself to it,
\v 32 and raiseth up an altar for Baal, in the house of the Baal, that he built in Samaria;
\v 33 and Ahab made the shrine, and Ahab addeth to do so as to provoke Yahweh, God of Israel, above all the kings of Israel who have been before him.
\v 34 In his days had Hiel the Beth-Elite built Jericho; in Abiram his first-born he laid its foundation, and in Segub his youngest he set up its doors, according to the word of Yahweh that He spake by the hand of Joshua son of Nun.
\c 17
\v 1 And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, 'Yahweh, God of Israel, lived, before whom I have stood, there is not these years dew and rain, except according to my word.'
\v 2 And the word of Yahweh is unto him, saying,
\v 3 Go from this place; and you hast turned for thee eastward, and been hidden by the brook Cherith, that is on the front of the Jordan,
\v 4 and it had been, from the brook you will drink, and the ravens I have commanded to sustain thee there.'
\v 5 And he went and did according to the word of Yahweh, yea, he went and dwelleth by the brook Cherith, that is on the front of the Jordan,
\v 6 and the ravens are bringing to him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, and of the brook he drinketh.
\v 7 And it came to pass, at the end of days, that the brook drieth up, for there had been no rain in the land,
\v 8 and the word of Yahweh is unto him, saying,
\v 9 Rise, go to Zarephad, that is to Zidon, and you hast dwelt there; lo, I have commanded there a widow woman to sustain thee.'
\v 10 And he riseth, and went to Zarephad, and came in unto the opening of the city, and lo there, a widow woman gathering sticks, and he called unto her, and said, 'Bring, I pray thee, to me, a little water in a vessel, and I drink.'
\v 11 And she went to bring it, and he called unto her and said, 'Bring, I pray thee, to me a morsel of bread in your hand.'
\v 12 And she said, 'Yahweh your God lived, I have not a cake, but the fulness of the hand of meal in a pitcher, and a little oil in a dish; and lo, I am gathering two sticks, and have gone in and prepared it for myself, and for my son, and we have eaten it — and died.'
\v 13 And Elijah said unto her, 'Fear not, go, do according to your word, only make for me there a little cake, in the first place, and you hast brought out to me; and for thee and for your son make — last;
\v 14 for thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, The pitcher of meal is not consumed, and the dish of oil is not lacking, till the day of Yahweh's giving a shower on the face of the ground.'
\v 15 And she went, and did according to the word of Elijah, and she eateth, she and he, and her household — days;
\v 16 the pitcher of meal was not consumed, and the dish of oil did not lack, according to the word of Yahweh that He spake by the hand of Elijah.
\v 17 And it came to pass, after these things, the son of the woman, mistress of the house, had been sick, and his sickness is very severe till that no breath had been left in him.
\v 18 And she said unto Elijah, 'What — to me and to thee, O man of God? you hast come unto me to cause mine iniquity to be remembered, and to put my son to death!'
\v 19 And he said unto her, 'Give to me your son;' and he taketh him out of her bosom, and taketh him up unto the upper chamber where he is abiding, and laid him on his own bed,
\v 20 and crieth unto Yahweh, and said, 'Yahweh my God, also on the widow with whom I am sojourning hast Thou done evil — to put her son to death?'
\v 21 And he stretcheth himself out on the lad three times, and called unto Yahweh, and said, 'O Yahweh my God, let turn back, I pray Thee, the soul of this lad into his middle;'
\v 22 and Yahweh hearkeneth to the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the lad turneth back into his middle, and he lived.
\v 23 And Elijah taketh the lad, and brought him down from the upper chamber of the house, and gave him to his mother, and Elijah said, 'See, your son lived!'
\v 24 And the woman said unto Elijah, 'Now, this I have known, that a man of God you art, and the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.'
\c 18
\v 1 And the days are many, and the word of Yahweh had been unto Elijah in the third year, saying, 'Go, appear unto Ahab, and I give rain on the face of the ground;'
\v 2 and Elijah went to appear unto Ahab. And the famine is severe in Samaria,
\v 3 and Ahab called unto Obadiah, who is over the house — and Obadiah had been fearing Yahweh greatly,
\v 4 and it came to pass, in Jezebel's cutting off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah taketh a hundred prophets, and hideth them, fifty men in a cave, and had sustained them with bread and water — 
\v 5 and Ahab said unto Obadiah, 'Go through the land, unto all fountains of waters, and unto all the brooks, if so be we find hay, and keep alive horse and mule, and do not cut off any of the cattle.'
\v 6 And they apportion to themselves the land, to pass over into it; Ahab had gone in one way by himself, and Obadiah had gone in another way by himself;
\v 7 and Obadiah is in the way, and lo, Elijah — to meet him; and he discerneth him, and falleth on his face, and said, 'Art you he — my lord Elijah?'
\v 8 And he said to him, 'I am; go, say to your lord, Lo, Elijah.'
\v 9 And he said, 'What have I sinned, that you art giving your servant into the hand of Ahab — to put me to death?
\v 10 Yahweh your God lived, if there is a nation and kingdom whither my lord had not sent to seek thee; and they said, He is not, then he caused the kingdom and the nation to swear, that it did not find thee;
\v 11 and now, you art saying, Go, say to your lord, Lo, Elijah;
\v 12 and it had been, I go from thee, and the Spirit of Yahweh did lift thee up, whither I know not, and I have come to declare to Ahab, and he did not find thee, and he had killed me; and your servant is fearing Yahweh from my youth.
\v 13 'Hath it not been declared to my lord that which I have done in Jezebel's slaying the prophets of Yahweh, that I hide of the prophets of Yahweh a hundred men, fifty by fifty in a cave, and sustained them with bread and water?
\v 14 and now you art saying, Go, say to my lord, Lo, Elijah — and he had killed me!'
\v 15 And Elijah said, 'Yahweh of Hosts lived, before whom I have stood, surely to-day I appear unto him.'
\v 16 And Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and declareth it to him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah,
\v 17 and it came to pass at Ahab's seeing Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, 'Art you he — the troubler of Israel?'
\v 18 And he said, 'I have not troubled Israel, but you and the house of your father, in your forsaking the commands of Yahweh, and you goest after the Baalim;
\v 19 and now, send, gather unto me all Israel, unto the mount of Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the shrine, four hundred — eating at the table of Jezebel.'
\v 20 And Ahab sent among all the sons of Israel, and gathereth the prophets unto the mount of Carmel;
\v 21 and Elijah came nigh unto all the people, and said, 'Till when are ye leaping on the two branches? — if Yahweh is God, go after Him; and if Baal, go after him;' and the people have not answered him a word.
\v 22 And Elijah said unto the people, 'I — I have been left a prophet of Yahweh — by myself; and the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men;
\v 23 and let them give to us two bullocks, and they choose for themselves the one bullock, and cut it in pieces, and place it on the wood, and place no fire; and I — I prepare the other bullock, and have put it on the wood, and fire I do not place; — 
\v 24 and ye have called in the name of your god, and I — I call in the name of Yahweh, and it had been, the god who answereth by fire — He is the God.' And all the people answer and say, 'Good is the word.'
\v 25 And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, 'Choose for you the one bullock, and prepare first, for ye are the multitude, and call ye in the name of your god, and place no fire.'
\v 26 And they take the bullock that one gave to them, and prepare, and call in the name of Baal from the morning even till the noon, saying, 'O Baal, answer us!' and there is no voice, and there is none answering; and they leap on the altar that one had made.
\v 27 And it came to pass, at noon, that Elijah plaid on them, and said, 'Call with a loud voice, for he is a god, for he is meditating, or pursuing, or on a journey; it may be he is asleep, an did awake.'
\v 28 And they call with a loud voice, and cut themselves, according to their ordinance, with swords and with spears, till a flowing of blood is on them;
\v 29 and it came to pass, at the passing by of the noon, that they feign themselves prophets till the going up of the present, and there is no voice, and there is none answering, and there is none attending.
\v 30 And Elijah said to all the people, 'Come nigh unto me;' and all the people come nigh unto him, and he repaireth the altar of Yahweh that is broken down;
\v 31 and Elijah taketh twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Yahweh was, saying, 'Israel is your name;'
\v 32 and he built with the stones an altar, in the name of Yahweh, and made a trench, as about the space of two measures of seed, round about the altar.
\v 33 And he arrangeth the wood, and cutteth in pieces the bullock, and placeth it on the wood, and said, 'Fill ye four pitchers of water, and pour on the burnt-offering, and on the wood;
\v 34 and he said, 'Do it a second time;' and they do it a second time; and he said, 'Do it a third time;' and they do it a third time;
\v 35 and the water went round about the altar, and also, the trench he had filled with water.
\v 36 And it came to pass, at the going up of the evening -present, that Elijah the prophet came nigh and said, 'Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to-day let it be known that Thou art God in Israel, and I Your servant, that by Your word I have done the whole of these things;
\v 37 answer me, O Yahweh, answer me, and this people did know that Thou art Yahweh God; and Thou hast turned their heart backward.'
\v 38 And there falleth a fire of Yahweh, and consumeth the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and the water that is in the trench it had licked up.
\v 39 And all the people see, and fall on their faces, and say, 'Yahweh, He is the God, Yahweh, He is the God.'
\v 40 And Elijah said to them, 'Catch ye the prophets of Baal; let not a man escape of them;' and they catch them, and Elijah brought them down unto the stream Kishon, and did slaughter them there.
\v 41 And Elijah said to Ahab, 'Go up, eat and drink, because of the sound of the noise of the shower.'
\v 42 And Ahab went up to eat, and to drink, and Elijah had gone up unto the top of Carmel, and he stretcheth himself out on the earth, and he placeth his face between his knees,
\v 43 and said unto his young man, 'Go up, I pray thee, look attentively the way of the sea;' and he went up and looketh attentively, and said, 'There is nothing;' and he said, 'Turn back,' seven times.
\v 44 And it came to pass, at the seventh, that he said, 'Lo, a little thickness as the palm of a man is coming up out of the sea.' And he said, 'Go up, say unto Ahab, 'Bind — and go down, and the shower did not restrain thee.'
\v 45 And it came to pass, in the meantime, that the heavens have become black — thick clouds and wind — and the shower is great; and Ahab rideth, and went to Jezreel,
\v 46 and the hand of Yahweh had been on Elijah, and he girdeth up his loins, and runneth before Ahab, till yours entering Jezreel.
\c 19
\v 1 And Ahab declareth to Jezebel all that Elijah did, and all how he slew all the prophets by the sword,
\v 2 and Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, 'Thus did the gods, and thus do they add, surely about this time to-morrow, I make your life as the life of one of them.'
\v 3 And he feareth, and riseth, and went for his life, and came in to Beer-Sheba, that is Judah's, and leaveth his young man there,
\v 4 and he himself had gone into the wilderness a day's Journey, and came and sitteth under a certain retem-tree, and desireth his soul to die, and said, 'Enough, now, O Yahweh, take my soul, for I am not better than my fathers.'
\v 5 And he lieth down and sleepeth under a certain retem-tree, and lo, a messenger came against him, and said to him, 'Rise, eat;'
\v 6 and he looketh attentively, and lo, at his bolster a cake baken on burning stones, and a dish of water, and he eateth, and drinketh, and turneth, and lieth down.
\v 7 And the messenger of Yahweh turneth back a second time, and came against him, and said, 'Rise, eat, for the way is too great for thee;'
\v 8 and he riseth, and eateth, and drinketh, and went in the power of that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of God — Horeb.
\v 9 And he came in there, unto the cave, and lodgeth there, and lo, the word of Yahweh is unto him, and said to him, 'What — to thee, here, Elijah?'
\v 10 And he said, 'I have been very zealous for Yahweh, God of Hosts, for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant — Thine altars they have thrown down, and Your prophets they have killed by the sword, and I am left, I, by myself, and they seek my life — to take it.'
\v 11 And He said, 'Go out, and you hast stood in the mount before Yahweh.' And lo, Yahweh is passing by, and a wind — great and strong — is rending mountains, and shivering rocks before Yahweh: — not in the wind is Yahweh; and after the wind a shaking: — not in the shaking is Yahweh;
\v 12 and after the shaking a fire: — not in the fire is Yahweh; and after the fire a voice still small;
\v 13 and it came to pass, at Elijah's hearing it, that he wrappeth his face in his robe, and went out, and standeth at the opening of the cave, and lo, unto him is a voice, and it said, 'What — to thee, here, Elijah?'
\v 14 And he said, 'I have been very zealous for Yahweh, God of Hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, Thine altars they have thrown down, and Your prophets they have killed by the sword, and I am left, I, by myself, and they seek my life — to take it.'
\v 15 And Yahweh said unto him, 'Go turn back on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and you hast gone in, and anointed Hazael for king over Aram,
\v 16 and Jehu son of Nimshi you will anoint for king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat, of Abel-Meholah, you will anoint for prophet in your stead.
\v 17 'And it had been, him who is escaped from the sword of Hazael, put to death did Jehu, and him who is escaped from the sword of Jehu put to death did Elisha;
\v 18 and I have left in Israel seven yousand, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that had not kissed him.'
\v 19 And he went there, and findeth Elisha son of Shaphat, and he is plowing; twelve yoke are before him, and he is with the twelfth; and Elijah passeth over unto him, and threw his robe upon him,
\v 20 and he forsaketh the oxen, and runneth after Elijah, and said, 'Let me give a kiss, I pray thee, to my father and to my mother, and I go after thee.' And he said to him, 'Go, turn back, for what have I done to thee?'
\v 21 And he turneth back from after him, and taketh the yoke of oxen, and sacrificeth it, and with instruments of the oxen he had boiled their flesh, and gave to the people, and they eat, and he riseth, and went after Elijah, and serveth him.
\c 20
\v 1 And Ben-Hadad king of Aram had gathered all his force, and thirty and two kings are with him, and horse and chariot, and he went up and laid siege against Samaria, and fighteth with it,
\v 2 and sent messengers unto Ahab king of Israel, to the city,
\v 3 and said to him, 'Thus said Ben-Hadad, 'Your silver and your gold are mine, and your wives and your sons — the best — are mine.'
\v 4 And the king of Israel answereth and said, 'According to your word, my lord, O king: I am yours, and all that I have.'
\v 5 And the messengers turn back and say, 'Thus spake Ben-Hadad, saying, Surely I sent unto thee, saying, Your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your sons, to me you will give;
\v 6 for if, at this time to-morrow, I send my servants unto thee then they have searched your house, and the houses of your servants, and it had been, every desirable thing of yours eyes they place in their hand, and have taken away.'
\v 7 And the king of Israel called to all the elders of the land, and said, 'Know, I pray you, and see that evil this one is seeking, for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I withheld not from him.'
\v 8 And all the elders and all the people say unto him, 'Do not hearken, nor consent.'
\v 9 And he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, 'Say to my lord the king, All that you did send for unto your servant at the first I do, and this thing I am not able to do;' and the messengers go and take him back word.
\v 10 And Ben-Hadad sent unto him, and said, 'Thus do the gods to me, and thus do they add, if the dust of Samaria suffice for handfuls for all the people who are at my feet.'
\v 11 And the king of Israel answereth and said, 'Speak ye: let not him who is girding on boast himself as him who is loosing his armour.'
\v 12 And it came to pass at the hearing of this word — and he is drinking, he and the kings, in the booths — that he said unto his servants, 'Set yourselves;' and they set themselves against the city.
\v 13 And lo, a certain prophet had come nigh unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, 'Thus said Yahweh, 'Hast you seen all this great multitude? lo, I am giving it into your hand to-day, and you hast known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 14 And Ahab said, 'By whom?' and he said, 'Thus said Yahweh, By the young men of the heads of the provinces;' and he said, 'Who did direct the battle?' and he said, 'Thou.'
\v 15 And he inspecteth the young men of the heads of the provinces, and they are two hundred, two and thirty, and after them he had inspecteth the whole of the people, all the sons of Israel, seven yousand,
\v 16 and they go out at noon, and Ben-Hadad is drinking — drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings, helping him.
\v 17 And the young men of the heads of the provinces go out at the first, and Ben-Hadad sent, and they declare to him, saying, 'Men have come out of Samaria.'
\v 18 And he said, 'If for peace they have come out — catch them alive; and if for battle they have come out — alive catch them.'
\v 19 And these have gone out of the city — the young men of the heads of the provinces — and the force that is after them,
\v 20 and smite each his man, and Aram fleeth, and Israel pursueth them, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram escapeth on a horse, and the horsemen;
\v 21 and the king of Israel went out, and smiteth the horses, and the charioteers, and had smitten among the Aramaeans a great smiting.
\v 22 And the prophet came nigh unto the king of Israel, and said to him, 'Go, strengthen yourself, and know and see that which you will, for at the turn of the year the king of Aram is coming up against thee.'
\v 23 And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him, 'Gods of hills are their gods, therefore they were stronger than we; and yet, we fight with them in the plain — are we not stronger than they?
\v 24 'And this thing do you: turn aside the kings each out of his place, and set captains in their stead;
\v 25 and you, number to thee a force as the force that is fallen from thee, and horse for horse, and chariot for chariot, and we fight with them in the plain; are we not stronger than they?' and he hearkeneth to their voice, and did so.
\v 26 And it came to pass at the turn of the year, that Ben-Hadad inspecteth the Aramaeans, and went up to Aphek, to battle with Israel,
\v 27 and the sons of Israel have been inspected, and supported, and go to meet them, and the sons of Israel encamp before them, like two flocks of goats, and the Aramaeans have filled the land.
\v 28 And there came nigh a man of God, and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said, 'Thus said Yahweh, Because that the Aramaeans have said, God of hills is Yahweh, and He is not God of valleys — I have given the whole of this great multitude into your hand, and ye have known that I am Yahweh.'
\v 29 And they encamp one over-against another seven days, and it came to pass on the seventh day, that the battle draweth near, and the sons of Israel smite Aram — a hundred yousand footmen in one day.
\v 30 And those left flee to Aphek, unto the city, and the wall falleth on twenty and seven chief men who are left, and Ben-Hadad had fled, and came in unto the city, into the innermost part.
\v 31 And his servants say unto him, 'Lo, we pray thee, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel — that they are kind kings; let us put, we pray thee, sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and we go out unto the king of Israel; it may be he did keep thee alive.'
\v 32 And they gird sackcloth on their loins, and ropes are on their heads, and they come in unto the king of Israel, and say, 'Your servant Ben-Hadad had said, Let me live, I pray thee;' and he said, 'Is he yet alive? he is my brother.'
\v 33 And the men observe diligently, and hasten, and catch it from him, and say, 'Your brother Ben-Hadad;' and he said, 'Go ye in, bring him;' and Ben-Hadad came out unto him, and he caused him to come up on the chariot.
\v 34 And he said unto him, 'The cities that my father took from your father, I give back, and streets you will make for thee in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria;' — 'and I, with a covenant, send thee away;' and he made with him a covenant, and sent him away.
\v 35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour by the word of Yahweh, 'Smite me, I pray thee;' and the man refuseth to smite him,
\v 36 and he said to him, 'Because that you hast not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, lo, you art going from me, and the lion had smitten thee;' and he went from him, and the lion findeth him, and smiteth him.
\v 37 And he findeth another man, and said, 'Smite me, I pray thee;' and the man smiteth him, smiting and wounding,
\v 38 and the prophet went and standeth for the king on the way, and disguiseth himself with ashes on his eyes.
\v 39 And it came to pass — the king is passing by — that he had cried unto the king, and said, 'Your servant went out into the middle of the battle, and lo, a man had turned aside and brought in unto me a man, and said, Keep this man; if he be at all missing, then had your life been for his life, or a talent of silver you will weigh out;
\v 40 and it came to pass, your servant is working hither and thither, and he is not!' and the king of Israel said unto him, Right is your judgment; you hast determined it.'
\v 41 And he hasteth and turneth aside the ashes from off his eyes, and the king of Israel discerneth him, that he is of the prophets,
\v 42 and he said unto him, 'Thus said Yahweh, Because you hast sent away the man I devoted, out of your hand, even your life had been for his life, and your people for his people;'
\v 43 and the king of Israel went unto his house, sulky and wroth, and came in to Samaria.
\c 21
\v 1 And it came to pass, after these things, a vineyard had been to Naboth the Jezreelite, that is in Jezreel, near the palace of Ahab king of Samaria,
\v 2 and Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying, 'Give to me your vineyard, and it is to me for a garden of green herbs, for it is near by my house, and I give to thee in its stead a better vineyard than it; if good in yours eyes, I give to thee silver — its price.'
\v 3 And Naboth said unto Ahab, 'Far be it from me, by Yahweh, my giving the inheritance of my fathers to thee;'
\v 4 and Ahab came in unto his house, sulky and wroth, because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken unto him when he said, 'I do not give to thee the inheritance of my fathers,' and he lieth down on his bed, and turneth round his face, and had not eaten bread.
\v 5 And Jezebel his wife came in unto him, and spoke unto him, 'What is this? — your spirit sulky, and you art not eating bread!'
\v 6 And he said unto her, 'Because I speak unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and say to him, Give to me your vineyard for money, or if you desire, I give to thee a vineyard in its stead; and he said, I do not give to thee my vineyard.'
\v 7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, 'Thou now will execute rule over Israel! rise, eat bread, and let your heart be glad, — I do give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'
\v 8 And she writeth letters in the name of Ahab, and sealeth with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders, and unto the freemen, who are in his city, those dwelling with Naboth,
\v 9 and she writeth in the letters, saying, 'Proclaim a fast, and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people,
\v 10 and cause two men — sons of worthlessness — to sit over-against him, and they testify of him, saying, Thou hast blessed God and Melech; and they have brought him out, and stoned him, and he dieth.'
\v 11 And the men of his city, the elders and the freemen who are dwelling in his city, do as Jezebel had sent unto them, as written in the letters that she sent unto them,
\v 12 they have proclaimed a fast, and caused Naboth to sit at the head of the people,
\v 13 and two men — sons of worthlessness — come in, and sit over-against him, and the men of worthlessness testify of him, even Naboth, before the people, saying, 'Naboth blessed God and Melech;' and they take him out to the outside of the city, and stone him with stones, and he dieth;
\v 14 and they send unto Jezebel, saying, 'Naboth was stoned, and is dead.'
\v 15 And it came to pass, at Jezebel's hearing that Naboth had been stoned, and is dead, that Jezebel said unto Ahab, 'Rise, possess the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, that he refused to give to thee for money, for Naboth is not alive but dead.'
\v 16 And it came to pass, at Ahab's hearing that Naboth is dead, that Ahab riseth to go down unto the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to possess it.
\v 17 And the word of Yahweh is unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 18 Rise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria, — lo, in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he had gone down to possess it,
\v 19 and you hast spoken unto him, saying, Thus said Yahweh, Hast you murdered, and also possessed? and you hast spoken unto him, saying, Thus said Yahweh, In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, do the dogs lick your blood, even yours.'
\v 20 And Ahab said unto Elijah, 'Hast you found me, O mine enemy?' and he said, 'I have found — because of your selling yourself to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh;
\v 21 lo, I am bringing in unto thee evil, and have taken away your posterity, and cut off to Ahab those sitting on the wall, and restrained, and left, in Israel,
\v 22 and given up your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you hast provoked Me, and will cause Israel to sin.
\v 23 'And also of Jezebel had Yahweh spoken, saying, The dogs do eat Jezebel in the bulwark of Jezreel;
\v 24 him who dieth of Ahab in a city do the dogs eat, and him who dieth in a field do fowl of the heavens eat;
\v 25 surely there had none been like Ahab, who sold himself to do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife had moved,
\v 26 and he did very abominably to go after the idols, according to all that the Amorite did whom Yahweh dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel.'
\v 27 And it came to pass, at Ahab's hearing these words, that he rendeth his garments, and putteth sackcloth on his flesh, and fasteth, and lieth in sackcloth, and went gently.
\v 28 And the word of Yahweh is unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 29 'Hast you seen that Ahab had been humbled before Me? because that he had been humbled before Me, I bring not in the evil in his days; in the days of his son I bring in the evil on his house.'
\c 22
\v 1 And they sit still three years, there is no war between Aram and Israel,
\v 2 and it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat king of Judah came down unto the king of Israel,
\v 3 and the king of Israel said unto his servants, 'Have ye not known that ours is Ramoth-Gilead? and we are keeping silent from taking it out of the hand of the king of Aram!'
\v 4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, 'Dost you go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead?' and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, 'As I am, so you; as my people, so your people; as my horses, so your horses.'
\v 5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, 'Seek, I pray thee, to-day, the word of Yahweh;'
\v 6 and the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, about four hundred men, and said unto them, 'Do I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?' and they say, 'Go up, and the Lord did give it into the hand of the king.'
\v 7 And Jehoshaphat said, 'Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh besides, and we seek by him?'
\v 8 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, 'Yet — one man to seek Yahweh by him, and I have hated him, for he did not prophesy concerning me good, but evil — Micaiah son of Imlah;' and Jehoshaphat said, 'Let not the king say so.'
\v 9 And the king of Israel called unto a certain eunuch, and said, 'Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.'
\v 10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, in a threshing-floor, at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets are prophesying before them.
\v 11 And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and said, 'Thus said Yahweh, By these you will push the Aramaeans till they are consumed;'
\v 12 and all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, 'Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper, and Yahweh had given it into the hand of the king.'
\v 13 And the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah had spoken unto him, saying, 'Lo, I pray thee, the words of the prophets, with one mouth, are good towards the king; let it be, I pray thee, your word as the word of one of them — and you hast spoken good.'
\v 14 And Micaiah said, 'Yahweh lived; surely that which Yahweh said unto me — it I speak.'
\v 15 And he came in unto the king, and the king said unto him, 'Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead, to battle, or do we forbear?' and he said unto him, 'Go up, and prosper, and Yahweh had given it into the hand of the king.'
\v 16 And the king said unto him, 'How many times am I adjuring thee that you speak nothing unto me but truth in the name of Yahweh?'
\v 17 And he said, 'I have seen all Israel scattered on the hills as sheep that have no shepherd, and Yahweh said, These have no master; they turn back each to his house in peace.'
\v 18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, 'Have I not said unto thee, He did not prophesy of me good, but evil?'
\v 19 And he said, 'Therefore, hear a word of Yahweh; I have seen Yahweh sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing by Him, on His right and on His left;
\v 20 and Yahweh said, Who did entice Ahab, and he did go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? and this one said thus, and that one is saying thus.
\v 21 And the spirit went out, and standeth before Yahweh, and said, I — I do entice him; and Yahweh said unto him, By what?
\v 22 and he said, I go out, and have been a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets; and He said, Thou will entice, and also you art able; go out and do so.
\v 23 And now, lo, Yahweh had put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these your prophets, and Yahweh had spoken concerning thee — evil.'
\v 24 And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah draweth nigh, and smiteth Micaiah on the cheek, and said, 'Where is this — he had passed over — the Spirit of Yahweh — from me to speak with thee?'
\v 25 And Micaiah said, 'Lo, you art seeing on that day, when you goest in to the innermost chamber to be hidden.'
\v 26 And the king of Israel said, 'Take Micaiah, and turn him back unto Amon head of the city, and unto Joash son of the king,
\v 27 and you hast said, Thus said the king, Place ye this one in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat bread of oppression, and water of oppression, till my coming in peace.'
\v 28 And Micaiah said, 'If you at all return in peace — Yahweh had not spoken by me;' and he said, 'Hear, O peoples, all of them.'
\v 29 And the king of Israel went up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, to Ramoth-Gilead.
\v 30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat to disguise himself, and to go into battle, 'And you, put on your garments.' And the king of Israel disguiseth himself, and went into battle.
\v 31 And the king of Aram commanded the heads of the charioteers whom he had — thirty and two — saying, 'Ye do not fight with small or with great, but with the king of Israel by himself.'
\v 32 And it came to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing Jehoshaphat, that they said, 'He is only the king of Israel;' and they turn aside to him to fight, and Jehoshaphat crieth out,
\v 33 and it came to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing that he is not the king of Israel, that they turn back from after him.
\v 34 And a man had drawn with a bow, in his simplicity, and smiteth the king of Israel between the joinings and the coat of mail, and he said to his charioteer, 'Turn your hand, and take me out from the camp, for I have become sick.'
\v 35 And the battle increaseth on that day, and the king had been caused to stand in the chariot, over-against Aram, and he dieth in the evening, and the blood of the wound runneth out unto the middle of the chariot,
\v 36 and he caused the cry to pass over through the camp, at the going in of the sun, saying, 'Each unto his city, and each unto his land.'
\v 37 And the king dieth, and came into Samaria, and they bury the king in Samaria;
\v 38 and one rinseth the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs lick his blood — when the armour they had washed — according to the word of Yahweh that He spake.
\v 39 And the rest of the matters of Ahab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory that he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 40 And Ahab lieth with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 41 And Jehoshaphat son of Asa had reigned over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel,
\v 42 Jehoshaphat is a son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
\v 43 And he walketh in all the way of Asa his father, he had not turned aside from it, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh; only the high places have not turned aside, yet are the people sacrificing and making perfume in high places.
\v 44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel;
\v 45 and the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he got, and with which he fought, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 46 And the remnant of the whoremongers who were left in the days of Asa his father he took away out of the land;
\v 47 and there is no king in Edom; he set up a king.
\v 48 Jehoshaphat made ships at Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, and they went not, for the ships were broken in Ezion-Geber.
\v 49 Then said Ahaziah son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, 'Let my servants go with your servants in the ships;' and Jehoshaphat was not willing.
\v 50 And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoram his son reigneth in his stead.
\v 51 Ahaziah son of Ahab had reigned over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigneth over Israel two years,
\v 52 and did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, and walketh in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin,
\v 53 and serveth the Baal, and boweth himself to it, and provoketh Yahweh, God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
