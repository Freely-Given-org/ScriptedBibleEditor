\v 1 A word of Yahweh that had been unto Micah the Morashite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, that he had seen concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:
\v 2 Hear, O peoples, all of them! Attend, O earth, and its fulness, And the Lord Yahweh is against you for a witness, The Lord from His holy temple.
\v 3 For lo, Yahweh is going out from His place, And He had come down, And had trodden on high places of earth.
\v 4 Melted have been the mountains under Him, And the valleys do rend themselves, As wax from the presence of fire, As waters cast down by a slope.
\v 5 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
\v 6 And I have set Samaria for a heap of the field, For plantations of a vineyard, And poured out into a valley her stones, And her foundations I uncover.
\v 7 And all her graven images are beaten down, And all her gifts are burnt with fire, And all her idols I make a desolation, For, from the hire of a harlot she gathered, and unto the hire of a harlot they return.
\v 8 For this I lament and howl, I go spoiled and naked, I make a lamentation like dragons, And a mourning like daughters of an ostrich.
\v 9 For mortal are her wounds, For it had come unto Judah, It had come to a gate of My people — to Jerusalem.
\v 10 In Gath tell ye not — in Acco weep not, In Beth-Aphrah, in dust roll yourself.
\v 11 Pass over for thee, O inhabitant of Shaphir, Naked one of shame. Not gone out had the inhabitant of Zaanan, The lamentation of Beth-Ezel did take from you its standing.
\v 12 For stayed for good had the inhabitant of Maroth, For evil had come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.
\v 13 Bind the chariot to a swift beast, O inhabitant of Lachish, The beginning of sin is she to the daughter of Zion, For in thee have been found the transgressions of Israel.
\v 14 Therefore you givest presents to Moresheth-Gath, The houses of Achzib become a lying thing to the kings of Israel.
\v 15 Yet the possessor I do bring in to thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, To Adullam come in did the honour of Israel.
\v 16 Make bald and shave, for your delightful sons, Enlarge your baldness as an eagle, For they have removed from thee!
\c 2
\v 1 Woe to those devising iniquity, And working evil on their beds, In the light of the morning they do it, For their hand is — to God.
\v 2 And they have desired fields, And they have taken violently, And houses, and they have taken away, And have oppressed a man and his house, Even a man and his inheritance.
\v 3 Therefore, thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am devising against this family evil, From which ye do not remove your necks, Nor walk loftily, for a time of evil it is.
\v 4 In that day did one take up for you a simile, And he had wailed a wailing of woe, He had said, We have been utterly spoiled, The portion of my people He did change, How did He move toward me! To the backslider our fields He apportioneth.
\v 5 Therefore, you hast no caster of a line by lot In the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 6 Ye do not prophesy — they do prophesy, They do not prophesy to these, It did not remove shame.
\v 7 Doth the house of Jacob say, 'Hath the Spirit of Yahweh been shortened? Are these His doings?' Do not My words benefit the people that is walking uprightly?
\v 8 And yesterday My people for an enemy did raise himself up, From the outer garment the honourable ornament ye strip off, From the confident passers by, Ye who are turning back from war.
\v 9 The women of My people ye cast out from its delightful house, From its sucklings ye take away My honour to the age.
\v 10 Rise and go, for this is not the rest, Because of uncleanness it did corrupt, And corruption is powerful.
\v 11 If one is going with the wind, And with falsehood had lied: 'I prophesy to thee of wine, and of strong drink,' He had been the prophet of this people!
\v 12 I do surely gather thee, O Jacob, all of thee, I surely bring together the remnant of Israel, Together I do set it as the flock of Bozrah, As a drove in the middle of its pasture, It made a noise because of man.
\v 13 Gone up had the breaker before them, They have broken through, Yea, they pass through the gate, Yea, they go out through it, And pass on did their king before them, And Yahweh at their head!
\c 3
\v 1 And I say, 'Hear, I pray you, heads of Jacob, And ye judges of the house of Israel, Is it not for you to know the judgment?
\v 2 Ye who are hating good, and loving evil, Taking violently their skin from off them, And their flesh from off their bones,
\v 3 And who have eaten the flesh of My people, And their skin from off them have stript, And their bones they have broken, And they have spread them out as in a pot, And as flesh in the middle of a caldron.
\v 4 Then do they cry unto Yahweh, And He did not answer them, And hideth His face from them at that time, As they have made evil their doings.
\v 5 Thus said Yahweh concerning the prophets Who are causing My people to err, Who are biting with their teeth, And have cried 'Peace,' And he who did not give unto their mouth, They have sanctified against him war.
\v 6 Therefore a night ye have wiyout vision, And darkness ye have wiyout divination, And gone in had the sun on the prophets, And black over them had been the day.
\v 7 And ashamed have been the seers, And confounded have been the diviners, And covered their lip have all of them, For their is no answer, O God.
\v 8 And yet I have been full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh, And of judgment, and of might, To declare to Jacob his transgression, And to Israel his sin.
\v 9 Hear this, I pray you, heads of the house of Jacob, And ye judges of the house of Israel, Who are making judgment abominable, And all uprightness do pervert.
\v 10 Building up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity.
\v 11 Her heads for a bribe do judge, And her priests for hire do teach, And her prophets for silver divine, And on Yahweh they lean, saying, 'Is not Yahweh in our middle? Evil did not come in upon us.'
\v 12 Therefore, for your sake, Zion is ploughed a field, and Jerusalem is heaps, And the mount of the house is for high places of a forest!
\c 4
\v 1 And it had come to pass, In the latter end of the days, The mount of the house of Yahweh Is established above the top of the mounts, And it had been lifted up above the hills, And flowed unto it have peoples.
\v 2 And gone have many nations and said, Come and we go up to the mount of Yahweh, And unto the house of the God of Jacob, And He did teach us of His ways, And we do walk in His paths, For from Zion did go forth a law, And a word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\v 3 And He had judged between many peoples, And given a decision to mighty nations afar off, They have beaten their swords to ploughshares, And their spears to pruning-hooks, Nation lifteth not up sword unto nation, Nor do they learn war any more.
\v 4 And they have sat each under his vine, And under his fig-tree, And there is none troubling, For the mouth of Yahweh of Hosts had spoken.
\v 5 For all the peoples do walk, Each in the name of its god — and we, We do walk in the name of Yahweh our God, To the age and for ever.
\v 6 In that day — an affirmation of Yahweh, I do gather the halting one, And the driven away one I bring together, And she whom I have afflicted.
\v 7 And I have set the halting for a remnant, And the far-off for a mighty nation, And reigned had Yahweh over them in mount Zion, From henceforth, and unto the age.
\v 8 And you, O tower of Eder, Fort of the daughter of Zion, unto thee it came, Yea, come in had the former rule, The kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.
\v 9 Now, why will you shout aloud? A king — is there none in thee? Hath your counsellor perished, That taken hold of thee had pain as a travailing woman?
\v 10 Be pained, and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, As a travailing woman, For now, you goest forth from the city, And you hast dwelt in the field, And you hast gone unto Babylon, There you art delivered, There redeem thee did Yahweh from the hand of yours enemies.
\v 11 And now, gathered against thee have been many nations, who are saying: 'Let her be defiled, and our eyes look on Zion.'
\v 12 They have not known the youghts of Yahweh, Nor have they understood His counsel, For He had gathered them as a sheaf into a threshing-floor.
\v 13 Arise, and thresh, O daughter of Zion, For your horn I make iron, And your hoofs I make brass, And you hast beaten small many peoples, And I have devoted to Yahweh their gain, And their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth!
\c 5
\v 1 Now gather yourself together, O daughter of troops, A siege he had laid against us, With a rod they smite on the cheek the judge of Israel.
\v 2 And you, Beth-Lehem Ephratah, Little to be among the chiefs of Judah! From thee to Me he came forth — to be ruler in Israel, And his comings forth are of old, From the days of antiquity.
\v 3 Therefore he did give them out till the time She who brought forth had brought forth, And the remnant of his brethren return to the sons of Israel.
\v 4 And he had stood and delighted in the strength of Yahweh, In the excellency of the name of Yahweh his God, And they have remained, For now he is great unto the ends of earth.
\v 5 And this one had been peace, Asshur! when he did come into our land, And when he did tread in our palaces, We have raised against him seven shepherds, And eight anointed of man.
\v 6 And they have afflicted the land of Asshur with the sword, And the land of Nimrod at its openings, And he had delivered from Asshur when he did come into our land, And when he treadeth in our borders.
\v 7 And the remnant of Jacob had been in the middle of many peoples, As dew from Yahweh — as showers on the herb, That waiteth not for man, nor stayeth for the sons of men.
\v 8 Yea, the remnant of Jacob had been among nations, In the middle of many peoples, As a lion among beasts of a forest, As a young lion among ranks of a flock, Which if it had passed through, Hath both trodden down and had torn, And there is no deliverer.
\v 9 High is your hand above yours adversaries, And all yours enemies are cut off.
\v 10 And it had come to pass in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh, I have cut off your horses from your middle, And I have destroyed your chariots,
\v 11 And I have cut off the cities of your land, And I have thrown down all your fortresses,
\v 12 And have cut off sorcerers out of your hand, And observers of clouds you hast none.
\v 13 And I have cut off your graven images, And your standing-pillars out of your middle, And you will not bow yourself any more To the work of your hands.
\v 14 And I have plucked up your shrines out of your middle, And I have destroyed yours enemies.
\v 15 And I have done vengeance in anger and in fury, With the nations who have not hearkened!
\c 6
\v 1 Hear, I pray you, that which Yahweh is saying: 'Rise — strive you with the mountains, And cause you the hills to hear your voice.'
\v 2 Hear, O mountains, the strife of Yahweh, Ye strong ones — foundations of earth! For a strife is to Yahweh, with His people, And with Israel He did reason.
\v 3 O My people, what have I done to thee? And what — have I wearied thee? Testify against Me.
\v 4 For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, And from the house of servants I have ransomed thee, And I send before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
\v 5 O My people, remember, I pray you, What counsel did Balak king of Moab, What answer him did Balaam son of Beor, (From Shittim unto Gilgal,) In order to know the righteous acts of Yahweh.'
\v 6 With what do I come before Yahweh? Do I bow to God Most High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves — sons of a year?
\v 7 Is Yahweh pleased with yousands of rams? With myriads of streams of oil? Do I give my first-born for my transgression? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
\v 8 He had declared to thee, O man, what is good; Yea, what is Yahweh requiring of thee, Except — to do judgment, and love kindness, And lowly to walk with your God?
\v 9 A voice of Yahweh to the city called, And wisdom did fear Your name, Hear ye the rod, and Him who appointed it.
\v 10 Are there yet in the house of the wicked Treasures of wickedness, And the abhorred scanty ephah?
\v 11 Do I reckon it pure with balances of wickedness? And with a bag of deceitful stones?
\v 12 Whose rich ones have been full of violence, And its inhabitants have spoken falsehood, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
\v 13 And I also, I have begun to smite thee, To make desolate, because of your sins.
\v 14 Thou — you eatest, and you art not satisfied, And your pit is in your middle, And you removest, and will not deliver, And that which you deliverest, to a sword I give.
\v 15 Thou — you sowest, and you will not reap, Thou — you treadest the olive, And you pourest not out oil, And new wine — and you drinkest not wine.
\v 16 And kept habitually are the statutes of Omri, And all the work of the house of Ahab, And ye do walk in their counsels, For My giving thee for a desolation, And its inhabitants for a hissing, And the reproach of My people ye do bear!
\c 7
\v 1 My woe is to me, for I have been As gatherings of summer-fruit, As gleanings of harvest, There is no cluster to eat, The first-ripe fruit desired had my soul.
\v 2 Perished had the kind out of the land, And upright among men — there are none, All of them for blood lie in wait, Each his brother they hunt with a net.
\v 3 On the evil are both hands to do it well, The prince is asking — also the judge — for recompence, And the great — he is speaking the mischief of his soul, And they wrap it up.
\v 4 Their best one is as a brier, The upright one — than a thorn-hedge, The day of your watchmen — Your visitation — had come. Now is their perplexity.
\v 5 Believe not in a friend, trust not in a leader, From her who is lying in your bosom keep the openings of your mouth.
\v 6 For a son is dishonouring a father, A daughter had stood against her mother, A daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, The enemies of each are the men of his house.
\v 7 And I — in Yahweh I do watch, I do wait for the God of my salvation, Hear me did my God.
\v 8 Thou will not rejoice over me, O mine enemy, When I have fallen, I have risen, When I sit in darkness Yahweh is a light to me.
\v 9 The indignation of Yahweh I do bear, For I have sinned against Him, Till that He did plead my cause, And had executed my judgment, He did bring me forth to the light, I look on His righteousness.
\v 10 And see did mine enemy, And cover her did shame, Who said unto me, 'Where is Yahweh your God?' Mine eyes do look on her, Now she is for a treading-place, As mire of the out-places.
\v 11 The day to build your walls! That day — removed is the limit.
\v 12 That day — even unto thee it did come in, From Asshur and the cities of the fortress, And from the fortress even unto the river, And from sea to sea, and mount to mount.
\v 13 And the land had been for a desolation, Because of its inhabitants, Because of the fruit of their doings.
\v 14 Rule Thou Your people with Your rod, The flock of Thine inheritance, Dwelling alone in a forest in the middle of Carmel, They enjoy Bashan and Gilead as in days of old.
\v 15 According to the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt, I do shew it wonderful things.
\v 16 See do nations, and they are ashamed of all their might, They lay a hand on the mouth, their ears are deaf.
\v 17 They lick dust as a serpent, as fearful things of earth, They tremble from their enclosures, Of Yahweh our God they are afraid, Yea, they are afraid of Thee.
\v 18 Who is a God like Thee? taking away iniquity, And passing by the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance, He had not retained for ever His anger, Because He — He delighteth in kindness.
\v 19 He did turn back, He pitieth us, He did subdue our iniquities, And Thou castest into the depths of the sea all their sins.
\v 20 Thou givest truth to Jacob, kindness to Abraham, That you hast sworn to our fathers, from the days of antiquity!
