\v 1 The Visions of Isaiah son of Amoz, that he had seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\v 2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, For Yahweh had spoken: Sons I have nourished and brought up, And they — they transgressed against Me.
\v 3 An ox had known its owner, And an ass the crib of its master, Israel had not known, My people had not understood.
\v 4 Ah, sinning nation, a people heavy with iniquity, A seed of evil doers, sons — corrupters! They have forsaken Yahweh, They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have gone away backward.
\v 5 Wherefore are you stricken any more? Ye do add apostasy! Every head is become diseased, and every heart is sick.
\v 6 From the sole of the foot — unto the head, There is no soundness in it, Wound, and bruise, and fresh smiting! They have not been closed nor bound, Nor have they softened with ointment.
\v 7 Your land is a desolation, your cities burnt with fire, Your ground, before you strangers are consuming it, And a desolation as overthrown by strangers!
\v 8 And left had been the daughter of Zion, As a booth in a vineyard, As a lodge in a place of cucumbers — as a city besieged.
\v 9 Unless Yahweh of Hosts had left to us a remnant, Shortly — as Sodom we had been, To Gomorrah we had been like!
\v 10 Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom, Give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah,
\v 11 Why to Me the abundance of your sacrifices? said Yahweh, I have been satiated with burnt-offerings of rams, And fat of fatlings; And blood of bullocks, and lambs, And he-goats I have not desired.
\v 12 When you come in to appear before Me, Who had required this of your hand, To trample My courts?
\v 13 Add not to bring in a vain present, Incense — an abomination it is to Me, New moon, and sabbath, calling of convocation! Rendure not iniquity — and a restraint!
\v 14 Your new moons and your set seasons had My soul hated, They have been upon me for a burden, I have been weary of bearing.
\v 15 And in your spreading forth your hands, I hide mine eyes from you, Also when you increase prayer, I do not hear, Your hands of blood have been full.
\v 16 Wash you, make you pure, Turn aside the evil of your doings, from before Mine eyes, Cease to do evil, learn to do good.
\v 17 Seek judgment, make happy the oppressed, Judge the fatherless, strive for the widow.
\v 18 Come, I pray you, and we reason, said Yahweh, If your sins are as scarlet, as snow they shall be white, If they are red as crimson, as wool they shall be!
\v 19 If you are willing, and have hearkened, The good of the land you consume,
\v 20 And if you refuse, and have rebelled, By the sword you are consumed, For the mouth of Yahweh had spoken.
\v 21 How had a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it with judgment, Righteousness lodgeth in it — now murderers.
\v 22 Your silver had become dross, Your drink polluted with water.
\v 23 Your princes are apostates, and companions of thieves, Every one loving a bribe, and pursuing rewards, The fatherless they judge not, And the plea of the widow came not to them.
\v 24 Therefore — the affirmation of the Lord — Yahweh of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I am eased of Mine adversaries, And I am avenged of Mine enemies,
\v 25 And I turn back My hand upon you, And I refine as purity your dross, And I turn aside all your tin,
\v 26 And I give back your judges as at the first, And your counsellors as in the beginning, After this you are called, 'A city of righteousness — a faithful city.'
\v 27 Zion in judgment is redeemed, And her captivity in righteousness.
\v 28 And the destruction of transgressors and sinners is together, And those forsaking Yahweh are consumed.
\v 29 For men are ashamed because of the oaks That you have desired, And you are confounded because of the gardens That you have chosen.
\v 30 For you are as an oak whose leaf is fading, And as a garden that had no water.
\v 31 And the strong had been for tow, And his work for a spark, And burned have both of them together, And there is none quenching!
\c 2
\v 1 The thing that Isaiah son of Amoz had seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
\v 2 And it had come to pass, In the latter end of the days, Established is the mount of Yahweh's house, Above the top of the mounts, And it had been lifted up above the heights, And flowed unto it have all the nations.
\v 3 And gone have many peoples and said, 'Come, and we go up unto the mount of Yahweh, Unto the house of the God of Jacob, And He did teach us of His ways, And we walk in His paths, For from Zion went forth a law, And a word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\v 4 And He had judged between the nations, And had given a decision to many peoples, And they have beat their swords to ploughshares, And their spears to pruning-hooks, Nation did not lift up sword unto nation, Nor do they learn any more — war.
\v 5 O house of Jacob, come, And we walk in the light of Yahweh.'
\v 6 For You hast left Your people, the house of Jacob. For they have been filled from the east, And are sorcerers like the Philistines, And with the children of strangers strike hands.
\v 7 And its land is full of silver and gold, And there is no end to its treasures, And its land is full of horses, And there is no end to its chariots,
\v 8 And its land is full of idols, To the work of its hands it boweth itself, To that which its fingers have made,
\v 9 And the low boweth down, and the high is humbled, And You acceptest them not.
\v 10 Enter into a rock, and be hidden in dust, Because of the fear of Yahweh, And because of the honour of His excellency.
\v 11 The haughty eyes of man have been humbled, And bowed down had been the loftiness of men, And set on high had Yahweh alone been in that day.
\v 12 For a day is to Yahweh of Hosts, For every proud and high one, And for every lifted up and low one,
\v 13 And for all cedars of Lebanon, The high and the exalted ones, And for all oaks of Bashan,
\v 14 And for all the high mountains, And for all the exalted heights,
\v 15 And for every high tower, And for every fenced wall,
\v 16 And for all ships of Tarshish, And for all desirable pictures.
\v 17 And bowed down had been the haughtiness of man, And humbled the loftiness of men, And set on high had Yahweh alone been in that day.
\v 18 And the idols — they completely pass away.
\v 19 And men have entered into caverns of rocks, And into caves of dust, Because of the fear of Yahweh, And because of the honour of His excellency, In His rising to terrify the earth.
\v 20 In that day did man cast his idols of silver, And his idols of gold, That they have made for him to worship, To moles, and to bats,
\v 21 To enter into cavities of the rocks, And into clefts of the high places, Because of the fear of Yahweh, And because of the honour of His excellency, In His rising to terrify the earth.
\v 22 Cease for you from man, Whose breath is in his nostrils, For — in what is he esteemed?
\c 3
\v 1 For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Is turning aside from Jerusalem, And from Judah, stay and staff, Every stay of bread, and every stay of water.
\v 2 Hero and man of war, judge and prophet, And diviner and elder,
\v 3 Head of fifty, and accepted of faces, And counsellor, and the wise of artificers, And the intelligent of charmers.
\v 4 And I have made youths their heads, And sucklings rule over them.
\v 5 And the people had exacted — man upon man, Even a man on his neighbour, Enlarge themselves do the youths against the aged, And the lightly esteemed against the honoured.
\v 6 When one laid hold on his brother, Of the house of his father, by the garment, 'Come, a ruler you are to us, And this ruin is under your hand.'
\v 7 He lifteth up, in that day, saying: 'I am not a binder up, And in my house is neither bread nor garment, Ye do not make me a ruler of the people.'
\v 8 For stumbled had Jerusalem, and Judah had fallen, For their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, To provoke the eyes of His glory.
\v 9 The appearance of their faces witnessed against them, And their sin, as Sodom, they declared, They have not hidden! Woe to their soul, For they have done to themselves evil.
\v 10 Say you to the righteous, that it is good, Because the fruit of their doings they eat.
\v 11 Woe to the wicked — evil, Because the deed of his hand is done to him.
\v 12 My people — its exactors are sucklings, And women have ruled over it. My people — your eulogists are causing to err, And the way of your paths swallowed up.
\v 13 Yahweh had stood up to plead, And He is standing to judge the peoples.
\v 14 Yahweh into judgment did enter With elders of His people, and its heads: 'And you, you have consumed the vineyard, Plunder of the poor is in your houses.
\v 15 What — to you? you bruise My people, And the faces of the poor you grind.' An affirmation of the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, And Yahweh said:
\v 16 Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty, And they walk stretching out the neck, And deceiving with the eyes, Walking and mincing they go, And with their feet they make a tinkling,
\v 17 The Lord also had scabbed The crown of the head of daughters of Zion, And Yahweh their simplicity exposeth.
\v 18 In that day did the Lord turn aside The beauty of the tinkling ornaments, And of the embroidered works, And of the round tires like moons,
\v 19 Of the drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
\v 20 Of the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, And of the bands, And of the perfume boxes, and the amulets,
\v 21 Of the seals, and of the nose-rings,
\v 22 Of the costly apparel, and of the mantles, And of the coverings, and of the purses,
\v 23 Of the mirrors, and of the linen garments, And of the hoods, and of the vails,
\v 24 And it had been, instead of spice is muck, And instead of a girdle, a rope, And instead of curled work, baldness, And instead of a stomacher a girdle of sackcloth.
\v 25 For instead of glory, your men by sword do fall, And your might in battle.
\v 26 And lamented and mourned have her openings, Yea, she had been emptied, on the earth she sitteth!
\c 4
\v 1 And taken hold have seven women on one man, In that day, saying, 'Our own bread we do eat, And our own raiment we put on, Only, let your name be called over us, Remove you our reproach.'
\v 2 In that day is the Shoot of Yahweh for desire and for honour, And the fruit of the earth For excellence and for beauty to the escaped of Israel.
\v 3 And it had been, he who is left in Zion, And he who is remaining in Jerusalem, 'Holy' is said of him, Of every one who is written for life in Jerusalem.
\v 4 If the Lord had washed away The filth of daughters of Zion, And the blood of Jerusalem purgeth from her middle, By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
\v 5 Then had Yahweh prepared Over every fixed place of Mount Zion, And over her convocations, A cloud by day, and smoke, And the shining of a flaming fire by night, That, over all honour a safe-guard,
\v 6 And a covering may be, For a shadow by day from drought, And for a refuge, and for a hiding place, From inundation and from rain!
\c 5
\v 1 Let me sing, I pray you, for my beloved, A song of my beloved as to his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard in a fruitful hill,
\v 2 And he fenceth it, and threw out its stones, And planted it with a choice vine, And built a tower in its middle, And also a wine press had hewn out in it, And he waiteth for the yielding of grapes, And it yieldeth bad ones!
\v 3 And now, O inhabitant of Jerusalem, and man of Judah, Judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
\v 4 What — to do still to my vineyard, That I have not done in it! Wherefore, I waited to the yielding of grapes, And it yieldeth bad ones!
\v 5 And now, pray, let me cause you to know, That which I am doing to my vineyard, To turn aside its hedge, And it had been for consumption, To break down its wall, And it had been for a treading-place.
\v 6 And I make it a waste, It is not pruned, nor arranged, And gone up have brier and thorn, And on the thick clouds I lay a charge, From raining upon it rain.
\v 7 Because the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts Is the house of Israel, And the man of Judah His pleasant plant, And He waiteth for judgment, and behold, oppression, For righteousness, and behold, a cry.
\v 8 Woe to those joining house to house, Field to field they bring near, till there is no place, And you have been settled by yourselves In the middle of the land!
\v 9 By the weapons of Yahweh of Hosts Do not many houses a desolation become? Great and good without inhabitant!
\v 10 For ten acres of vineyard do yield one bath, And an homer of seed yieldeth an ephah.
\v 11 Woe to those rising early in the morning, Strong drink they pursue! Tarrying in twilight, wine inflameth them!
\v 12 And harp, and psaltery, tabret, and pipe, And wine, have been their banquets, And the work of Yahweh they behold not, Yea, the work of His hands they have not seen.
\v 13 Therefore my people removed without knowledge, And its honourable ones are famished, And its multitude dried up of thirst.
\v 14 Therefore had Sheol enlarged herself, And had opened her mouth without limit. And gone down had its honour, and its multitude, And its noise, and its exulting one — into her.
\v 15 And bowed down is the low, and humbled the high, And the eyes of the haughty become low,
\v 16 And Yahweh of Hosts is high in judgment, And the Holy God sanctified in righteousness,
\v 17 And fed have lambs according to their leading, And waste places of the fat ones Do sojourners consume.
\v 18 Woe to those drawing out iniquity with cords of vanity, And as with thick ropes of the cart — sin.
\v 19 Who are saying, 'Let Him hurry, Let Him hasten His work, that we may see, And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel Draw near and come, and we know.'
\v 20 Woe to those saying to evil 'good,' And to good 'evil,' Putting darkness for light, and light for darkness, Putting bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.
\v 21 Woe to the wise in their own eyes, And — before their own faces — intelligent!
\v 22 Woe to the mighty to drink wine, And men of strength to mingle strong drink.
\v 23 Declaring righteous the wicked for a bribe, And the righteousness of the righteous They turn aside from him.
\v 24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire devoureth stubble, And flaming hay falleth, Their root is as muck, And their flower as dust went up. Because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Hosts, And the saying of the Holy One of Israel despised.
\v 25 Therefore had the anger of Yahweh burned among His people, And He stretcheth out His hand against it, And smiteth it, and the mountains tremble, And their carcase is as filth in the middle of the out-places. With all this His anger did not turn back, And still His hand is stretched out!
\v 26 And He lifted up an ensign to nations afar off, And hissed to it from the end of the earth, And behold, with haste, swift it came.
\v 27 There is none weary, nor stumbling in it, It did not slumber, nor sleep, Nor opened had been the girdle of its loins, Nor drawn away the latchet of its sandals.
\v 28 Whose arrows are sharp, and all its bows bent, Hoofs of its horses as flint have been reckoned, And its wheels as a hurricane!
\v 29 Its roaring is like a lioness, It roareth like young lions, And it howleth, and seizeth prey, And carrieth away safely, and there is none delivering.
\v 30 And it howleth against it in that day as the howling of a sea, And it had looked attentively to the land, And behold, darkness — distress, And light had been darkened by its abundance!
\c 6
\v 1 In the year of the death of king Uzziah — I see the Lord, sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train is filling the temple.
\v 2 Seraphs are standing above it: six wings had each one; with two each covereth its face, and with two each covereth its feet, and with two each flieth.
\v 3 And this one had called unto that, and had said: 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is Yahweh of Hosts, The fulness of all the earth is His glory.'
\v 4 And the posts of the thresholds are moved by the voice of him who is calling, and the house is full of smoke.
\v 5 And I say, 'Woe to me, for I have been silent, For a man — unclean of lips am I, And in middle of a people unclean of lips I am dwelling, Because the King, Yahweh of Hosts, have my eyes seen.'
\v 6 And flee unto me did one of the seraphs, and in his hand a burning coal, (with tongs he had taken it from off the altar,)
\v 7 and he striketh against my mouth, and said: 'Lo, this had stricken against your lips, And turned aside is yours iniquity, And your sin is covered.'
\v 8 And I hear the voice of the Lord, saying: 'Whom do I send? and who did go for Us?' And I say, 'Here am I, send me.'
\v 9 And He said, 'Go, and you hast said to this people, Hear you — to hear, and you do not understand, And see you — to see, and you do not know.
\v 10 Declare fat the heart of this people, And its ears declare heavy, And its eyes declare dazzled, Lest it see with its eyes, And with its ears hear, and its heart consider, And it had turned back, and had health.'
\v 11 And I say, 'Till when, O Lord?' And He said, 'Surely till cities have been wasted without inhabitant, And houses without man, And the ground be wasted — a desolation,
\v 12 And Yahweh had put man far off, And great is the forsaken part in the heart of the land.
\v 13 And yet in it a tenth, and it had turned, And had been for a burning, As a teil-tree, and as an oak, that in falling, Have substance in them, The holy seed is its substance!'
\c 7
\v 1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, gone up had Rezin king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to battle against it, and he is not able to fight against it.
\v 2 And it is declared to the house of David, saying, 'Aram had been led towards Ephraim,' And his heart and the heart of his people is moved, like the moving of trees of a forest by the presence of wind.
\v 3 And Yahweh said unto Isaiah, 'Go forth, I pray you, to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-Jashub your son, unto the end of the conduit of the upper pool, unto the highway of the fuller's field,
\v 4 and you hast said unto him: 'Take heed, and be quiet, fear not, And let not your heart be timid, Because of these two tails of smoking brands, For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin and Aram, And the son of Remaliah.
\v 5 Because that Aram counselled against you evil, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying:
\v 6 We go up into Judah, and we vex it, And we rend it unto ourselves, And we cause a king to reign in its middle — The son of Tabeal.
\v 7 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: It did not stand, nor shall it be!
\v 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus, And the head of Damascus is Rezin, And within sixty and five years Is Ephraim broken from being a people.
\v 9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not give credence, Surely you are not stedfast.'
\v 10 And Yahweh addeth to speak unto Ahaz, saying:
\v 11 Ask for you a sign from Yahweh your God, Make deep the request, or make it high upwards.'
\v 12 And Ahaz said, 'I do not ask nor try Yahweh.'
\v 13 And he said, 'Hear, I pray you, O house of David, Is it a little thing for you to weary men, That you weary also my God?
\v 14 Therefore the Lord Himself gave to you a sign, Lo, the Virgin is conceiving, And is bringing forth a son, And had called his name Immanuel,
\v 15 Butter and honey he did eat, When he knoweth to refuse evil, and to fix on good.
\v 16 For before the youth did know To refuse evil, and to fix on good, Forsaken is the land you are vexed with, because of her two kings.
\v 17 Yahweh brought on you, and on your people, And on the house of your father, Days that have not come, Even from the day of the turning aside of Ephraim from Judah, By the king of Asshur.
\v 18 And it had come to pass, in that day, Yahweh did hiss for a fly that is in the extremity of the brooks of Egypt, And for a bee that is in the land of Asshur.
\v 19 And they have come, and rested all of them in the desolate valleys, And in holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, And on all the commendable things.
\v 20 In that day did the Lord shave, By a razor that is hired beyond the river, By the king of Asshur, The head, and the hair of the feet, Yea, also the beard it consumeth.
\v 21 And it had come to pass, in that day, A man keepeth alive a heifer of the herd, And two of the flock,
\v 22 And it had come to pass, From the abundance of the yielding of milk he eateth butter, For butter and honey did every one eat Who is left in the heart of the land.
\v 23 And it had come to pass, in that day, Every place where there are a thousand vines, At a thousand silverlings, Is for briers and for thorns.
\v 24 With arrows and with bow he came thither, Because all the land is brier and thorn.
\v 25 And all the hills that with a mattock are kept in order, Thither came not the fear of brier and thorn, And it had been for the sending forth of ox, And for the treading of sheep!'
\c 8
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Take to you a great tablet, and write upon it with a graving tool of man, To haste spoil, enjoy prey.'
\v 2 And I cause faithful witnesses to testify to me, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.
\v 3 And I draw near unto the prophetess, and she conceiveth, and beareth a son; and Yahweh said unto me, 'Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,
\v 4 for before the youth did know to cry, My father, and My mother, one took away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria, before the king of Asshur.'
\v 5 And Yahweh addeth to speak unto me again, saying:
\v 6 'Because that this people had refused The waters of Shiloah that go softly, And is rejoicing with Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
\v 7 Therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up on them, The waters of the river, the mighty and the great, (The king of Asshur, and all his glory,) And it had gone up over all its streams, And had gone on over all its banks.
\v 8 And it had passed on into Judah, It had overflown and passed over, Unto the neck it came, And the stretching out of its wings Hath been the fulness of the breadth of your land, O Emmanu-El!
\v 9 Be friends, O nations, and be broken, And give ear, all you far off ones of earth, Gird yourselves, and be broken, Gird yourselves, and be broken.
\v 10 Take counsel, and it is broken, Speak a word, and it did not stand, Because of Emmanu-El!'
\v 11 For thus had Yahweh spoken unto me with strength of hand, and instructeth me against walking in the way of this people, saying,
\v 12 'Ye do not say, A confederacy, To all to whom this people said, A confederacy, And its fear you do not fear, Nor declare fearful.
\v 13 Yahweh of Hosts — Him you do sanctify, And He is your Fear, and He your Dread,
\v 14 And He had been for a sanctuary, And for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of falling, To the two houses of Israel, For a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 15 And many among them have stumbled and fallen, And been broken, and snared, and captured.
\v 16 Bind up the testimony, Seal the law among My disciples.
\v 17 And I have waited for Yahweh, Who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob, And I have looked for Him.
\v 18 Lo, I, and the children whom Yahweh had given to me, Are for signs and for wonders in Israel, From Yahweh of Hosts, who is dwelling in Mount Zion.
\v 19 And when they say unto you, 'Seek unto those having familiar spirits, And unto wizards, who chatter and mutter, Doth not a people seek unto its God? — For the living unto the dead!
\v 20 To the law and to the testimony! If not, let them say after this manner, 'That there is no dawn to it.'
\v 21  — And it had passed over into it, hardened and hungry, And it had come to pass, That it is hungry, and had been wroth, And made light of its king, and of its God, And had looked upwards.
\v 22 And unto the land it looketh attentively, And behold, adversity and darkness! — Dimness, distress, and thick darkness is driven away, But not the dimness for which she is in distress!
\c 9
\v 1 As the former time made light The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, So the latter had honoured the way of the sea, Beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
\v 2 The people who are walking in darkness Have seen a great light, Dwellers in a land of death-shade, Light had shone upon them.
\v 3 You hast multiplied the nation, You hast made great its joy, They have joyed before Thee as the joy in harvest, As men rejoice in their apportioning spoil.
\v 4 Because the yoke of its burden, And the staff of its shoulder, the rod of its exactor, You hast broken as in the day of Midian.
\v 5 For every battle of a warrior is with rushing, and raiment rolled in blood, And it had been for burning — fuel of fire.
\v 6 For a Child had been born to us, A Son had been given to us, And the princely power is on his shoulder, And He did call his name Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace.
\v 7 To the increase of the princely power, And of peace, there is no end, On the throne of David, and on his kingdom, To establish it, and to support it, In judgment and in righteousness, Henceforth, even unto the age, The zeal of Yahweh of Hosts did this.
\v 8 A word had the Lord sent into Jacob, And it had fallen in Israel.
\v 9 And the people have known — all of it, Ephraim, and the inhabitant of Samaria, In pride and in greatness of heart, saying,
\v 10 'Bricks have fallen, and hewn work we build, Sycamores have been cut down, and cedars we renew.'
\v 11 And Yahweh setteth the adversaries of Rezin on high above him, And his enemies he joineth together,
\v 12 Aram from before, and Philistia from behind, And they devour Israel with the whole mouth. With all this not turned back had His anger, And still His hand is stretched out.
\v 13 And the people had not turned back unto Him who is smiting it, And Yahweh of Hosts they have not sought.
\v 14 And Yahweh cutteth off from Israel head and tail, Branch and reed — the same day,
\v 15 Elder, and accepted of face, he is the head, Prophet, teacher of falsehood, he is the tail.
\v 16 And the eulogists of this people are causing to err, And its eulogised ones are consumed.
\v 17 Therefore, over its young men the Lord rejoiceth not, And its orphans, and its widows He pitieth not, For every one is profane, and an evil doer, And every mouth is speaking folly. With all this not turned back had His anger, And still His hand is stretched out.
\v 18 For burned as a fire had wickedness, Brier and thorn it devoureth, And it kindleth in thickets of the forest, And they lift themselves up, an exaltation of smoke!
\v 19 In the wrath of Yahweh of Hosts Hath the land been consumed, And the people is as fuel of fire; A man on his brother had no pity,
\v 20 And cutteth down on the right, and had been hungry, And he devoureth on the left, And they have not been satisfied, Each the flesh of his own arm they devour.
\v 21 Manasseh — Ephraim, and Ephraim — Manasseh, Together they are against Judah, With all this not turned back had His anger. And still His hand is stretched out!
\c 10
\v 1 Woe to those decreeing decrees of iniquity, And writers who have prescribed perverseness.
\v 2 To turn aside from judgment the poor, And to take violently away the judgment Of the afflicted of My people, That widows may be their prey, That the fatherless they may spoil.
\v 3 And what do you at a day of inspection? And at desolation? — from afar it came. Near whom do you flee for help? And where do you leave your honour?
\v 4 Without Me it had bowed down In the place of a bound one, And in the place of the killed they fall. With all this not turned back had His anger, And still His hand is stretched out.
\v 5 Woe to Asshur, a rod of Mine anger, And a staff in their hand is Mine indignation.
\v 6 Against a profane nation I send him, And concerning a people of My wrath I charge him, To spoil spoil, and to seize prey, And to make it a treading-place as the clay of out places.
\v 7 And he — he thinketh not so, And his heart reckoneth not so, For — to destroy is in his heart, And to cut off nations not a few.
\v 8 For he said, 'Are not my princes altogether kings?
\v 9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?
\v 10 As my hand had got to the kingdoms of a worthless thing, and their graven images, Greater than Jerusalem and than Samaria,
\v 11 Do I not — as I have done to Samaria, And to her worthless things, So do to Jerusalem and to her grievous things?
\v 12 And it had come to pass, When the Lord did fulfil all His work In mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I see concerning the fruit of the greatness Of the heart of the king of Asshur. And concerning the glory of the height of his eyes.
\v 13 For he had said, 'By the power of my hand I have wrought, And by my wisdom, for I have been intelligent, And I remove borders of the peoples, And their chief ones I have spoiled, And I put down as a mighty one the inhabitants,
\v 14 And my hand as to a nest Getteth to the wealth of the peoples, And as a gathering of forsaken eggs All the earth I — I have gathered, And there had not been one moving wing, Or opening mouth, or whispering.'
\v 15  — Doth the axe glorify itself Against him who is hewing with it? Doth the saw magnify itself Against him who is shaking it? As a rod waving those lifting it up! As a staff lifting up that which is not wood!
\v 16 Therefore did the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, Send among his fat ones leanness, And under his honour He kindleth a burning As the burning of a fire.
\v 17 And the light of Israel had been for a fire, And his Holy One for a flame, And it had burned, and devoured his thorn And his brier in one day.
\v 18 And the honour of his forest, and his fruitful field, From soul even unto flesh He did consume, And it had been as the fainting of a standard-bearer.
\v 19 And the rest of the trees of his forest are few, And a youth did write them.
\v 20 And it had come to pass, in that day, The remnant of Israel, And the escaped of the house of Jacob, Do not add any more to lean on its smiter, And have leant on Yahweh, The Holy One of Israel, in truth.
\v 21 A remnant returneth — a remnant of Jacob, Unto the Mighty God.
\v 22 For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, A remnant did return of it, A consumption determined, Overflowing with righteousness.
\v 23 For a consumption that is determined, The Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Is making in the middle of all the land.
\v 24 Therefore, thus said the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, 'Be not afraid, my people, inhabiting Zion, because of Asshur, With a rod he did smite you, And his staff lifteth up against you, in the way of Egypt.
\v 25 For yet a very little, And the indignation had been completed, And Mine anger by their wearing out.
\v 26 And awaking for him is Yahweh of Hosts, A scourge like the smiting of Midian at the rock Oreb, And his rod is over the sea, And he had lifted it in the way of Egypt.
\v 27 And it had come to pass, in that day, Turned is his burden from off your shoulder, And his yoke from off your neck, And destroyed had been the yoke, because of prosperity.
\v 28 He had come in against Aiath, He had passed over into Migron, At Michmash he looketh after his vessels.
\v 29 They have gone over the passage, Geba they have made a lodging place, Trembled had Rama, Gibeah of Saul fled.
\v 30 Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim, Give attention, Laish! answer her, Anathoth.
\v 31 Fled away had Madmenah, The inhabitants of the high places have hardened themselves.
\v 32 Yet to-day in Nob to remain, Wave its hand did the mount of the daughter of Zion, The hill of Jerusalem.
\v 33 Lo, the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Is lopping a branch with violence, And the high of stature are cut down, And the lofty are become low,
\v 34 And He had gone round the thickets of the forest with iron, And Lebanon by a mighty one falleth!
\c 11
\v 1 And a rod had come out from the stock of Jesse, And a branch from his roots is fruitful.
\v 2 Rested on him had the Spirit of Yahweh, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and might, The spirit of knowledge and fear of Yahweh.
\v 3 To refresh him in the fear of Yahweh, And by the sight of his eyes he judgeth not, Nor by the hearing of his ears decideth.
\v 4 And he had judged in righteousness the poor, And decided in uprightness for the humble of earth, And had smitten earth with the rod of his mouth, And with the breath of his lips he putteth the wicked to death.
\v 5 And righteousness had been the girdle of his loins, And faithfulness — the girdle of his reins.
\v 6 And a wolf had sojourned with a lamb, And a leopard with a kid did lie down, And calf, and young lion, and fatling are together, And a little youth is leader over them.
\v 7 And cow and bear do feed, Together lie down their young ones, And a lion as an ox eateth straw.
\v 8 And played had a suckling by the hole of an asp, And on the den of a cockatrice Hath the weaned one put his hand.
\v 9 Evil they do not, nor destroy in all My holy mountain, For full had been the earth with the knowledge of Yahweh, As the waters are covering the sea.
\v 10 And there had been, in that day, A root of Jesse that is standing for an ensign of peoples, Unto him do nations seek, And his rest had been — honour!
\v 11 And it had come to pass, in that day, The Lord addeth a second time his power, To get the remnant of His people that is left, From Asshur, and from Egypt, And from Pathros, and from Cush, And from Elam, and from Shinar, And from Hamath, and from isles of the sea,
\v 12 And He had lifted up an ensign to nations, And gathereth the driven away of Israel, And the scattered of Judah He assembleth, From the four wings of the earth.
\v 13 And turned aside had the envy of Ephraim, And the adversaries of Judah are cut off, Ephraim did not envy Judah, And Judah did not distress Ephraim.
\v 14 And they have flown on the shoulder of the Philistines westward, Together they spoil the sons of the east, Edom and Moab sending forth their hand, And sons of Ammon obeying them.
\v 15 And Yahweh had devoted to destruction The tongue of the sea of Egypt, And had waved His hand over the river, In the terror of his wind, And had smitten it at the seven streams, And had caused men to tread it with shoes.
\v 16 And there had been a highway, For the remnant of His people that is left, from Asshur, As there was for Israel in the day of his coming up out of the land of Egypt!
\c 12
\v 1 And you hast said in that day: 'I thank you, O Yahweh, Yough You hast been angry with me, Turn back did Thine anger, And You will comfort me.
\v 2 Lo, God is my salvation, I trust, and fear not, For my strength and song is Jah Yahweh, And He is to me for salvation.
\v 3 And you have drawn waters with joy Out of the fountains of salvation,
\v 4 And you have said in that day, Give you praise to Yahweh, call in His name. Make known among the peoples His acts. Make mention that set on high is His name.
\v 5 Praise you Yahweh, for excellence He had done, Known is this in all the earth.
\v 6 Cry aloud, and sing, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in your middle is the Holy One of Israel!'
\c 13
\v 1 The burden of Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz had seen:
\v 2 'On a high mountain lift you up an ensign, Raise the voice to them, wave the hand, And they go in to the openings of nobles.
\v 3 I have given charge to My sanctified ones, Also I have called My mighty ones for Mine anger, Those rejoicing at Mine excellency.'
\v 4 A voice of a multitude in the mountains, A likeness of a numerous people, A voice of noise from the kingdoms of nations who are gathered, Yahweh of Hosts inspecting a host of battle!
\v 5 They are coming in from a land afar off, From the end of the heavens, Yahweh and the instruments of His indignation, To destroy all the land.
\v 6 Howl you, for near is the day of Yahweh, As destruction from the Mighty it came.
\v 7 Therefore, all hands do fail, And every heart of man did melt.
\v 8 And they have been troubled, Pains and pangs they take, As a travailing woman they are pained, A man at his friend they marvel, The appearance of flames — their faces!
\v 9 Lo, the day of Yahweh did come, Fierce, with wrath, and heat of anger, To make the land become a desolation, Yea, its sinning ones He destroyeth from it.
\v 10 For the stars of the heavens, and their constellations, Cause not their light to shine, Darkened had been the sun in its going out, And the moon caused not its light to come forth.
\v 11 And I have appointed on the world evil, And on the wicked their iniquity, And have caused to cease the excellency of the proud, And the excellency of the terrible I make low.
\v 12 I make man more rare than fine gold, And a common man than pure gold of Ophir.
\v 13 Therefore the heavens I cause to tremble, And the earth did shake from its place, In the wrath of Yahweh of Hosts, And in a day of the heat of his anger.
\v 14 And it had been, as a roe driven away, And as a flock that had no gatherer, Each unto his people — they turn, And each unto his land — they flee.
\v 15 Every one who is found is thrust through, And every one who is added falleth by sword.
\v 16 And their sucklings are dashed to pieces before their eyes, Spoiled are their houses, and their wives lain with.
\v 17 Lo, I am stirring up against them the Medes, Who silver esteem not, And gold — they delight not in it.
\v 18 And bows dash young men to pieces, And the fruit of the womb they pity not, On sons their eye had no pity.
\v 19 And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, The glory, the excellency of the Chaldeans, Hath been as overthrown by God, With Sodom and with Gomorrah.
\v 20 She did not sit for ever, Nor continueth unto many generations, Nor did Arab pitch tent there, And shepherds lie not down there.
\v 21 And Ziim have lain down there, And full have been their houses of howlings, And dwelt there have daughters of an ostrich, And goats do skip there.
\v 22 And Aiim have responded in his forsaken habitations, And dragons in palaces of delight, And near to come is her time, And her days are not drawn out!
\c 14
\v 1 Because Yahweh loveth Jacob, And had fixed again on Israel, And given them rest on their own land, And joined had been the sojourner to them, And they have been admitted to the house of Jacob.
\v 2 And peoples have taken them, And have brought them in unto their place, And the house of Israel have inherited them, On the land of Yahweh, For men-servants and for maid-servants, And they have been captors of their captors, And have ruled over their exactors.
\v 3 And it had come to pass, In the day of Yahweh's giving rest to you, From your grief, and from your trouble, And from the sharp bondage, That had been served upon you,
\v 4 That you hast taken up this simile Concerning the king of Babylon, and said, How had the exactor ceased,
\v 5 Ceased had the golden one. Broken had Yahweh the staff of the wicked, The sceptre of rulers.
\v 6 He who is smiting peoples in wrath, A smiting without intermission, He who is ruling in anger nations, Pursuing without restraint!
\v 7 At rest — quiet had been all the earth, They have broken forth into singing.
\v 8 Even firs have rejoiced over you, Cedars of Lebanon — saying: Since you hast lain down, The hewer came not up against us.
\v 9 Sheol beneath had been troubled at you, To meet your coming in, It is waking up for you Rephaim, All chiefs ones of earth, It had raised up from their thrones All kings of nations.
\v 10 All of them answer and say unto you, Even you hast become weak like us! Unto us you hast become like!
\v 11 Brought down to Sheol had been yours excellency, The noise of your psaltery, Under you spread out had been the worm, Yea, covering you is the worm.
\v 12 How hast you fallen from the heavens, O shining one, son of the dawn! You hast been cut down to earth, O weakener of nations.
\v 13 And you saidst in your heart: the heavens I go up, Above stars of God I raise my throne, And I sit in the mount of meeting in the sides of the north.
\v 14 I go up above the heights of a thick cloud, I am like to the Most High.
\v 15 Only — unto Sheol you are brought down, Unto the sides of the pit.
\v 16 Your beholders look to you, to you they attend, Is this the man causing the earth to tremble, Shaking kingdoms?
\v 17 He had made the world as a wilderness, And his cities he had broken down, Of his bound ones he opened not the house.
\v 18 All kings of nations — all of them, Have lain down in honour, each in his house,
\v 19 And — you hast been cast out of your grave, As an abominable branch, raiment of the killed, Thrust through ones of the sword, Going down unto the sons of the pit, As a carcase trodden down.
\v 20 You are not united with them in burial, For your land you hast destroyed, Your people you hast killed, Not named to the age is the seed of evil doers.
\v 21 Prepare you for his sons slaughter; Because of the iniquity of their fathers, They rise not, nor have possessed the land, Nor filled the face of the world with cities.
\v 22 And I have risen up against them, (The affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts,) And have cut off, in reference to Babylon, Name and remnant, and continuator and successor, The affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 23 And have made it for a possession of a bittern, And ponds of waters, And daubed it with the mire of destruction, The affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts!
\v 24 Sworn had Yahweh of Hosts, saying, 'As I thought — so had it not been? And as I counselled — it standeth;
\v 25 To break Asshur in My land, And on My mountains I tread him down, And turned from off them had his yoke, Yea, his burden from off their shoulder turneth aside.
\v 26 This is the counsel that is counselled for all the earth, And this is the hand that is stretched out for all the nations.
\v 27 For Yahweh of Hosts had purposed, And who did make void? And His hand that is stretched out, Who did turn it back?'
\v 28 In the year of the death of king Ahaz was this burden:
\v 29 Rejoice not you, Philistia, all of you, That broken had been the rod of your smiter, For from the root of a serpent came out a viper, And its fruit is a flying saraph.
\v 30 And delighted have the first-born of the poor, And the needy in confidence lie down, And I have put to death with famine your root, And your remnant it slaid.
\v 31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city, Melted are you, Philistia, all of you, For from the north smoke had come, And there is none alone in his set places.
\v 32 And what did one answer the messengers of a nation? 'That Yahweh had founded Zion, And in it do the poor of His people trust!'
\c 15
\v 1 The burden of Moab. Because in a night destroyed was Ar of Moab — It had been cut off, Because in a night destroyed was Kir of Moab — It had been cut off.
\v 2 He had gone up to Bajith and Dibon, The high places — to weep, On Nebo and on Medeba Moab howleth, On all its heads is baldness, every beard cut off.
\v 3 In its out-places they girded on sackcloth, On its pinnacles, and in its broad places, Every one howleth — going down with weeping.
\v 4 And cry did Heshbon and Elealeh, Unto Jahaz heard had been their voice, Therefore the armed ones of Moab do shout, His life had been grievous to him.
\v 5 My heart is toward Moab, Cry do her fugitives unto Zoar, a heifer of the third year, For — the ascent of Luhith — With weeping he went up in it, For, in the way of Horonaim, A cry of destruction they wake up.
\v 6 For, the waters of Nimrim are desolations, For, withered had been the hay, Finished had been the tender grass, A green thing there had not been.
\v 7 Therefore the abundance he made, and their store, Unto the brook of the willows they carry.
\v 8 For gone round had the cry the border of Moab, Unto Eglaim is its howling, And to Beer-Elim is its howling.
\v 9 For the waters of Dimon have been full of blood, For I set on Dimon additions, For the escaped of Moab a lion, And for the remnant of Adamah!
\c 16
\v 1 Send you a lamb to the ruler of the land, From Selah in the wilderness, Unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
\v 2 And it had come to pass, As a wandering bird, a nest cast out, Are daughters of Moab, at fords of Arnon.
\v 3 Bring you in counsel, do judgment, Make as night your shadow in the middle of noon, Hide outcasts, the wanderer reveal not.
\v 4 Sojourn in you do My outcasts, O Moab, Be a secret hiding-place to them, From the face of a destroyer, For ceased had the extortioner, Finished had been a destroyer, Consumed the treaders down out of the land.
\v 5 And established in kindness is the throne, And one had sat on it in truth, in the tent of David, Judging and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
\v 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab — very proud, His pride, and his arrogance, and his wrath, Not right are his devices.
\v 7 Therefore howl did Moab for Moab, all of it did howl, For the grape-cakes of Kir-Hareseth it meditateth, Surely they are smitten.
\v 8 Because fields of Heshbon languish, The vine of Sibmah, Lords of nations did beat her choice vines, Unto Jazer they have come, They have wandered in a wilderness, Her plants have spread themselves, They have passed over a sea.
\v 9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer, The vine of Sibmah, I water you with my tear, O Heshbon and Elealeh, For — for your summer fruits, and for your harvest, The shouting had fallen.
\v 10 And removed have been gladness and joy from the fruitful field, And in vineyards they sing not, nor shout, Wine in the presses treadeth not the treader, Shouting I have caused to cease.
\v 11 Therefore my bowels for Moab as a harp do sound, And mine inward parts for Kir-Haresh.
\v 12 And it had come to pass, when it had been seen, That weary had been Moab on the high place, And he had come unto his sanctuary to pray, And is not able.
\v 13 This is the word that Yahweh had spoken unto Moab from that time,
\v 14 And now had Yahweh spoken, saying, 'In three years, as years of an hireling, Lightly esteemed is the honour of Moab, With all the great multitude, And the remnant is little, small, not mighty!'
\c 17
\v 1 The burden of Damascus. Lo, Damascus is taken away from being a city, And it had been a heap — a ruin.
\v 2 Forsaken are the cities of Aroer, For droves they are, and they have lain down, And there is none troubling.
\v 3 And ceased had the fortress from Ephraim, And the kingdom from Damascus, And the remnant of Aram are as the honour of the sons of Israel, The affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts!
\v 4 And it had come to pass, in that day, Wax poor did the honour of Jacob, And the fatness of his flesh did wax lean.
\v 5 And it had come to pass, As the gathering by the reaper of the standing corn, And his arm the ears reapeth, And it had come to pass, As the gathering of the ears in the valley of Rephaim,
\v 6 And left in him have been gleanings, As the compassing of an olive, Two — three berries on the top of a branch, Four — five on the fruitful boughs, The affirmation of Yahweh, God of Israel!
\v 7 In that day did man look to His Maker, Yea, his eyes to the Holy One of Israel look,
\v 8 And he looketh not unto the altars. The work of his own hands, And that which his own fingers made He saw not — the shrines and the images.
\v 9 In that day are the cities of his strength As the forsaken thing of the forest, And the branch that they have left, Because of the sons of Israel, It also had been a desolation.
\v 10 Because you hast forgotten the God of your salvation, And the rock of your strength hast not remembered, Therefore you plantest plants of pleasantness, And with a strange slip sowest it,
\v 11 In the day your plant you causest to become great, And in the morning your seed makest to flourish, A heap is the harvest in a day of overflowing, And of mortal pain.
\v 12 Woe to the multitude of many peoples, As the sounding of seas they sound; And to the wasting of nations, As the wasting of mighty waters they are wasted.
\v 13 Nations as the wasting of many waters are wasted, And He had pushed against it, And it had fled afar off, And been pursued as chaff of hills before wind, And as a rolling thing before a hurricane.
\v 14 At even-time, behold, terror, before morning it is not, This is the portion of our spoilers, And the lot of our plunderers!
\c 18
\v 1 Ho, land shadowed with wings, That is beyond the rivers of Cush,
\v 2 That is sending by sea ambassadors, Even with implements of reed on the face of the waters, — Go, you light messengers, Unto a nation drawn out and peeled, Unto a people fearful from its beginning and onwards, A nation meeting out by line, and treading down, Whose land floods have spoiled.
\v 3 All you inhabitants of the world, And you dwellers of earth, At the lifting up of an ensign on hills you look, And at the blowing of a trumpet you hear.
\v 4 For thus said Yahweh unto me, 'I rest, and I look on My settled place, As a clear heat on an herb. As a thick cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
\v 5 For before harvest, when the flower is perfect, And the blossom is producing unripe fruit, Then had one cut the sprigs with pruning hooks, And the branches he had turned aside, cut down.
\v 6 They are left together to the ravenous fowl of the mountains, And to the beast of the earth, And summered on them had the ravenous fowl, And every beast of the earth wintereth on them.
\v 7 At that time brought is a present to Yahweh of Hosts, A nation drawn out and peeled. Even of a people fearful from the beginning hitherto, A nation meting out by line, and treading down, Whose land floods have spoiled, Unto the place of the name of Yahweh of Hosts — mount Zion!'
\c 19
\v 1 The burden of Egypt. Lo, Yahweh is riding on a swift thick cloud, And He had entered Egypt, And moved have been the idols of Egypt at His presence, And the heart of Egypt melteth in its middle.
\v 2 And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, And they fought, each against his brother, And each against his neighbour, City against city, kingdom against kingdom.
\v 3 And emptied out had been in its middle the spirit of Egypt. And its counsel I swallow up, And they have sought unto the idols, And unto the charmers, And unto those having familiar spirits, And unto the wizards.
\v 4 And I have delivered the Egyptians Into the hand of a hard lord, And a strong king did rule over them, An affirmation of the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 5 And failed have waters from the sea, And a river is wasted and dried up.
\v 6 And they have turned away the flowings, Weak and dried up have been brooks of the bulwark, Reed and flag have withered.
\v 7 Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, And every sown thing of the brook, had withered, It had been driven away, and is not.
\v 8 And lamented have the fishers, And mourned have all casting angle into a brook, And those spreading nets on the face of the waters have languished.
\v 9 And ashamed have been makers of fine flax, And weavers of net-works.
\v 10 And its foundations have been smitten, All making wages are afflicted in soul.
\v 11 Only, fools are the princes of Zoan, The counsel of the wise ones of the counsellors of Pharaoh had become brutish. How say you unto Pharaoh, 'A son of the wise am I, a son of kings of antiquity?'
\v 12 Where are they now, your wise ones? Yea, let them tell to you, I pray you, And they know what Yahweh of Hosts had counselled against Egypt!
\v 13 Foolish have been princes of Zoan, Lifted up have been princes of Noph, And they have caused Egypt to err, The chief of her tribes.
\v 14 Yahweh had mingled in her middle A spirit of perverseness, And they have caused Egypt to err in all its work, As a drunkard erreth in his vomit.
\v 15 And there is no work to Egypt, That head or tail, branch or reed, may do.
\v 16 In that day is Egypt like women, And it had mourned, and been afraid, Because of the waving of the hand of Yahweh of Hosts, That He is waving over it.
\v 17 And the land of Judah had been to Egypt for a cause of staggering, Every one who did mention it, for himself feareth, Because of the counsel of Yahweh of Hosts, That He is counselling against it.
\v 18 In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt, Speaking the lip of Canaan, And swearing to Yahweh of Hosts, 'The city of destruction,' is said of one.
\v 19 In that day there is an altar to Yahweh In the middle of the land of Egypt, And a standing pillar near its border to Yahweh,
\v 20 And it had been for a sign and for a testimony, To Yahweh of Hosts in the land of Egypt, For they cry unto Yahweh from the face of oppressors, And He sent to them a saviour, Even a great one, and had delivered them.
\v 21 And known had been Yahweh to Egypt, And the Egyptians have known Yahweh in that day, And done sacrifice and present, And vowed a vow to Yahweh, and completed it.
\v 22 And Yahweh had smitten Egypt, smiting and healing, And they have turned back unto Yahweh, And He had been entreated of them, And had healed them.
\v 23 In that day is a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, And come in have the Assyrians to Egypt, And the Egyptians into Asshur, And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians.
\v 24 In that day is Israel third, After Egypt, and after Asshur, A blessing in the heart of the earth.
\v 25 In that Yahweh of Hosts did bless it, saying, 'Blessed is My people — Egypt, And the work of My hands — Asshur, And Mine inheritance — Israel!'
\c 20
\v 1 In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Asshur sent him, and he fighteth against Ashdod, and captureth it,
\v 2 at that time spake Yahweh by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, 'Go, and you hast loosed the sackcloth from off your loins, and your sandal you will draw from off your foot,' and he did so, going naked and barefoot.
\v 3 And Yahweh said, 'As My servant Isaiah had gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for Cush,
\v 4 so did the king of Asshur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the removal of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with seat uncovered — the nakedness of Egypt;
\v 5 and they have been frightened and ashamed of Cush their confidence, and of Egypt their beauty,
\v 6 and the inhabitant of this isle had said in that day — Lo, thus is our trust, Whither we have fled for help, To be delivered from the king of Asshur, And how do we escape — we?'
\c 21
\v 1 The burden of the wilderness of the sea. 'Like hurricanes in the south for passing through, From the wilderness it had come, From a fearful land.
\v 2 A hard vision had been declared to me, The treacherous dealer is dealing treacherously, And the destroyer is destroying. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Media, All its sighing I have caused to cease.
\v 3 Therefore filled have been my loins with great pain, Pangs have seized me as pangs of a travailing woman, I have been bent down by hearing, I have been troubled by seeing.
\v 4 Wandered had my heart, trembling had terrified me, The twilight of my desire He had made a fear to me,
\v 5 Arrange the table, watch in the watch-tower, Eat, drink, rise, you heads, anoint the shield,
\v 6 For thus said the Lord unto me: 'Go, station the watchman, That which he saw let him declare.'
\v 7 And he had seen a chariot — a couple of horsemen, The rider of an ass, the rider of a camel, And he had given attention — He had increased attention!
\v 8 And he crieth — a lion, 'On a watch-tower my lord, I am standing continually by day, And on my ward I am stationed whole nights.
\v 9 And behold, this, the chariot of a man is coming, A couple of horsemen.' And he answereth and said: 'Fallen, fallen had Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods He had broken to the earth.
\v 10 O my threshing, and the son of my floor, That which I heard from Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, I have declared to you!'
\v 11 The burden of Dumah. Unto me is one calling from Seir 'Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?'
\v 12 The watchman had said, 'Come had morning, and also night, If you inquire, inquire you, turn back, come.'
\v 13 The burden on Arabia. In a forest in Arabia you lodge, O travellers of Dedanim.
\v 14 To meet the thirsty brought water have Inhabitants of the land of Tema, With his bread they came before a fugitive.
\v 15 For from the face of destructions they fled, From the face of a stretched-out sword, And from the face of a trodden bow, And from the face of the grievousness of battle.
\v 16 For thus said the Lord unto me: 'Within a year, as years of a hireling, Consumed had been all the honour of Kedar.
\v 17 And the remnant of the number of bow-men, The mighty of the sons of Kedar are few, For Yahweh, God of Israel, had spoken!'
\c 22
\v 1 The burden of the Valley of Vision. What — to you, now, that you hast gone up, All of you — to the roofs?
\v 2 Full of stirs — a noisy city — an exulting city, Your pierced are not pierced of the sword, Nor dead in battle.
\v 3 All your rulers fled together from the bow, Bound have been all found of you, They have been kept bound together, Afar off they have fled.
\v 4 Therefore I said, 'Look you from me, I am bitter in my weeping, Haste not to comfort me, For the destruction of the daughter of my people.'
\v 5 For a day of noise, and of treading down, And of perplexity, is to the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, In the valley of vision, digging down a wall, And crying unto the mountain.
\v 6 And Elam had borne a quiver, In a chariot of men — horsemen, And Kir had exposed a shield.
\v 7 And it came to pass, The choice of your valleys have been full of chariots, And the horsemen place themselves diligently at the gate.
\v 8 And one removeth the covering of Judah, And you lookest in that day Unto the armour of the house of the forest,
\v 9 And the breaches of the city of David you have seen, For they have become many, And you gather the waters of the lower pool,
\v 10 And the houses of Jerusalem you did number, And you break down the houses to fence the wall.
\v 11 And a ditch you made between the two walls, For the waters of the old pool, And you have not looked unto its Maker, And its Framer of old you have not seen.
\v 12 And call did the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, In that day, to weeping and to lamentation, And to baldness and to girding on of sackcloth,
\v 13 And behold, joy and gladness, slaying of oxen, And slaughtering of sheep, Eating of flesh, and drinking of wine, Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
\v 14 And revealed it had been in mine ears, By Yahweh of Hosts: Not pardoned is this iniquity to you, Till you die, said the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 15 Thus said the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts: 'Go, enter in unto this steward, Unto Shebna, who is over the house:
\v 16 What — to you here? And who — to you here? That you hast hewn out to you here — a sepulchre? Hewing on high his sepulchre, Graving in a rock a dwelling for himself.
\v 17 Lo, Yahweh is casting you up and down, A casting up and down, O mighty one,
\v 18 And your coverer covering, wrapping round, Wrappeth you round, O babbler, On a land broad of sides — there you diest, And there the chariots of yours honour Are the shame of the house of your lord.
\v 19 And I have thrust you from your station, And from yours office he throweth you down.
\v 20 And it had come to pass, in that day, That I have called to my servant, To Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
\v 21 And I have clothed him with your coat, And with your girdle I strengthen him, And your garment I give into his hand, And he had been for a father to the inhabitant of Jerusalem, And to the house of Judah.
\v 22 And I have placed the key Of the house of David on his shoulder, And he had opened, and none is shutting, And had shut, and none is opening.
\v 23 And I have fixed him a nail in a stedfast place, And he had been for a throne of honour To the house of his father.
\v 24 And they have hanged on him All the honour of the house of his father, The offspring and the issue, All vessels of small quality, From vessels of basins to all vessels of flagons.
\v 25 In that day — an affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, Moved is the nail that is fixed In a stedfast place, Yea, it had been cut down, and had fallen, And cut off had been the burden that is on it, For Yahweh had spoken!'
\c 23
\v 1 The Burden of Tyre. Howl, you ships of Tarshish, For it had been destroyed, Without house, without entrance, From the land of Chittim it was revealed to them.
\v 2 Be silent, you inhabitants of the isle, Trader of Zidon, passing the sea, they filled you.
\v 3 And in many waters is the seed of Sihor, The harvest of the brook is her increase, And she is a mart of nations.
\v 4 Be ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea spake, The strength of the sea, saying: 'I have not been pained, nor have I brought forth, Nor have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.'
\v 5 As at the report of Egypt they are pained, So at the report of Tyre.
\v 6 Pass over to Tarshish, howl, you inhabitants of the isle,
\v 7 Is this your exulting one? From the days of old is her antiquity, Carry her do her own feet afar off to sojourn.
\v 8 Who had counselled this against Tyre, The crowning one, whose traders are princes, Her merchants the honoured of earth?'
\v 9 Yahweh of Hosts had counselled it, To pollute the excellency of all beauty, To make light all the honoured of earth.
\v 10 Pass through your land as a brook, Daughter of Tarshish, there is no more a girdle.
\v 11 His hand He had stretched out over the sea, He had caused kingdoms to tremble, Yahweh had charged concerning the merchant one, To destroy her strong places.
\v 12 And He said, 'You will not add any more to exult, O oppressed one, virgin daughter of Zidon, To Chittim arise, pass over, Even there — there is no rest for you.'
\v 13 Lo, the land of the Chaldeans — this people was not, Asshur founded it for the Ziim, They raised its watch-towers, They lifted up her palaces, — He had appointed her for a ruin!
\v 14 Howl, you ships of Tarshish, For your strength had been destroyed.
\v 15 And it had come to pass, in that day, That forgotten is Tyre seventy years, According to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years there is to Tyre as the song of the harlot.
\v 16 Take a harp, go round the city, O forgotten harlot, play well, Multiply song that you may be remembered.
\v 17 And it had come to pass, At the end of seventy years Yahweh inspecteth Tyre, And she had repented of her gift, That she committed fornication With all kingdoms of the earth on the face of the ground.
\v 18 And her merchandise and her gift have been holy to Yahweh, Not treasured up nor stored, For to those sitting before Yahweh is her merchandise, To eat to satiety, and for a lasting covering!
\c 24
\v 1 Lo, Yahweh is emptying the land, And is making it waste, And had overturned it on its face, And had scattered its inhabitants.
\v 2 And it had been — as a people so a priest, As the servant so his master, As the maid-servant so her mistress, As the buyer so the seller, As the lender so the borrower, As the usurer so he who is lifting it on himself.
\v 3 Utterly emptied is the land, and utterly spoiled, For Yahweh had spoken this word:
\v 4 Mourned, faded had the land, Languished, faded had the world, Languished have they — the high place of the people of the land.
\v 5 And the land had been defiled under its inhabitants, Because they have transgressed laws, They have changed a statute, They have made void a covenant age-during.
\v 6 Therefore a curse had consumed the land, And the inhabitants in it are become desolate, Therefore consumed have been inhabitants of the land, And few men have been left.
\v 7 Mourned had the new wine, languished the vine, Sighed have all the joyful of heart.
\v 8 Ceased had the joy of tabrets, Ceased had the noise of exulting ones, Ceased had the joy of a harp.
\v 9 With a song they drink not wine, Bitter is strong drink to those drinking it.
\v 10 It was broken down — a city of emptiness, Shut had been every house from entrance.
\v 11 A cry over the wine is in out-places, Darkened had been all joy, Removed had been the joy of the land.
\v 12 Left in the city is desolation, And with wasting is the gate smitten.
\v 13 When thus it is in the heart of the land, In the middle of the peoples, As the compassing of the olive, As gleanings when harvest had been finished,
\v 14 They — they lift up their voice, They sing of the excellency of Yahweh, They have cried aloud from the sea.
\v 15 Therefore in prosperity honour you Yahweh, In isles of the sea, the name of Yahweh, God of Israel.
\v 16 From the skirt of the earth we heard songs, The desire of the righteous. And I say, 'Leanness is to me, Leanness is to me, woe is to me.' Treacherous dealers dealt treacherously, Yea, treachery, treacherous dealers dealt treacherously.
\v 17 Fear, and a snare, and a gin, Are on you, O inhabitant of the land.
\v 18 And it had come to pass, He who is fleeing from the noise of the fear Doth fall into the snare, And he who is coming up from the middle of the snare, Is captured by the gin, For windows on high have been opened, And shaken are foundations of the land.
\v 19 Utterly broken down had been the land, Utterly broken had been the land, Utterly moved had been the land.
\v 20 Stagger greatly did the land as a drunkard, And it had been moved as a lodge, And heavy on it had been its transgression, And it had fallen, and addeth not to rise.
\v 21 And it had come to pass, in that day, Yahweh laid a charge on the host of the high place in the high place, And on the kings of the land on the land.
\v 22 And they have been gathered — A gathering of bound ones in a pit, And shut up they have been in a prison, And after a multitude of days are inspected.
\v 23 And confounded had been the moon, And ashamed had been the sun, For reigned had Yahweh of Hosts In mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, And over-against His elders — honour!
\c 25
\v 1 O Yahweh, my God are You, I exalt Thee, I confess Your name, For You hast done a wonderful thing, Counsels of old, stedfastness, O stedfast One.
\v 2 For You did make of a city a heap, Of a fenced city a ruin, A high place of strangers from being a city, To the age it is not built.
\v 3 Therefore honour Thee do a strong people, A city of the terrible nations feareth Thee.
\v 4 For You hast been a stronghold for the poor, A stronghold for the needy in his distress, A refuge from storm, a shadow from heat, When the spirit of the terrible is as a storm — a wall.
\v 5 As heat in a dry place, The noise of strangers You humblest, Heat with the shadow of a thick cloud, The singing of the terrible is humbled.
\v 6 And made had Yahweh of Hosts, For all the peoples in this mount, A banquet of fat things, a banquet of preserved things, Fat things full of marrow, preserved things refined.
\v 7 And swallowed up had He in this mountain The face of the wrapping that is wrapped over all the peoples, And of the covering that is spread over all the nations.
\v 8 He had swallowed up death in victory, And wiped had the Lord Yahweh, The tear from off all faces, And the reproach of His people He turneth aside from off all the earth, For Yahweh had spoken.
\v 9 And one had said in that day, 'Lo, this is our God, We waited for Him, and He saveth us, This is Yahweh, we have waited for Him, We joy and rejoice in His salvation.'
\v 10 For rest did the hand of Yahweh on this mountain, And trodden down is Moab under Him, As trodden down is straw on a dunghill.
\v 11 And he spread out his hands in its middle, As spread out did the swimmer to swim; And He had humbled his excellency With the machinations of his hands.
\v 12 And the fortress of the high place of your walls He had bowed down — He had made low, He had caused it to come to the earth, — unto dust.
\c 26
\v 1 In that day sung is this song in the land of Judah: 'We have a strong city, Salvation He did make walls and bulwark.
\v 2 Open you the gates, that enter may a righteous nation, Preserving stedfastness.
\v 3 An imagination supported You fortifiest peace — peace! For in Thee it is confident.
\v 4 Trust you in Yahweh for ever, For in Jah Yahweh is a rock of ages,
\v 5 For He bowed down the dwellers on high, A city set on high He made low, He made it low unto the earth, He caused it to come unto the dust,
\v 6 Tread it down did a foot, Feet of the poor — steps of the weak.
\v 7 The path for the righteous is uprightness, O upright One, The path of the righteous You will ponder.
\v 8 Also, in the path of Your judgments, O Yahweh, we have waited for Thee, To Your name and to Your remembrance Is the desire of the soul.
\v 9 With my soul I desired Thee in the night, Also, with my spirit within me I seek Thee earnestly, For when Your judgments are on the earth, The inhabitants of the world have learned righteousness.
\v 10 The wicked finds favour, He had not learned righteousness, In a land of straightforwardness he dealeth perversely, And saw not the excellency of Yahweh.
\v 11 O Yahweh, high is Your hand — they see not, They see the zeal of the people, and are ashamed, Also, the fire — Thine adversaries, consumeth them.
\v 12 O Yahweh, You appointest peace to us, For, all our works also You hast wrought for us.
\v 13 O Yahweh our God, lords have ruled us besides Thee, Only, by Thee we make mention of Your name.
\v 14 Dead — they live not, Rephaim, they rise not, Therefore You hast inspected and will destroy them, Yea, you destroyest all their memory.
\v 15 You hast added to the nation, O Yahweh, You hast added to the nation, You hast been honoured, You hast put far off all the ends of earth.
\v 16 O Yahweh, in distress they missed Thee, They have poured out a whisper, Your chastisement is on them.
\v 17 When a pregnant woman came near to the birth, She is pained — she crieth in her pangs, So we have been from Your face, O Yahweh.
\v 18 We have conceived, we have been pained. We have brought forth as it were wind, Salvation we do not work in the earth, Nor do the inhabitants of the world fall.
\v 19 Your dead live — My dead body they rise. Awake and sing, you dwellers in the dust, For the dew of herbs is your dew, And the land of Rephaim you causest to fall.
\v 20 Come, My people, enter into your inner chambers, And shut your doors behind you, Hide thyself shortly a moment till the indignation pass over.
\v 21 For, behold, Yahweh is coming out of His place, To charge the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him, And revealed had the earth her blood, Nor did she cover any more her killed!'
\c 27
\v 1 In that day lay a charge did Yahweh, With his sword — the sharp, and the great, and the strong, On leviathan — a fleeing serpent, And on leviathan — a crooked serpent, And He had killed the dragon that is in the sea.
\v 2 In that day, 'A desirable vineyard,' respond you to her,
\v 3 I, Yahweh, am its keeper, every moment I water it, Lest any lay a charge against it, Night and day I keep it!
\v 4 Fury is not in Me; Who gave Me a brier — a thorn in battle? I step into it, I burn it at once.
\v 5 Or — he did take hold on My strength, He did make peace with Me, Peace he did make with Me.
\v 6 Those coming in He caused to take root, Jacob did blossom, and flourished had Israel, And they have filled the face of the world with increase.
\v 7 As the smiting of his smiter had He smitten him? As the slaying of his killed did He slay?
\v 8 In measure, in sending it forth, you strivest with it, He had taken away by His sharp wind, In the day of an east wind,
\v 9 Therefore by this is the iniquity of Jacob covered, And this is all the fruit — To take away his sin, in His setting all the stones of an altar, As chalkstones beaten in pieces, They rise not — shrines and images.
\v 10 For the fenced city is alone, A habitation cast out and forsaken as a wilderness, There did the calf delight, And there it lieth down, And had consumed its branches.
\v 11 In the withering of its branch it is broken off, Women are coming in setting it on fire, For it is not a people of understanding, Therefore pity it not did its Maker, And its Former did not favour it.
\v 12 And it had come to pass, in that day, Beat out did Yahweh from the branch of the river, Unto the stream of Egypt, And you are gathered one by one, O sons of Israel.
\v 13 And it had come to pass, in that day, It is blown with a great trumpet, And come in have those perishing in the land of Asshur, And those cast out in the land of Egypt, And have bowed themselves to Yahweh, In the holy mount — in Jerusalem!
\c 28
\v 1 Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim. And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory, That is on the head of the fat valley of the broken down of wine.
\v 2 Lo, a mighty and strong one is to the Lord, As a storm of hail — a destructive shower, As an inundation of mighty waters overflowing, He cast down to the earth with the hand.
\v 3 By feet trodden down is the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim,
\v 4 And the fading flower of the beauty of his glory That is on the head of the fat valley, Hath been as its first-fruit before summer, That its beholder saw, While it is yet in his hand he swalloweth it.
\v 5 In that day is Yahweh of Hosts For a crown of beauty, and for a diadem of glory, To the remnant of His people.
\v 6 And for a spirit of judgment To him who is sitting in the judgment, And for might to those turning back the battle to the gate.
\v 7 And even these through wine have erred, And through strong drink have wandered, Priest and prophet erred through strong drink, They have been swallowed up of the wine, They wandered because of the strong drink, They have erred in seeing, They have stumbled judicially.
\v 8 For all tables have been full of vomit, Filth — without place!
\v 9 By whom did He teach knowledge? And by whom did He cause to understand the report? The weaned from milk, the removed from breasts,
\v 10 For rule is on rule, rule on rule, line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there,
\v 11 For by scorned lip, and by another tongue, Doth He speak unto this people.
\v 12 Unto whom He had said, 'This is the rest, give you rest to the weary, And this — the refreshing:' And they have not been willing to hear,
\v 13 And to whom a word of Yahweh had been, Rule on rule, rule on rule, line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there, So that they go and have stumbled backward, And been broken, and snared, and captured.
\v 14 Therefore, hear a word of Yahweh, you men of scorning, Ruling this people that is in Jerusalem.
\v 15 Because you have said: 'We have made a covenant with death, And with Sheol we have made a provision, An overflowing scourge, when it passeth over, Doth not meet us, Yough we have made a lie our refuge, And in falsehood have been hidden.'
\v 16 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: 'Lo, I am laying a foundation in Zion, A stone — a tried stone, a corner stone precious, a settled foundation, He who is believing did not make haste.
\v 17 And I have put judgment for a line, And righteousness for a plummet, And sweep away did hail the refuge of lies, And the secret hiding-place do waters overflow.
\v 18 And disannulled had been your covenant with death, And your provision with Sheol did not stand, An overflowing scourge, when it passeth over, Then you have been to it for a treading-place.
\v 19 From the fulness of its passing over it took you, For morning by morning it passeth over, By day and by night, And it had been only a trembling to consider the report.
\v 20 For shorter had been the bed Than to stretch one's self out in, And the covering had been narrower Than to wrap one's self up in.
\v 21 For as at mount Perazim rise did Yahweh, As at the valley in Gibeon He is troubled, To do His work — strange is His work, And to do His deed — strange is His deed.'
\v 22 And now, show not yourselves scorners, Lest strong be your bands, For a consumption, that is determined, I have heard, by the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Is for all the land.
\v 23 Give ear, and hear my voice, Attend, and hear my saying:
\v 24 The whole day plougheth the ploughman to sow? He opened and harroweth his ground!
\v 25 Hath he not, if he have made level its face, Then scattered fitches, and cummin sprinkle, And had placed the principal wheat, And the appointed barley, And the rie in its own border?
\v 26 And instruct him for judgment did his God, He did direct him.
\v 27 For not with a sharp-pointed thing threshed are fitches, And the wheel of a cart on cummin turned round, For with a staff beaten out are fitches, And cummin with a rod.
\v 28 Bread -corn is beaten small, For not for ever did he sorely thresh it, Nor crushed it had a wheel of his cart, Nor do his hoofs beat it small.
\v 29 Even this from Yahweh of Hosts had gone out, He had made counsel wonderful, He had made wisdom great!
\c 29
\v 1 Woe to Ariel, Ariel, The city of the encampment of David! Add year to year, let festivals go round.
\v 2 And I have sent distress to Ariel, And it had been lamentation and mourning, And it had been to me as Ariel.
\v 3 And I encamped, O babbler, against you, And I laid siege against you — a camp. And I raised up against you bulwarks.
\v 4 And you hast been low, From the earth you speakest, And from the dust makest your saying low, And your voice had been from the earth, As one having a familiar spirit, And from the dust your saying whisperest,
\v 5 And as small dust had been The multitude of those scattering you, And as chaff passing on the multitude of the terrible, And it had been at an instant — suddenly.
\v 6 By Yahweh of Hosts you are inspected, With thunder, and with an earthquake, And great noise, hurricane, and whirlwind, And flame of devouring fire.
\v 7 And as a dream, a vision of night, had been The multitude of all the nations Who are warring against Ariel, And all its warriors, and its bulwark, Even of those distressing her.
\v 8 And it had been, as when the hungry dreameth, And behold, he is eating, And he had waked, and empty is his soul, And as when the thirsty dreameth, And behold, he is drinking, and he had waked, And behold, he is weary, and his soul is longing, So is the multitude of all the nations Who are warring against mount Zion.
\v 9 Tarry and wonder, look you, yea, look, Be drunk, and not with wine, Stagger, and not with strong drink.
\v 10 For poured out on you had Yahweh a spirit of deep sleep, And He closeth your eyes — the prophets, And your heads — the seers — He covered.
\v 11 And the vision of the whole is to you, As words of the sealed book, That they give unto one knowing books, Saying, 'Read this, we pray you,' And he had said, 'I am not able, for it is sealed;'
\v 12 And the book is given to him who had not known books, Saying, 'Read this, we pray you,' And he had said, 'I have not known books.'
\v 13 And the Lord said: Because drawn near had this people, with its mouth, And with its lips they have honoured Me, And its heart it had put far off from Me, And their fear of Me is — A precept of men is taught!
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I am adding to do wonderfully with this people, A wonder, and a marvel, And perished had the wisdom of its wise ones, And the understanding of its intelligent ones hideth itself.'
\v 15 Woe to those going deep from Yahweh to hide counsel, And whose works have been in darkness. And they say, 'Who is seeing us? And who is knowing us?'
\v 16 Your perversion! as clay is the potter esteemed? That the work said of its maker, 'He had not made me?' And the framed thing said of its framer, 'He did not understand?'
\v 17 Is it not yet a very little, And turned had Lebanon to a fruitful field, And the fruitful field for a forest is reckoned?
\v 18 And heard in that day have the deaf the words of a book, And out of thick darkness, and out of darkness, The eyes of the blind do see.
\v 19 And the humble have added joy in Yahweh, And the poor among men In the Holy One of Israel rejoice.
\v 20 For ceased had the terrible one, And consumed had been the scorner, And cut off have been all watching for iniquity,
\v 21 Causing men to sin in word, And for a reprover in the gate lay a snare, And turn aside into emptiness the righteous.
\v 22 Therefore, thus said Yahweh, Who ransomed Abraham, Concerning the house of Jacob: 'Not now ashamed is Jacob, Nor now did his face become pale,
\v 23 For in his seeing his children, The work of My hand, in his middle, They sanctify My name, And have sanctified the Holy One of Jacob, And the God of Israel they declare fearful.
\v 24 And the erring in spirit have known understanding, And murmurers learn doctrine!'
\c 30
\v 1 Woe to apostate sons, The affirmation of Yahweh! To do counsel, and not from Me, And to spread out a covering, and not of My spirit, So as to add sin to sin.
\v 2 Who are walking to go down to Egypt, And My mouth have not asked, To be strong in the strength of Pharaoh, And to trust in the shadow of Egypt.
\v 3 And the strength of Pharaoh Hath been to you for shame, And the trust in the shadow of Egypt confusion,
\v 4 For in Zoan were his princes, And his messengers reach Hanes.
\v 5 All he made ashamed of a people that profit not, Neither for help, not for profit, But for shame, and also for reproach!
\v 6 The burden of the beasts of the south. Into a land of adversity and distress, Of young lion and of old lion, Whence are viper and flying saraph, They carry on the shoulder of asses their wealth, And on the hump of camels their treasures, Unto a people not profitable.
\v 7 Yea, Egyptians are vanity, and in vain do help, Therefore I have cried concerning this: 'Their strength is to sit still.'
\v 8 No, go in, write it on a tablet with them, And on a book engrave it, And it is for a latter day, for a witness unto the age,
\v 9 That a rebellious people is this, sons — liars, Sons not willing to hear the law of Yahweh.
\v 10 Who have said to seers, 'Ye do not see,' And to prophets, 'Ye do not prophesy to us Straightforward things, Speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits,
\v 11 Turn aside from the way, decline from the path, Cause to cease from before us the Holy One of Israel.'
\v 12 Therefore, thus said the Holy One of Israel, Because of your kicking against this word, And you trust in oppression, And perverseness, and rely on it,
\v 13 Therefore is this iniquity to you as a breach falling, Swelled out in a wall set on high, Whose destruction suddenly, at an instant came.
\v 14 And He had broken it As the breaking of the potters' bottle, Beaten down — He did not spare, Nor is there found, in its beating down, A potsherd to take fire from the burning, And to draw out waters from a ditch.
\v 15 For thus said the Lord Yahweh, The Holy One of Israel: 'In returning and rest you are saved, In keeping quiet and in confidence is your might, And you have not been willing.
\v 16 And you say, No, for on a horse we flee? Therefore you flee, And on the swift we ride! Therefore swift are your pursuers.
\v 17 One thousand because of the rebuke of one, Because of the rebuke of five you flee, Till you have been surely left as a pole On the top of the mountain, And as an ensign on the height.
\v 18 And therefore did wait Yahweh to favour you, And therefore He is exalted to pity you, For a God of judgment is Yahweh, O the blessedness of all waiting for Him.
\v 19 For the people in Zion dwell in Jerusalem, Weep you not, weeping, Pitying, He pitieth you at the voice of your cry, When He heareth He answereth you.
\v 20 And the Lord had given to you bread of adversity, And water of oppression. And your directors remove no more, And yours eyes have seen your directors,
\v 21 And yours ear heareth a word behind you, Saying, 'This is the way, go you in it,' When you turn to the right, And when you turn to the left.
\v 22 And you have defiled the covering of Your graven images of silver, And the ephod of your molten image of gold, You scatterest them as a sickening thing, 'Go out,' you sayest to it.
\v 23 And He had given rain for your seed, With which you will sow the ground, And bread, the increase of the ground, And it had been fat and plenteous, Enjoy do your cattle in that day an enlarged pasture.
\v 24 And the oxen and the young asses serving the ground, Fermented provender do eat, That one is winnowing with shovel and fan.
\v 25 And there had been on every high mount, And on every exalted hill, Rivulets — streams of waters, In a day of much slaughter, in the falling of towers.
\v 26 And the light of the moon had been as the light of the sun, And the light of the sun is sevenfold, As the light of seven days, In the day of Yahweh's binding up the breach of His people, When the stroke of its wound He healeth.
\v 27 Lo, the name of Yahweh is coming from far, Burning is His anger, and great the flame, His lips have been full of indignation, And His tongue is as a devouring fire.
\v 28 And His breath is as an overflowing stream, Unto the neck it divideth, To sift nations with a sieve of vanity, And a bridle causing to err, Is on the jaws of the peoples.
\v 29 Singing is to you as in a night sanctified for a festival, And joy of heart as he who is going with a pipe, To go in to the mountain of Yahweh, Unto the rock of Israel.
\v 30 And caused to be heard had Yahweh The honour of His voice, And the coming down of His arm He did shew with the raging of anger, And the flame of a consuming fire, Scattering, and inundation, and hailstone.
\v 31 For from the voice of Yahweh broken down is Asshur, With a rod He smiteth.
\v 32 And every passage of the settled staff, That Yahweh caused to rest on him, Hath been with tabrets, and with harps, And in battles of shaking he had fought with it.
\v 33 For, arranged from former time is Tophet, Even it for the king is prepared, He had made deep, He had made large, Its pile is fire and much wood, The breath of Yahweh, As a stream of brim stone, is burning in it!
\c 31
\v 1 Woe to those going down to Egypt for help, And on horses lean, And trust on chariots, because many, And on horsemen, because very strong, And have not looked on the Holy One of Israel, And Yahweh have not sought.
\v 2 And He also is wise, and brought in evil, And His words He had not turned aside, And He had risen against a house of evil doers, And against the help of workers of iniquity.
\v 3 And the Egyptians are men, and not God, And their horses are flesh, and not spirit, And Yahweh stretcheth out His hand, And stumbled had the helper, And fallen had the helped one, And together all of them are consumed.
\v 4 For thus said Yahweh unto me: 'As growl did the lion and the young lion over his prey, Called against whom is a multitude of shepherds, From their voice he is not frightened, And from their noise he is not humbled; So come down did Yahweh of Hosts To war on mount Zion, and on her height.
\v 5 As birds flying, so did Yahweh of Hosts Cover over Jerusalem, covering and delivering, Passing over, and causing to escape.'
\v 6 Turn back to Him from whom sons of Israel Have deepened apostasy.
\v 7 For in that day despise did each His idols of silver, and his idols of gold, That your hands made to you — a sin.
\v 8 And fallen had Asshur by sword, not of the high, Yea, a sword — not of the low, did consume him, And he had fled for himself from the face of a sword, And his young men become tributary.
\v 9 And to his rock from fear he passeth on, And frightened by the ensign have been his princes — an affirmation of Yahweh, Who had a light in Zion, And who had a furnace in Jerusalem!

\v 1 Lo, for righteousness did a king reign, As to princes, for judgment they rule.
\v 2 And each had been as a hiding-place from wind, And as a secret hiding-place from inundation, As rivulets of waters in a dry place, As a shadow of a heavy rock in a weary land.
\v 3 And not dazzled are the eyes of beholders, And the ears of hearers do attend.
\v 4 And the heart of those hastened Understandeth to know, And the tongue of stammerers hasteth to speak clearly.
\v 5 A fool is no more called 'noble,' And to a miser it is not said, 'rich;'
\v 6 For a fool spoke folly, And his heart did iniquity, to do profanity, And to speak concerning Yahweh error, To empty the soul of the hungry, Yea, drink of the thirsty he caused to lack.
\v 7 And the miser — his instruments are evil, He had counselled wicked devices, To corrupt the poor with lying sayings, Even when the needy spoke justly.
\v 8 And the noble counselled noble things, And he for noble things riseth up.
\v 9 Women, easy ones, rise, hear my voice, Daughters, confident ones, give ear to my saying,
\v 10 Days and a year you are troubled, O confident ones, For consumed had been harvest, The gathering came not.
\v 11 Tremble you women, you easy ones, Be troubled, you confident ones, Strip and make bare, with a girdle on the loins,
\v 12 For breasts they are lamenting, For fields of desire, for the fruitful vine.
\v 13 Over the ground of my people thorn — brier went up, Surely over all houses of joy of the exulting city,
\v 14 Surely the palace had been left, The multitude of the city forsaken, Fort and watch-tower had been for dens unto the age, A joy of wild asses — a pasture of herds;
\v 15 Till emptied out on us is the Spirit from on high, And a wilderness had become a fruitful field, And the fruitful field for a forest is reckoned.
\v 16 And dwelt in the wilderness had judgment, And righteousness in the fruitful field remaineth.
\v 17 And a work of the righteousness had been peace, And a service of the righteousness — Keeping quiet and confidence unto the age.
\v 18 And dwelt had My people in a peaceful habitation, And in stedfast tabernacles, And in quiet resting-places.
\v 19 And it had hailed in the going down of the forest, And in the valley is the city low.
\v 20 Happy are you sowing by all waters, Sending forth the foot of the ox and the ass!
\c 33
\v 1 Woe, spoiler! and you not spoiled, And treacherous! and they dealt not treacherously with you, When you will finish, O spoiler, you are spoiled, When you will finish dealing treacherously, They deal treacherously with you.
\v 2 O Yahweh, favour us, for you we have waited, Be their arm, in the mornings, Yea, our salvation in time of adversity.
\v 3 From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples, From yours exaltation scattered have been nations.
\v 4 And gathered had been your spoil, A gathering of the caterpillar, As a running to and fro of locusts is he running on it.
\v 5 Set on high is Yahweh, for He is dwelling on high, He filled Zion with judgment and righteousness,
\v 6 And had been the stedfastness of your times, The strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge, Fear of Yahweh — it is His treasure.
\v 7 Lo, 'Their Ariel,' they have cried without, Messengers of peace do weep bitterly.
\v 8 Desolated have been highways, Ceased had he who passeth along the path, He had broken covenant, He had despised enemies, He had not esteemed a man.
\v 9 Mourned, languished had the land, Confounded had been Lebanon, Withered had been Sharon as a wilderness, And shaking are Bashan and Carmel.
\v 10 Now, do I arise, said Yahweh, Now I am exalted, now I am lifted up.
\v 11 Ye conceive chaff, you bear stubble, Your spirit! — fire devoureth you.
\v 12 And peoples have been as burnings of lime, Thorns, as sweepings, with fire they burn.
\v 13 Hear, you far off, that which I have done, And know, you near ones, My might.
\v 14 Afraid in Zion have been sinners, Seized had trembling the profane: Who did dwell for us — consuming fire, Who did dwell for us — burnings of the age?
\v 15 Whoso is walking righteously, And is speaking uprightly, Kicking against gain of oppressions, Shaking his hands from taking hold on a bribe, Stopping his ear from hearing of blood, And shutting his eyes from looking on evil,
\v 16 He high places did inhabit, Strongholds of rock are his high tower, His bread had been given, his waters stedfast.
\v 17 A king in his beauty, see do yours eyes, They see a land afar off.
\v 18 Your heart did meditate terror, Where is he who is counting? Where is he who is weighing? Where is he who is counting the towers?
\v 19 The strong people you seest not, A people deeper of lip than to be understood, Of a scorned tongue, there is no understanding.
\v 20 See Zion, the city of our meetings, Thine eyes see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, A tent not taken down, Not removed are its pins for ever, And none of its cords are broken.
\v 21 But there mighty is Yahweh for us, A place of rivers — streams broad of sides, No ship with oars did go into it, And a mighty ship did not pass over it.
\v 22 For Yahweh our judge, Yahweh our lawgiver, Yahweh our king — He did save us.
\v 23 Left have been your ropes, They strengthen not rightly their mast, They have not spread out a sail, Then apportioned had been a prey of much spoil, The lame have taken spoil.
\v 24 Nor did an inhabitant say, 'I was sick,' The people that is dwelling in it, is forgiven of iniquity!
\c 34
\v 1 Come near, you nations, to hear, And you peoples, give attention, Hear did the earth and its fulness, The world, and all its productions.
\v 2 For wrath is to Yahweh against all the nations, And fury against all their host, He had devoted them to destruction, He had given them to slaughter.
\v 3 And their wounded are cast out, And their carcases cause their stench to ascend, And melted have been mountains from their blood.
\v 4 And consumed have been all the host of the heavens, And rolled together as a book have been the heavens, And all their hosts do fade, As the fading of a leaf of a vine, And as the fading one of a fig-tree.
\v 5 For soaked in the heavens was My sword, Lo, on Edom it came down, On the people of My curse for judgment.
\v 6 A sword is to Yahweh — it had been full of blood, It had been made fat with fatness, With blood of lambs and he-goats. With fat of kidneys of rams, For a sacrifice is to Yahweh in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
\v 7 And come down have reems with them, And bullocks with bulls, And soaked had been their land from blood, And their dust from fatness is made fat.
\v 8 (For a day of vengeance is to Yahweh, A year of recompences for Zion's strife,)
\v 9 And turned have been her streams to pitch, And her dust to brimstone, And her land had become burning pitch.
\v 10 By night and by day she is not quenched, To the age go up did her smoke, From generation to generation she is waste, For ever and ever, none is passing into her.
\v 11 And possess her do pelican and hedge-hog, And owl and raven dwell in her, And He had stretched out over her A line of vacancy, and stones of emptiness.
\v 12 To the kingdom her freemen they call, But there are none there, And all her princes are at an end.
\v 13 And gone up her palaces have thorns, Nettle and bramble are in her fortresses, And it had been a habitation of dragons, A court for daughters of an ostrich.
\v 14 And met have Ziim with Aiim, And the goat for its companion called, Only there rested had the night-owl, And had found for herself a place of rest.
\v 15 There made her nest had the bittern, Yea, she laid, and had hatched, And had gathered under her shadow, Only there gathered have been vultures, Each with its companion.
\v 16 Seek out of the book of Yahweh, and read, One of these had not been lacking, None had missed its companion, For My mouth — it had commanded, And His spirit — He had gathered them.
\v 17 And He had cast for them a lot, And His hand had apportioned it to them by line, Unto the age they possess it, To all generations they dwell in it!
\c 35
\v 1 They joy from the wilderness and dry place, And rejoice did the desert, and flourish as the rose,
\v 2 Flourishing it did flourish, and rejoice, Yea, with joy and singing, The honour of Lebanon had been given to it, The beauty of Carmel and Sharon, They — they see the honour of Yahweh, The majesty of our God.
\v 3 Strengthen you the feeble hands, Yea, the stumbling knees strengthen.
\v 4 Say to the hastened of heart, 'Be strong, Fear not, behold, your God; vengeance came, The recompence of God, He Himself did come and save you.'
\v 5 Then opened are eyes of the blind, And ears of the deaf are unstopped,
\v 6 Then leap as a hart did the lame, And sing did the tongue of the dumb, For broken up in a wilderness have been waters, And streams in a desert.
\v 7 And the mirage had become a pond, And the thirsty land fountains of waters, In the habitation of dragons, Its place of couching down, a court for reed and rush.
\v 8 And a highway had been there, and a way, And the 'way of holiness' is called to it, Not pass over it did the unclean, And He Himself is by them, Whoso is going in the way — even fools err not.
\v 9 No lion is there, yea, a destructive beast Ascendeth it not, it is not found there, And walked have the redeemed,
\v 10 And the ransomed of Yahweh return, And have entered Zion with singing. And joy age-during on their head, Joy and gladness they attain, And fled away have sorrow and sighing!
\c 36
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, come up had Sennacherib king of Asshur against all the fenced cities of Judah, and seizeth them.
\v 2 And the king of Asshur sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, unto the king Hezekiah, with a heavy force, and he standeth by the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field,
\v 3 and go forth unto him did Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who is over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the remembrancer.
\v 4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, 'Say you, I pray you, unto Hezekiah, 'Thus said the great king, the king of Asshur, What is this confidence in which you hast confided?
\v 5 I have said: Only, a word of the lips! counsel and might are for battle: now, on whom hast you trusted, that you hast rebelled against me?
\v 6 Lo, you hast trusted on the staff of this broken reed — on Egypt — which a man leaneth on, and it had gone into his hand, and pierced it — so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all those trusting on him.
\v 7 'And will you say unto me, Unto Yahweh our God we have trusted? is it not He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah had turned aside, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar you do bow yourselves?
\v 8 'And now, negotiate, I pray you, with my lord the king of Asshur, and I give to you two thousand horses, if you are able to put for you riders on them.
\v 9 And how will you turn back the face of one captain of the least of the servants of my lord, and will trust for you on Egypt, for chariot and for horsemen?
\v 10 And now, without Yahweh have I come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said unto me, Go up unto this land, and you hast destroyed it.'
\v 11 And Eliakim said — and Shebna and Joah — unto Rabshakeh, 'Speak, we pray you, unto your servants in Aramaean, for we are understanding; and do not speak unto us in Jewish, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.'
\v 12 And Rabshakeh said, 'Unto your lord, and unto you, had my lord sent me to speak these words? is it not for the men — those sitting on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you?'
\v 13 And Rabshakeh standeth and called with a great voice in Jewish, and said, 'Hear you the words of the great king, the king of Asshur:
\v 14 Thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah lift you up, for he is not able to deliver you;
\v 15 and let not Hezekiah make you trust unto Yahweh, saying, Yahweh did certainly deliver us, this city is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.
\v 16 'Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for thus said the king of Asshur, Make you with me a blessing, and come out unto me, and eat you each of his vine, and each of his fig-tree, and drink you each the waters of his own well,
\v 17 till my coming in, and I have taken you unto a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards;
\v 18 lest Hezekiah did persuade you, saying, Yahweh did deliver us. 'Have the gods of the nations delivered each his land out of the hand of the king of Asshur?
\v 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where the gods of Sepharvaim, that they have delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\v 20 Who among all the gods of these lands are they who have delivered their land out of my hand, that Yahweh did deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'
\v 21 And they keep silent, and have not answered him a word, for a command of the king is, saying, 'Do not answer him.'
\v 22 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who is over the house, came in, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the remembrancer, unto Hezekiah with rent garments, and they declare to him the words of Rabshakeh.
\c 37
\v 1 And it came to pass, at the king Hezekiah's hearing, that he rendeth his garments, and covereth himself with sackcloth, and entereth the house of Yahweh,
\v 2 and sent Eliakim, who is over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covering themselves with sackcloth, unto Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet,
\v 3 and they say unto him, 'Thus said Hezekiah, A day of distress, and rebuke, and despising, is this day; for come have sons unto the birth, and power there is not to bear.
\v 4 'It may be Yahweh your God did hear the words of Rabshakeh with which the king of Asshur his lord had sent him to reproach the living God, and had decided concerning the words that Yahweh your God had heard, and you hast lifted up prayer for the remnant that is found.'
\v 5 And the servants of king Hezekiah come in unto Isaiah,
\v 6 and Isaiah said unto them, 'Thus do you say unto your lord, Thus said Yahweh, Be not afraid because of the words that you hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have reviled Me.
\v 7 Lo, I am giving in him a spirit, and he had heard a report, and had turned back unto his land, and I have caused him to fall by the sword in his land.'
\v 8 And Rabshakeh turneth back and finds the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had journeyed from Lachish.
\v 9 And he heareth concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, 'He had come out to fight with you;' and he heareth, and sent messengers unto Hezekiah, saying,
\v 10 'Thus do you speak unto Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God lift you up in whom you are trusting, saying, Jerusalem is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur.
\v 11 Lo, you hast heard that which the kings of Asshur have done to all the lands — to devote them — and you are delivered!
\v 12 Did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed — Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who are in Telassar?
\v 13 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'
\v 14 And Hezekiah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers, and readeth them, and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spreadeth it before Yahweh.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayeth unto Yahweh, saying,
\v 16 Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubs, You are God Himself — Yourself alone — to all kingdoms of the earth, You hast made the heavens and the earth.
\v 17 Incline, O Yahweh, Thine ear, and hear; open, O Yahweh, Thine eyes and see; and hear You all the words of Sennacherib that he had sent to reproach the living God.
\v 18 'Truly, O Yahweh, kings of Asshur have laid waste all the lands and their land,
\v 19 so as to put their gods into fire — for they are no gods, but work of the hands of man, wood and stone — and they destroy them.
\v 20 And now, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand, and all kingdoms of the earth do know that You are Yahweh, Yourself alone.'
\v 21 And Isaiah son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, That which you hast prayed unto me concerning Sennacherib king of Asshur — 
\v 22 this is the word that Yahweh spake concerning him: Trampled on you, laughed at you, Hath the virgin daughter of Zion, Behind you shaken the head had the daughter of Jerusalem.
\v 23 Whom hast you reproached and reviled? And against whom lifted up the voice? Yea, you will lift up on high yours eyes Against the Holy One of Israel.
\v 24 By the hand of your servants You hast reviled the Lord, and sayest: In the multitude of my chariots I have come up to a high place of hills, The sides of Lebanon, And I cut down the height of its cedars, The choice of its firs, And I enter the high place of its extremity, The forest of its Carmel.
\v 25 I — I have dug and drunk waters, And I dry up with the sole of my steps All floods of a bulwark.
\v 26 Hast you not heard from afar? — it I did, From days of old — that I formed it. Now, I have brought it in, And it is to make desolate, Ruinous heaps — fenced cities,
\v 27 And their inhabitants are feeble-handed, They were broken down, and are dried up. They have been the herb of the field, And the greenness of the tender grass, Grass of the roofs, And blasted corn, before it had risen up.
\v 28 And your sitting down, and your going out, And your coming in, I have known, And your anger towards Me.
\v 29 Because of your anger towards Me, And your noise — it came up into Mine ears, I have put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And I have caused you to turn back In the way in which you camest.
\v 30  — And this to you is the sign, Food of the year is self-sown grain, And in the second year the spontaneous growth, And in the third year, sow you and reap, And plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
\v 31 And it had continued — the escaped Of the house of Judah that had been left — To take root beneath, And it had made fruit upward.
\v 32 For from Jerusalem went forth a remnant, And an escape from mount Zion, The zeal of Yahweh of Hosts did this.
\v 33 Therefore, thus said Yahweh, Concerning the king of Asshur: He did not come in unto this city, Nor did he shoot there an arrow, Nor did he come before it with shield, Nor did he pour out against it a mount.
\v 34 In the way that he came, in it he turneth back, And unto this city he did not come in, An affirmation of Yahweh,
\v 35 And I have covered over this city, To save it, for Mine own sake, And for the sake of David My servant.'
\v 36 And a messenger of Yahweh went out, and smiteth in the camp of Asshur a hundred and eighty and five thousand; and men rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them are dead corpses.
\v 37 And journey, and go, and turn back did Sennacherib king of Asshur, and dwelleth in Nineveh.
\v 38 And it came to pass, he is bowing himself in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons have smitten him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land of Ararat, and Esar-Haddon his son reigneth in his stead.
\c 38
\v 1 In those days had Hezekiah been sick unto death, and come in unto him did Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, and said unto him, 'Thus said Yahweh: Give a charge to your house, for you are dying, and will not live.'
\v 2 And Hezekiah turneth round his face unto the wall, and prayeth unto Yahweh,
\v 3 and said, 'I pray you, O Yahweh, remember, I pray Thee, how I have walked habitually before Thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and that which is good in yours eyes I have done;' and Hezekiah weepeth — a great weeping.
\v 4 And a word of Yahweh is unto Isaiah, saying,
\v 5 Go, and you hast said to Hezekiah, Thus said Yahweh, God of David your father, 'I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tear, behold, I am adding to your days fifteen years,
\v 6 and out of the hand of the king of Asshur I deliver you and this city, and have covered over this city.
\v 7 And this is to you the sign from Yahweh, that Yahweh did this thing that He had spoken.
\v 8 Lo, I am bringing back the shadow of the degrees that it had gone down on the degrees of Ahaz, by the sun, backward ten degrees:' and the sun turneth back ten degrees in the degrees that it had gone down.
\v 9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah concerning his being sick, when he reviveth from his sickness:
\v 10 I — I said in the cutting off of my days, I go in to the gates of Sheol, I have numbered the remnant of mine years.
\v 11 I said, I do not see Jah — Jah! In the land of the living, I do not behold man any more, With the inhabitants of the world.
\v 12 My sojourning had departed, And been removed from me as a shepherd's tent, I have drawn together, as a weaver, my life, By weakness it cutteth me off, From day unto night You will end me.
\v 13 I have set Him till morning as a lion, So did He break all my bones, From day unto night You will end me.
\v 14 As a crane — a swallow — so I chatter, I mourn as a dove, Drawn up have been mine eyes on high, O Yahweh, oppression is on me, be my surety.
\v 15  — What do I say? seeing He said to me, And He Himself had wrought, I go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul.
\v 16 Lord, by these do men live, And by all in them is the life of my spirit, And You savest me, make me also to live,
\v 17 Lo, to peace He changed for me bitterness, And You hast delighted in my soul without corruption, For You hast cast behind Your back all my sins.
\v 18 For Sheol did not confess Thee, Death did not praise Thee, Those going down to the pit hope not for Your truth.
\v 19 The living, the living, he did confess Thee.
\v 20 Like myself to-day — a father to sons Doth make known of Your faithfulness, O Yahweh — to save me: And my songs we sing all days of our lives In the house of Yahweh.'
\v 21 And Isaiah said, 'Let them take a bunch of figs, and plaster over the ulcer, and he lived.'
\v 22 And Hezekiah said, 'What is the sign that I go up to the house of Yahweh!'
\c 39
\v 1 At that time had Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah, when he heareth that he had been sick, and is become strong.
\v 2 And Hezekiah rejoiceth over them, and sheweth them the house of his spices, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good ointment, and all the house of his vessels, and all that had been found in his treasures; there had not been a thing in his house, and in all his dominion, that Hezekiah had not showed them.
\v 3 And Isaiah the prophet came in unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, 'What said these men? and whence come they unto you?' And Hezekiah said, 'From a land afar off they have come unto me — from Babylon.'
\v 4 And he said, 'What saw they in your house?' and Hezekiah said, 'All that is in my house they saw; there had not been a thing that I have not showed them among my treasures.'
\v 5 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, 'Hear a word of Yahweh of Hosts:
\v 6 Lo, days are coming, and borne had been all that is in your house, and that your fathers have treasured up till this day, to Babylon; there is not left a thing, said Yahweh;
\v 7 and of your sons who come forth from you, whom you begettest, they take, and they have been eunuchs in a palace of the king of Babylon.'
\v 8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, 'Good is the word of Yahweh that you hast spoken;' and he said, 'Because there is peace and truth in my days.'
\c 40
\v 1 Comfort you, comfort you, My people, said your God.
\v 2 Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her, That her warfare had been completed, That accepted had been her punishment, That she had received from the hand of Yahweh Double for all her sins.
\v 3 A voice is crying — in a wilderness — Prepare you the way of Yahweh, Make straight in a desert a highway to our God.
\v 4 Every valley is raised up, And every mountain and hill become low, And the crooked place had become a plain, And the entangled places a valley.
\v 5 And revealed had been the honour of Yahweh, And seen it have all flesh together, For the mouth of Yahweh had spoken.
\v 6 A voice is saying, 'Call,' And he said, 'What do I call?' All flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is As a flower of the field:
\v 7 Withered had grass, faded the flower, For the Spirit of Yahweh blew upon it, Surely the people is grass;
\v 8 Withered had grass, faded the flower, But a word of our God riseth for ever.
\v 9 On a high mountain get you up, O Zion, Proclaiming tidings, Lift up with power your voice, O Jerusalem, proclaiming tidings, Lift up, fear not, say to cities of Judah, 'Lo, your God.'
\v 10 Lo, the Lord Yahweh with strength came, And His arm is ruling for Him, Lo, His hire is with Him, and His wage before Him.
\v 11 As a shepherd His flock He feedeth, With His arm He gathereth lambs, And in His bosom He carrieth them: Suckling ones He leadeth.
\v 12 Who had measured in the hollow of his hand the waters? And the heavens by a span had meted out, And comprehended in a measure the dust of the earth, And had weighed in scales the mountains, And the hills in a balance?
\v 13 Who had meted out the Spirit of Yahweh, And, being His counsellor, did teach Him!
\v 14 With whom consulted He, That he caused Him to understand? And teacheth Him in the path of judgment, And teacheth Him knowledge? And the way of understanding caused Him to know?
\v 15 Lo, nations as a drop from a bucket, And as small dust of the balance, have been reckoned, Lo, isles as a small thing He took up.
\v 16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, Nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering.
\v 17 All the nations are as nothing before Him, Less than nothing and emptiness, They have been reckoned to Him.
\v 18 And unto whom do you liken God, And what likeness do you compare to Him?
\v 19 The graven image poured out had a artisan, And a refiner with gold spreadeth it over, And chains of silver he is refining.
\v 20 He who is poor by heave-offerings, A tree not rotten did choose, A skilful artisan he seeketh for it, To establish a graven image — not moved.
\v 21 Do you not know — do you not hear? Hath it not been declared from the first to you? Have you not understood From the foundations of the earth?
\v 22 He who is sitting on the circle of the earth, And its inhabitants are as grasshoppers, He who is stretching out as a thin thing the heavens, And spreadeth them as a tent to dwell in.
\v 23 He who is making princes become nothing, Judges of earth as emptiness had made;
\v 24 Yea, they have not been planted, Yea, they have not been sown, Yea, not taking root in the earth is their stock, And also He had blown upon them, and they wither, And a whirlwind as stubble took them away.
\v 25 And unto whom do you liken Me, And am I equal? said the Holy One.
\v 26 Lift up on high your eyes, And see — who had prepared these? He who is bringing out by number their host, To all of them by name He called, By abundance of strength (And he is strong in power) not one is lacking.
\v 27 Why sayest you, O Jacob? and speakest you, O Israel? 'My way had been hid from Yahweh, And from my God my judgment passeth over.'
\v 28 Hast you not known? hast you not heard? The God of the age — Yahweh, Preparer of the ends of the earth, Is not wearied nor fatigued, There is no searching of His understanding.
\v 29 He is giving power to the weary, And to those not strong He increaseth might.
\v 30 Even youths are wearied and fatigued, And young men utterly stumble,
\v 31 But those expecting Yahweh pass to power, They raise up the pinion as eagles, They run and are not fatigued, They go on and do not faint!
\c 41
\v 1 Keep silent towards Me, O isles, And the peoples pass on to power, They come nigh, then they speak, 'Together — to judgment we draw near.'
\v 2 Who stirred up from the east a righteous one? He called him to His foot, He gave before him nations, And kings He caused him to rule, He gave them as dust to his sword, As driven stubble to his bow.
\v 3 He pursueth them, he passeth over in safety A path with his feet he entereth not.
\v 4 Who had wrought and done, Calling the generations from the first? I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last I am He.
\v 5 Seen have isles and fear, ends of the earth tremble, They have drawn near, yea, they come.
\v 6 Each his neighbour they help, And to his brother he said, 'Be strong.'
\v 7 And strengthen did an artisan the refiner, A smoother with a hammer, Him who is beating on an anvil, Saying, 'For joining it is good,' And he strengtheneth it with nails, it is not moved!
\v 8  — And you, O Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, Seed of Abraham, My lover,
\v 9 Whom I have taken hold of, from the ends of the earth, And from its near places I have called you, And I say to you, My servant You are, I have chosen you, and not rejected you.
\v 10 Be not afraid, for with you I am, Look not around, for I am your God, I have strengthened you, Yea, I have helped you, yea, I upheld you, With the right hand of My righteousness.
\v 11 Lo, all those displeased with you, They are ashamed and blush, They are as nothing, yea, perish Do the men who strive with you.
\v 12 You seekest them, and findest them not, The men who debate with you, They are as nothing, yea, as nothing, The men who war with you.
\v 13 For I, Yahweh your God, Am strengthening your right hand, He who is saying to you, 'Fear not, I have helped you.'
\v 14 Fear not, O worm Jacob, you men of Israel, I helped you, an affirmation of Yahweh, Even your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
\v 15 Lo, I have set you for a new sharp threshing instrument, Possessing teeth, you threshest mountains, And beatest small, and hills as chaff you makest.
\v 16 You winnowest them, and a wind lifteth them up, And a whirlwind scattereth them, And you — you rejoicest in Yahweh, In the Holy One of Israel will boast thyself.
\v 17 The poor and the needy are seeking water, And there is none, Their tongue with thirst had failed, I, Yahweh do answer them, The God of Israel — I forsake them not.
\v 18 I open on high places rivers, And in middle of valleys fountains, I make a wilderness become a pond of water, And a dry land become springs of water.
\v 19 I give in a wilderness the cedar, Shittah, and myrtle, and oil-tree, I set in a desert the fir-pine and box-wood together.
\v 20 So that they see, and know, And regard, and act wisely together, For the hand of Yahweh had done this, And the Holy One of Israel had prepared it.
\v 21 Bring near your cause, said Yahweh, Bring nigh your mighty ones, said the king of Jacob.
\v 22 They bring nigh, and declare to us that which did happen, The first things — what they are declare you, And we set our heart, and know their latter end, Or the coming things cause us to hear.
\v 23 Declare the things that are coming hereafter, And we know that you are gods, Yea, you may do good or do evil, And we look around and see it together.
\v 24 Lo, you are of nothing, and your work of nought, An abomination — it fixeth on you.
\v 25 I have stirred up one from the north, And he came, From the rising of the sun he called in My name, And he came in on prefects as on clay, And as a potter treadeth down mire.
\v 26 Who had declared from the first, and we know? And beforetime, and we say, 'Righteous?' yea, there is none declaring, Yea, there is none proclaiming, Yea, there is none hearing your sayings.
\v 27 First to Zion, Behold, behold them, And to Jerusalem one proclaiming tidings I give,
\v 28 And I see that there is no man, Yea, of these that there is no counsellor, And I ask them, and they return word:
\v 29 Lo, all of them are vanity, Nought are their works, Wind and emptiness their molten images!'
\c 42
\v 1 Lo, My servant, I take hold on him, My chosen one — My soul had accepted, I have put My Spirit upon him, Judgment to nations he brought forth.
\v 2 He did not cry, nor lift up, Nor cause his voice to be heard, in the street.
\v 3 A bruised reed he breaketh not, And dim flax he quencheth not, To truth he brought forth judgment.
\v 4 He did not become weak nor bruised, Till he setteth judgment in the earth, And for his law isles wait with hope.
\v 5 Thus said God, Yahweh, preparing The heavens, and stretching them out, Spreading out the earth and its productions, Giving breath to the people on it, And spirit to those walking in it.
\v 6 I, Yahweh, did call you in righteousness, And I lay hold on your hand, and keep you, And I give you for a covenant of a people, And a light of nations.
\v 7 To open the eyes of the blind, To bring forth from prison the bound one, From the house of restraint those sitting in darkness.
\v 8 I am Yahweh, this is My name, And Mine honour to another I give not, Nor My praise to graven images.
\v 9 The former things, behold, have come, And new things I am declaring, Before they spring up I cause you to hear.
\v 10 Sing to Yahweh a new song, His praise from the end of the earth, Ye who are going down to the sea, and its fulness, Isles, and their inhabitants.
\v 11 The wilderness and its cities do lift up the voice, The villages Kedar did inhabit, Sing do the inhabitants of Sela, From the top of mountains they cry.
\v 12 They ascribe to Yahweh honour, And His praise in the isles they declare.
\v 13 Yahweh as a mighty one went forth. As a man of war He stirreth up zeal, He crieth, yea, He shrieketh, Against His enemies He showeth Himself mighty.
\v 14 I have kept silent from of old, I keep silent, I refrain myself, As a travailing woman I cry out, I desolate and swallow up together.
\v 15 I make waste mountains and hills, And all their herbs I dry up, And I have made rivers become isles, And ponds I dry up.
\v 16 And I have caused the blind to go, In a way they have not known, In paths they have not known I cause them to tread, I make a dark place before them become light, And unlevelled places become a plain, These are the things I have done to them, And I have not forsaken them.
\v 17 Removed backward — utterly ashamed, Are those trusting in a graven image, Those saying to a molten image, 'Ye are our gods.'
\v 18 Ye deaf, hear; and you blind, look to see.
\v 19 Who is blind but My servant? And deaf as My messenger I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace, Yea, blind, as the servant of Yahweh?
\v 20 Seeing many things, and you observest not, Opening ears, and he heareth not.
\v 21 Yahweh had delight for the sake of His righteousness, He magnifieth law, and made honourable.
\v 22 And this is a people seized and spoiled, Snared in holes — all of them, And in houses of restraint they were hidden, They have been for a prey, And there is no deliverer, A spoil, and none is saying, 'Restore.'
\v 23 Who among you gave ear to this? Attendeth, and heareth afterwards.
\v 24 Who had given Jacob for a spoil, And Israel to the spoilers? Is it not Yahweh — He against whom we sinned? Yea, they have not been willing in His ways to walk, Nor have they hearkened to His law.
\v 25 And He poureth on him fury, His anger, and the strength of battle, And it setteth him on fire round about, And he had not known, And it burneth against him, and he laid it not to heart!
\c 43
\v 1 And now, thus said Yahweh, Your Creator, O Jacob, and your Fashioner, O Israel, Be not afraid, for I have redeemed you, I have called on your name — you are Mine.
\v 2 When you passest into waters, I am with you, And into floods, they do not overflow you, When you goest into fire, you are not burnt, And a flame did not burn against you.
\v 3 For I — Yahweh your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Saviour, I have appointed Egypt yours atonement, Cush and Seba in your stead.
\v 4 Since you wast precious in Mine eyes, You wast honoured, and I have loved you, And I appoint men in your stead, And peoples instead of your life.
\v 5 Be not afraid, for I am with you, From the east I bring in your seed, And from the west I gather you.
\v 6 I am saying to the north, 'Give up,' And to the south, 'Restrain not.' Bring in My sons from afar, And My daughters from the end of the earth.
\v 7 Every one who is called by My name, Even for My honour I have created him, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.
\v 8 He brought out a blind people who have eyes, And deaf ones who have ears.
\v 9 All the nations have been gathered together, And the peoples are assembled, Who among them declareth this, And former things caused us to hear? They give their witnesses, And they are declared righteous, And they hear and say, 'Truth.'
\v 10 Ye are My witnesses, an affirmation of Yahweh, And My servant whom I have chosen, So that you know and give credence to Me, And understand that I am He, Before Me there was no God formed, And after Me there is none.
\v 11 I — I am Yahweh, And besides Me there is no saviour.
\v 12 I — I declared, and saved, and proclaimed, And there is no stranger with you, And you are My witnesses, an affirmation of Yahweh, And I am God.
\v 13 Even from the day I am He, And there is no deliverer from My hand, I work, and who did turn it back?
\v 14 Thus said Yahweh, your Redeemer, The Holy One of Israel: 'For your sake I have sent to Babylon, And caused bars to descend — all of them, And the Chaldeans, whose song is in the ships.
\v 15 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, Creator of Israel, your King.'
\v 16 Thus said Yahweh, Who is giving in the sea a way, And in the strong waters a path.
\v 17 Who is bringing forth chariot and horse, A force, even a strong one: 'Together they lie down — they rise not, They have been extinguished, As flax they have been quenched.'
\v 18 Remember not former things, And ancient things consider not.
\v 19 Lo, I am doing a new thing, now it springeth up, Do you not know it? Yea, I put in a wilderness a way, In a desolate place — floods.
\v 20 Honour me did the beast of the field, Dragons and daughters of an ostrich, For I have given in a wilderness waters, Floods in a desolate place, To give drink to My people — My chosen.
\v 21 This people I have formed for Myself, My praise they recount.
\v 22 And Me you hast not called, O Jacob, For you hast been wearied of me, O Israel,
\v 23 You hast not brought in to Me, The lamb of your burnt-offerings, And with your sacrifices you hast not honoured Me, I have not caused you to serve with a present, Nor wearied you with frankincense.
\v 24 You hast not bought for Me with money sweet cane, And with the fat of your sacrifices hast not filled Me, Only — you hast caused Me to serve with your sins, You hast wearied Me with yours iniquities.
\v 25 I — I am He who is blotting out Your transgressions for Mine own sake, And your sins I do not remember.
\v 26 Cause me to remember — we are judged together, Declare you that you may be justified.
\v 27 Your first father sinned, And yours interpreters transgressed against me,
\v 28 And I pollute princes of the sanctuary, And I give Jacob to destruction, and Israel to revilings!
\c 44
\v 1 And now, hear, O Jacob, My servant, And Israel, whom I have fixed on:
\v 2 Thus said Yahweh, your Maker, and your Former, From the womb He did help you; Fear not, my servant Jacob, And Jeshurun, whom I have fixed on.
\v 3 For I pour waters on a thirsty one, And floods on a dry land, I pour My Spirit on your seed, And My blessing on yours offspring.
\v 4 And they have sprung up as among grass, As willows by streams of water.
\v 5 This one said, For Yahweh I am, And this called himself by the name of Jacob, And this one writeth with his hand, 'For Yahweh,' and by the name of Israel surnameth himself.
\v 6 Thus said Yahweh, king of Israel, And his Redeemer, Yahweh of Hosts: 'I am the first, and I the last, And besides Me there is no God.
\v 7 And who as I, did call and declare it, And arrange it for Me, Since My placing the people of antiquity, And things that are coming, And those that do come, declare they to them?
\v 8 Fear not, nor be afraid, Have I not from that time caused you to hear, and declared? And you are My witnesses, Is there a God besides Me? yea, there is none, A Rock I have not known.
\v 9 Framers of a graven image are all of them emptiness, And their desirable things do not profit, And their own witnesses they are, They see not, nor know, that they may be ashamed.
\v 10 Who had formed a god, And a molten image poured out — not profitable?
\v 11 Lo, all his companions are ashamed, As to artisans — they are of men, All of them gather together, they stand up, They fear, they are ashamed together.
\v 12 He had wrought iron with an axe, And had wrought with coals, And with hammers did form it, And did work it by his powerful arm, Yea, he is hungry, and there is no power, He did not drink water, and he is wearied.
\v 13 He had wrought with wood, He had stretched out a rule, He did mark it out with a line, He made it with carving tools, And with a compass he marketh it out, And made it according to the form of a man, According to the beauty of a man, To remain in the house.
\v 14 Cutting down to himself cedars, He took also a cypress, and an oak, And he strengtheneth it for himself Among the trees of a forest, He had planted an ash, and the shower did nourish it.
\v 15 And it had been for man to burn, And he took of them, and became warm, Yea, he kindleth it, and had baked bread, Yea, he made a god, and boweth himself, He had made it a graven image, And he falleth down to it.
\v 16 Half of it he had burnt in the fire, By this half of it he eateth flesh, He roasteth a roasting, and is satisfied, Yea, he is warm, and said: 'Aha, I have become warm, I have enjoyed the light.
\v 17 And its remnant for a god he had made — For his graven image, He falleth down to it, and worshippeth, And prayeth unto it, and he said, 'Deliver me, for my god you are.'
\v 18 They have not known, nor do they understand, For He had daubed their eyes from seeing, Their heart from acting wisely.
\v 19 And none did turn it back unto his heart, Nor had knowledge nor understanding to say, 'Half of it I have burned in the fire, Yea, also, I have baked bread over its coals, I roast flesh and I eat, And its remnant for an abomination I make, To the stock of a tree I fall down.'
\v 20 Feeding on ashes, the heart is deceived, It had turned him aside, And he delivereth not his soul, nor said: 'Is there not a lie in my right hand?'
\v 21 Remember these, O Jacob, and Israel, For My servant you are, I formed you, a servant to Me you are, O Israel, you will not forget Me.
\v 22 I have blotted out, as by a thick cloud, Your transgressions, And as by a cloud your sins, Return unto Me, for I have redeemed you.
\v 23 Sing, O heavens, for Yahweh had wrought, Shout, O lower parts of earth, Break forth, O mountains, with singing, Forest, and every tree in it, For Yahweh had redeemed Jacob, And in Israel He did beautify Himself.
\v 24 Thus said Yahweh, your redeemer, And your framer from the womb: 'I am Yahweh, doing all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself, Spreading out the earth — who is with Me?
\v 25 Making void the tokens of devisers, And diviners it made mad, Turning the wise backward, And their knowledge it made foolish.
\v 26 Confirming the word of His servant, The counsel of His messengers it perfecteth, Who is saying of Jerusalem, She is inhabited, And of cities of Judah, They shall be built, and her wastes I raise up,
\v 27 Who is saying to the deep, Be dry, and your rivers I cause to dry up,
\v 28 Who is saying of Cyrus, My shepherd, And all my delight He did perfect, So as to say of Jerusalem, You are built, And of the temple, You are founded.
\c 45
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh, To His anointed, to Cyrus, Whose right hand I have laid hold on, To subdue nations before him, Yea, loins of kings I loose, To open before him two-leaved doors, Yea, gates are not shut:
\v 2 'I go before you, and crooked places make straight, Two-leaved doors of brass I shiver, And bars of iron I cut asunder,
\v 3 And have given to you treasures of darkness, Even treasures of secret places, So that you knowest that I, Yahweh, Who am calling on your name — am the God of Israel.
\v 4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, And of Israel My chosen, I call also you by your name, I surname you, And you hast not known Me.
\v 5 I am Yahweh, and there is none else, Except Me there is no God, I gird you, and you hast not known Me.
\v 6 So that they know from the rising of the sun, And from the west, that there is none besides Me, I am Yahweh, and there is none else,
\v 7 Forming light, and preparing darkness, Making peace, and preparing evil, I am Yahweh, doing all these things.'
\v 8 Drop, you heavens, from above, And clouds do cause righteousness to flow, Earth opened, and they are fruitful, Salvation and righteousness spring up together, I, Yahweh, have prepared it.
\v 9 Woe to him who is striving with his Former, (A potsherd with potsherds of the ground!) Doth clay say to its Framer, 'What will you?' And your work, 'He had no hands?'
\v 10 Woe to him who is saying to a father, 'What will you beget?' Or to a wife, 'What will you bring forth?
\v 11 Thus said Yahweh, The Holy One of Israel, and his Former: Ask Me of the things coming concerning My sons, Yea, concerning the work of My hands, you command Me.'
\v 12 I made earth, and man on it prepared, I — My hands stretched out the heavens, And all their host I have commanded.
\v 13 I have stirred him up in righteousness, And all his ways I make straight, He did build My city, and My captivity did send out, Not for price, nor for bribe, said Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 14 Thus said Yahweh, 'The labour of Egypt, And the merchandise of Cush, And of the Sebaim — men of measure, Unto you pass over, and yours they are, After you they go, in fetters they pass over, And unto you they bow themselves, Unto you they pray: Only in you is God, And there is none else, no other God.
\v 15 Surely You are a God hiding Yourself, God of Israel — Saviour!
\v 16 They have been ashamed, And they have even blushed — all of them, Together gone in confusion have those carving images.
\v 17 Israel had been saved in Yahweh, A salvation age-during! Ye are not ashamed nor confounded Unto the ages of eternity!
\v 18 For thus said Yahweh, Creator of heaven, He is God, Former of earth, and its Maker, He established it — not empty He prepared it, For inhabiting He formed it: 'I am Yahweh, and there is none else.
\v 19 Not in secret have I spoken, in a dark place of the earth, I have not said to the seed of Jacob, In vain seek you Me, I am Yahweh, speaking righteousness, Declaring uprightness.
\v 20 Be gathered, and come in, Come nigh together, you escaped of the nations, They have not known, Who are lifting up the wood of their graven image, And praying unto a god that saveth not.
\v 21 Declare you, and bring near, Yea, they take counsel together, Who had proclaimed this from of old? From that time had declared it? Is it not I — Yahweh? And there is no other god besides Me, A God righteous and saving, there is none save Me.
\v 22 Turn to Me, and be saved, all ends of the earth, For I am God, and there is none else.
\v 23 By Myself I have sworn, Gone out from my mouth in righteousness had a word, And it turneth not back, That to Me, bow did every knee, every tongue swear.
\v 24 Only in Yahweh, said had one, Have I righteousness and strength, Unto Him he came in, And ashamed are all those displeased with Him.
\v 25 In Yahweh are all the seed of Israel justified, And they boast themselves.'
\c 46
\v 1 Bowed down had Bel, stooping is Nebo, Their idols have been for the beast and for cattle, Your burdens are loaded, a burden to the weary.
\v 2 They have stooped, they have bowed together, They have not been able to deliver the burden, And themselves into captivity have gone.
\v 3 Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of Israel, Who are borne from the belly, Who are carried from the womb,
\v 4 Even to old age I am He, and to grey hairs I carry, I made, and I bear, yea, I carry and deliver.
\v 5 To whom do you liken Me, and make equal? And compare Me, that we may be like?
\v 6  — They are pouring out gold from a bag, And silver on the beam they weigh, They hire a refiner, and he made it a god, They fall down, yea, they bow themselves.
\v 7 They lift him up on the shoulder, They carry him, and cause him to rest in his place, And he standeth, from his place he moveth not, Yea, one crieth unto him, and he answereth not, From his adversity he saveth him not.
\v 8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men, Turn it back, O transgressors, to the heart.
\v 9 Remember former things of old, For I am Mighty, and there is none else, God — and there is none like Me.
\v 10 Declaring from the beginning the latter end, And from of old that which had not been done, Saying, 'My counsel did stand, And all My delight I do.'
\v 11 Calling from the east a ravenous bird, From a far land the man of My counsel, Yea, I have spoken, yea, I bring it in, I have formed it, yea, I do it.
\v 12 Hearken unto Me, you mighty in heart, Who are far from righteousness.
\v 13 I have brought near My righteousness, It is not far off, And My salvation — it did not tarry, And I have given in Zion salvation, To Israel My glory!
\c 47
\v 1 Come down, and sit on the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, Sit on the earth, there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans, For no more do they cry to you, 'O tender and delicate one.'
\v 2 Take millstones, and grind flour, Remove your veil, draw up the skirt, Uncover the leg, pass over the floods.
\v 3 Revealed is your nakedness, yea, seen is your reproach, Vengeance I take, and I meet not a man.
\v 4 Our redeemer is Yahweh of Hosts, His name is the Holy One of Israel.
\v 5 Sit silent, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, For no more do they cry to you, 'Mistress of kingdoms.'
\v 6 I have been wroth against My people, I have polluted Mine inheritance And I give them into your hand, You hast not appointed for them mercies, On the aged you hast made your yoke very heavy,
\v 7 And you sayest, 'To the age I am mistress,' While you hast not laid these things to your heart, You hast not remembered the latter end of it.
\v 8 And now, hear this, O luxurious one, Who is sitting confidently — Who is saying in her heart, 'I am, and none else, I sit not a widow, nor know bereavement.'
\v 9 And come in to you do these two things, In a moment, in one day, childlessness and widowhood, According to their perfection they have come upon you, In the multitude of your sorceries, In the exceeding might of your charms.
\v 10 And you are confident in your wickedness, You hast said, 'There is none seeing me,' Your wisdom and your knowledge, It is turning you back, And you sayest in your heart, 'I am, and none else.'
\v 11 And come in on you had evil, You knowest not its rising, And fall on you did mischief, You are not able to pacify it, And come on you suddenly did desolation, You knowest not.
\v 12 Stand, I pray you, in your charms, And in the multitude of your sorceries, In which you hast laboured from your youth, It may be you are able to profit, It may be you will terrify!
\v 13 You hast been wearied in the multitude of your counsels, Stand up, I pray you, and save you, Let the charmers of the heavens, Those looking on the stars, Those teaching concerning the months, From those things that come on you!
\v 14 Lo, they have been as stubble! Fire had burned them, They deliver not themselves from the power of the flame, There is not a coal to warm them, a light to sit before it.
\v 15 So have they been to you with whom you hast laboured, Your merchants from your youth, Each to his passage they have wandered, Your saviour is not!
\c 48
\v 1 Hear you this, O house of Jacob, Who are called by the name of Israel, And from the waters of Judah came out, Who are swearing by the name of Yahweh, And of the God of Israel make mention, Not in truth nor in righteousness.
\v 2 For from the Holy City they have been called, And on the God of Israel been supported, Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
\v 3 The former things from that time I declared, And from my mouth they have gone forth, And I proclaim them, Suddenly I have done, and it came.
\v 4 From my knowing that you are obstinate, And a sinew of iron your neck, And your forehead brass,
\v 5 And I declare to you from that time, Before it came I have caused you to hear, Lest you say, 'Mine idol had done them, And my graven image, And my molten image did command them.
\v 6 You hast heard, see the whole of it, And you, do you not declare? I have caused you to hear new things from this time, And things reserved that you knew not.
\v 7 Now they have been produced and not from that time, Yea, before the day, and you hast not heard them, Lest you say, 'Lo, I have known them.'
\v 8 Yea, you hast not heard, Yea, you hast not known, Yea, from that time not opened had yours ear, For I have known you dealest treacherously, And 'Transgressor from the belly,' One is crying to you.
\v 9 For My name's sake I defer Mine anger, And My praise I restrain for you, So as not to cut you off.
\v 10 Lo, I have refined you, and not with silver, I have chosen you in a furnace of affliction.
\v 11 For My sake, for Mine own sake, I do it, For how is it polluted? And Mine honour to another I give not.
\v 12 Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called one, I am He, I am first, and I am last;
\v 13 Also, My hand had founded earth, And My right hand stretched out the heavens, I am calling unto them, they stand together.
\v 14 Be gathered all of you, and hear, Who among them did declare these things? Yahweh had loved him, He did His pleasure on Babylon, And His arm is on the Chaldeans.
\v 15 I — I have spoken, yea, I have called him, I have brought him in, And he had made prosperous his way.
\v 16 Come you near unto me, hear this, Not from the beginning in secret spake I, From the time of its being, there am I, And now the Lord Yahweh had sent me, and His Spirit.
\v 17 Thus said Yahweh, your redeemer, The Holy One of Israel, 'I am Yahweh your God, teaching you to profit, Causing you to tread in the way you goest.
\v 18 O that you hadst attended to My commands, Then as a river is your peace, And your righteousness as billows of the sea,
\v 19 And as sand is your seed, And the offspring of your bowels as its gravel, Not cut off nor destroyed his name before Me.
\v 20 Go out from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, With a voice of singing declare, Cause you this to be heard, Bring it forth unto the end of the earth, Say, Redeemed had Yahweh His servant Jacob.
\v 21 And they have not thirsted in waste places, He had caused them to go on, Waters from a rock he had caused to flow to them, Yea, he cleaveth a rock, and flow do waters.
\v 22 There is no peace, said Yahweh, to the wicked!
\c 49
\v 1 Hearken, O isles, unto me, And attend, O peoples, from afar, Yahweh from the womb had called me, From the bowels of my mother He had made mention of my name.
\v 2 And he made my mouth as a sharp sword, In the shadow of His hand He had hid me, And He made me for a clear arrow, In His quiver He had hid me.
\v 3 And He said to me, 'My servant You are, O Israel, In whom I beautify Myself.'
\v 4 And I said, 'For a vain thing I laboured, For emptiness and vanity my power I consumed, But my judgment is with Yahweh, And my wage with my God.
\v 5 And now, said Yahweh, who is forming me from the belly for a servant to Him, To bring back Jacob unto Him, (Yough Israel is not gathered, Yet I am honoured in the eyes of Yahweh, And my God had been my strength.)
\v 6 And He said, 'It had been a light thing That you are to Me for a servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And the preserved of Israel to bring back, And I have given you for a light of nations, To be My salvation unto the end of the earth.'
\v 7 Thus said Yahweh, Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, To the despised in soul, To the abominated of a nation, To the servant of rulers: 'Kings see, and have risen, princes, and worship, For the sake of Yahweh, who is faithful, The Holy of Israel, and He chooseth you.'
\v 8 Thus said Yahweh: 'In a time of good pleasure I answered you, And in a day of salvation I helped you, And I keep you, and give you, For a covenant of the people, To establish the earth, To cause to inherit desolate inheritances.
\v 9 To say to the bound, Go out, To those in darkness, Be uncovered. On the ways they feed, And in all high places is their pasture.
\v 10 They do not hunger, nor thirst, Nor smite them did mirage and sun, For He who is pitying them did lead them, And by fountains of waters did tend them.
\v 11 And I have made all My mountains for a way, And My highways are lifted up.
\v 12 Lo, these from afar come in, And behold, these from the north, and from the sea, And these from the land of Sinim.
\v 13 Sing, O heavens, and joy, O earth, And break forth, O mountains, with singing, For comforted had Yahweh His people, And His afflicted ones He did pity.
\v 14 And Zion said, 'Yahweh had forsaken me, And my Lord had forgotten me.'
\v 15 Forget did a woman her suckling, The loved one — the son of her womb? Yea, these forget — but I — I forget not you.
\v 16 Lo, on the palms of the hand I have graven you, Your walls are before Me continually.
\v 17 Hastened have those building you, Those destroying you, and laying you waste, go out from you.
\v 18 Lift up round about yours eyes and see, All of them have been gathered, They have come to you. I live, an affirmation of Yahweh! Surely all of them as an ornament you puttest on, And you bindest them on like a bride.
\v 19 Because your wastes, and your desolate places, And the land of your ruins, Surely now are straitened because of inhabitants, And far off have been those consuming you.
\v 20 Again do the sons of your bereavement say in yours ears: 'The place is too strait for me, Come nigh to me — and I dwell.'
\v 21 And you hast said in your heart: 'Who had begotten for me — these? And I bereaved and gloomy, A captive, and turned aside, And these — who had nourished? Lo, I — I was left by myself, these — whence are they?
\v 22 Thus said the Lord Yahweh: 'Lo, I lift up unto nations My hand, And unto peoples I raise up Mine ensign, And they have brought your sons in the bosom, And your daughters on the shoulder are carried.
\v 23 And kings have been your nursing fathers, And their princesses your nursing mothers; Face to the earth — they bow down to you, And the dust of your feet they lick up, And you hast known that I am Yahweh, That those expecting Me are not ashamed.
\v 24 Is prey taken from the mighty? And the captive of the righteous delivered?
\v 25 For thus said Yahweh: Even the captive of the mighty is taken, And the prey of the terrible is delivered, And with your striver I strive, and your sons I save.
\v 26 And I have caused yours oppressors to eat their own flesh, And as new wine they drink their own blood, And known have all flesh that I, Yahweh, Your saviour, and your redeemer, Am the Mighty One of Jacob!'
\c 50
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh: 'Where is this — the bill of your mother's divorce, Whom I sent away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Lo, for your iniquities you have been sold, And for your transgressions Hath your mother been sent away.
\v 2 Wherefore have I come, and there is no one? I called, and there is none answering, Hath My hand been at all short of redemption? And is there not in me power to deliver? Lo, by My rebuke I dry up a sea, I make rivers a wilderness, Their fish stinketh, for there is no water, And dieth with thirst.
\v 3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, And sackcloth I make their covering.
\v 4 The Lord Yahweh had given to me The tongue of taught ones, To know to aid the weary by a word, He waketh morning by morning, He waketh for me an ear to hear as taught ones.
\v 5 The Lord Yahweh opened for me the ear, And I rebelled not — backward I moved not.
\v 6 My back I have given to those smiting, And my cheeks to those plucking out, My face I hid not from shame and spitting.
\v 7 And the Lord Yahweh gave help to me, Therefore I have not been ashamed, Therefore I have set my face as a flint, And I know that I am not ashamed.
\v 8 Near is He who is justifying me, Who did contend with me? We stand together, who is mine opponent? Let him come nigh unto me.
\v 9 Lo, the Lord Yahweh gave help to me, Who is he that declareth me wicked? Lo, all of them as a garment wear out, A moth did eat them.
\v 10 Who is among you, fearing Yahweh, Hearkening to the voice of His servant, That had walked in dark places, And there is no brightness for him? Let him trust in the name of Yahweh, And lean upon his God.
\v 11 Lo, all you kindling a fire, girding on sparks, Walk you in the light of your fire, And in the sparks you have caused to burn, From my hand had this been to you, In grief you lie down!
\c 51
\v 1 Hearken unto Me, you pursuing righteousness, Seeking Yahweh, Look attentively unto the rock — you have been hewn, And unto the hole of the pit — you have been digged.
\v 2 Look attentively unto Abraham your father, And unto Sarah — she brought you forth, For — one — I have called him, And I bless him, and multiply him.
\v 3 For Yahweh had comforted Zion, He had comforted all her wastes, And He setteth her wilderness as Eden, And her desert as a garden of Yahweh, Joy, yea, gladness is found in her, Confession, and the voice of song.
\v 4 Attend unto Me, O My people, And, O My nation, unto Me give ear. For a law from Me went out, And My judgment to the light, Peoples I do cause to rest.
\v 5 Near is My righteousness, Gone out had My salvation and Mine arms, Peoples they judge, on Me isles do wait, Yea, on Mine arm they do wait with hope.
\v 6 Lift you up to the heavens your eyes, And look attentively unto the earth beneath, For the heavens as smoke have vanished, And the earth as a garment weareth out, And its inhabitants as gnats do die, And My salvation is to the age, And My righteousness is not broken.
\v 7 Hearken unto Me, you who know righteousness, A people, in whose heart is My law, Fear you not the reproach of men, And for their reviling be not frightened,
\v 8 For as a garment eat them did a moth, And as wool eat them did a worm, And My righteousness is to the age, And My salvation to all generations.
\v 9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Yahweh, Awake, as in days of old, generations of the ages, Art not You it that is hewing down Rahab, Piercing a dragon!
\v 10 Art not You it that is drying up a sea, Waters of a great deep? That had made deep places of a sea A way for the passing of the redeemed?
\v 11 And the ransomed of Yahweh turn back, And they have come to Zion with singing, And joy age-during is on their head, Gladness and joy they attain, Fled away have sorrow and sighing,
\v 12 I — I am He — your comforter, Who are you — and you are afraid of man? he dieth! And of the son of man — grass he is made!
\v 13 And you will forget Yahweh your maker, Who is stretching out the heavens, and founding earth, And you will fear continually all the day, Because of the fury of the oppressor, As he had prepared to destroy. And where is the fury of the oppressor?
\v 14 Hastened had a wanderer to be loosed, And he did not die at the pit, And his bread is not lacking.
\v 15 And I am Yahweh your God, Quieting the sea, when its billows roar, Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
\v 16 And I put My words in your mouth, And with the shadow of My hand have covered you, To plant the heavens, and to found earth, And to say to Zion, 'My people are you.'
\v 17 Stir thyself, stir thyself, rise, Jerusalem, Who hast drunk from the hand of Yahweh The cup of His fury, The goblet, the cup of trembling, you hast drunk, You hast wrung out.
\v 18 There is not a leader to her Out of all the sons she had borne, And there is none laying hold on her hand Out of all the sons she had nourished.
\v 19 These two are meeting you, who is moved for you? Spoiling and destruction — Famine and sword, who — I comfort you?
\v 20 Your sons have been wrapped up, they have lain down, At the head of all out places, as a wild ox in a net, They are full of the fury of Yahweh, The rebuke of Your God.
\v 21 Therefore, hear, I pray you, this, O afflicted and drunken one, and not with wine,
\v 22 Thus said your Lord Yahweh, and your God, He pleadeth for his people: 'Lo, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, The goblet, the cup of My fury, You will not add to drink it any more.
\v 23 And I have put it into the hand of those afflicting you, Who have said to your soul, Bow down, and we pass over, And you makest as the earth your body, And as the street to those passing by!'
\c 52
\v 1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion, Put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem — the Holy City; For enter no more into you again, Do the uncircumcised and unclean.
\v 2 Shake thyself from dust, arise, sit, O Jerusalem, Bands of your neck have loosed themselves, O captive, daughter of Zion.
\v 3 For thus said Yahweh: 'For nought you have been sold, And not by money are you redeemed.'
\v 4 For thus said the Lord Yahweh: 'To Egypt My people went down at first to sojourn there, And Asshur — for nought he had oppressed it.
\v 5 And now, what — to Me here, An affirmation of Yahweh, That taken is My people for nought? Its rulers cause howling, — an affirmation of Yahweh, And continually all the day My name is despised.
\v 6 Therefore did My people know My name, Therefore, in that day, Surely I am He who is speaking, behold Me.'
\v 7 How comely on the mountains, Have been the feet of one proclaiming tidings, Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings, Sounding salvation, Saying to Zion, 'Reigned had your God.'
\v 8 The voice of your watchmen! They have lifted up the voice, together they cry aloud, Because eye to eye they see, in Yahweh's turning back to Zion.
\v 9 Break forth, sing together, O wastes of Jerusalem, For Yahweh had comforted His people, He had redeemed Jerusalem.
\v 10 Yahweh had made bare His holy arm Before the eyes of all the nations, And seen have all the ends of the earth, The salvation of our God.
\v 11 Turn aside, turn aside, go out there, The unclean touch not, go out from her middle, Be you pure, who are bearing the weapons of Yahweh.
\v 12 For not in haste do you go out, Yea, with flight you go not on, For going before you is Yahweh, And gathering you is the God of Israel!
\v 13 Lo, My servant did act wisely, He is high, and had been lifted up, And had been very high.
\v 14 As astonished at you have been many, (So marred by man his appearance, And his form by sons of men.)
\v 15 So did he sprinkle many nations. Concerning him kings shut their mouth, For that which was not recounted to them they have seen, And that which they had not heard they have understood!
\c 53
\v 1 Who had given credence to that which we heard? And the arm of Yahweh, On whom had it been revealed?
\v 2 Yea, he came up as a tender plant before Him, And as a root out of a dry land, He had no form, nor honour, when we observe him, Nor appearance, when we desire him.
\v 3 He is despised, and left of men, A man of pains, and acquainted with sickness, And as one hiding the face from us, He is despised, and we esteemed him not.
\v 4 Surely our sicknesses he had borne, And our pains — he had carried them, And we — we have esteemed him plagued, Smitten of God, and afflicted.
\v 5 And he is pierced for our transgressions, Bruised for our iniquities, The chastisement of our peace is on him, And by his bruise there is healing to us.
\v 6 All of us like sheep have wandered, Each to his own way we have turned, And Yahweh had caused to meet on him, The punishment of us all.
\v 7 It had been exacted, and he had answered, And he opened not his mouth, As a lamb to the slaughter he is brought, And as a sheep before its shearers is dumb, And he opened not his mouth.
\v 8 By restraint and by judgment he had been taken, And of his generation who did meditate, That he had been cut off from the land of the living? By the transgression of My people he is plagued,
\v 9 And it appointeth with the wicked his grave, And with the rich are his high places, Because he had done no violence, Nor is deceit in his mouth.
\v 10 And Yahweh had delighted to bruise him, He had made him sick, If his soul did make an offering for guilt, He saw seed — he prolongeth days, And the pleasure of Yahweh in his hand did prosper.
\v 11 Of the labour of his soul he saw — he is satisfied, Through his knowledge give righteousness Doth the righteous one, My servant, to many, And their iniquities he did bear.
\v 12 Therefore I give a portion to him among the many, And with the mighty he apportioneth spoil, Because that he exposed to death his soul, And with transgressors he was numbered, And he the sin of many had borne, And for transgressors he intercedeth.
\c 54
\v 1 Sing, O barren, she had not borne! Break forth with singing, and cry aloud, She had not brought forth! For more are the sons of the desolate, Than the sons of the married one, said Yahweh.
\v 2 Enlarge the place of your tent, And the curtains of your tabernacles they stretch out, Restrain not — lengthen your cords, And your pins make strong.
\v 3 For right and left you breakest forth, And your seed did nations possess,
\v 4 And desolate cities they cause to be inhabited. Fear not, for you are not ashamed, Nor blush, for you are not confounded, For the shame of your youth you forgettest, And the reproach of your widowhood You will not remember any more.
\v 5 For your Maker is your husband, Yahweh of Hosts is His name, And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, 'God of all the earth,' He is called.
\v 6 For, as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, Called you had Yahweh, Even a youthful wife when she is refused, said your God.
\v 7 In a small moment I have forsaken you, And in great mercies I do gather you,
\v 8 In overflowing wrath I hid my face for a moment from you, And in kindness age-during I have loved you, Said your Redeemer — Yahweh!
\v 9 For, the waters of Noah is this to Me, In that I have sworn — the waters of Noah Do not pass again over the earth — So I have sworn, Wrath is not upon you, Nor rebuke against you.
\v 10 For the mountains depart, and the hills remove, And My kindness from you departs not, And the covenant of My peace removeth not, Said had your loving one — Yahweh.
\v 11 O afflicted, storm-tossed, not comforted, Lo, I am laying with cement your stones, And have founded you with sapphires,
\v 12 And have made of agate your pinnacles, And your gates of carbuncle stones, And all your border of stones of delight,
\v 13 And all your sons are taught of Yahweh, And abundant is the peace of your sons.
\v 14 In righteousness you establishest thyself, Be far from oppression, for you fearest not, And from ruin, for it came not near unto you.
\v 15 Lo, he did diligently assemble without My desire, Who had assembled near you? By you he falleth!
\v 16 Lo, I — I have prepared an artisan, Blowing on a fire of coals, And bringing out an instrument for his work, And I have prepared a destroyer to destroy.
\v 17 No weapon formed against you prospereth, And every tongue rising against you, In judgment you condemnest. This is the inheritance of the servants of Yahweh, And their righteousness from me, an affirmation of Yahweh!
\c 55
\v 1 Ho, every thirsty one, come you to the waters, And he who had no money, Come you, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Without money and without price, wine and milk.
\v 2 Why do you weigh money for that which is not bread? And your labour for that which is not for satiety? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat good, And your soul did delight itself in fatness.
\v 3 Incline your ear, and come unto me, Hear, and your soul did live, And I make for you a covenant age-during, The kind acts of David — that are stedfast.
\v 4 Lo, a witness to peoples I have given him, A leader and commander to peoples.
\v 5 Lo, a nation you knowest not, you callest, And a nation who know you not unto you do run, For the sake of Yahweh your God, And for the Holy One of Israel, Because He had beautified you.
\v 6 Seek you Yahweh, while He is found, Call you Him, while He is near,
\v 7 Forsake did the wicked his way, And the man of iniquity his thoughts, And he returneth to Yahweh, and He pitieth him, And unto our God for He multiplieth to pardon.
\v 8 For not My thoughts are your thoughts, Nor your ways My ways, — an affirmation of Yahweh,
\v 9 For high have the heavens been above the earth, So high have been My ways above your ways, And My thoughts above your thoughts.
\v 10 For, as come down did the shower, And the snow from the heavens, And thither returneth not, But had watered the earth, And had caused it to yield, and to spring up, And had given seed to the sower, and bread to the eater,
\v 11 So is My word that went out of My mouth, It turneth not back unto Me empty, But had done that which I desired, And prosperously effected that for which I sent it.
\v 12 For with joy you go forth, And with peace you are brought in, The mountains and the hills Break forth before you with singing, And all trees of the field clap the hand.
\v 13 Instead of the thorn come up did fir, Instead of the brier come up did myrtle, And it had been to Yahweh for a name, For a sign age-during — it is not cut off!
\c 56
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh: 'Keep you judgment, and do righteousness, For near is My salvation to come, And My righteousness to be revealed.'
\v 2 O the happiness of a man who did this, And of a son of man who keepeth hold on it, Keeping the sabbath from polluting it, And keeping his hand from doing any evil.
\v 3 Nor speak let a son of the stranger, Who is joined unto Yahweh, saying: 'Yahweh did certainly separate me from His people.' Nor say let the eunuch, 'Lo, I am a tree dried up,'
\v 4 For thus said Yahweh of the eunuchs, Who do keep My sabbaths, And have fixed on that which I desired, And are keeping hold on My covenant:
\v 5 I have given to them in My house, And within My walls a station and a name, Better than sons and than daughters, A name age-during I give to him That is not cut off.
\v 6 And sons of the stranger, who are joined to Yahweh, To serve Him, and to love the name of Yahweh, To be to Him for servants, Every keeper of the sabbath from polluting it, And those keeping hold on My covenant.
\v 7 I have brought them unto My holy mountain, And caused them to rejoice in My house of prayer, Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices Are for a pleasing thing on Mine altar, For My house, 'A house of prayer,' Is called for all the peoples.
\v 8 An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh, Who is gathering the outcasts of Israel: 'Again I gather to him — to his gathered ones.'
\v 9 Every beast of the field, Come to devour, every beast in the forest.
\v 10 Blind are his watchmen — all of them, They have not known, All of them are dumb dogs, they are not able to bark, Dozing, lying down, loving to slumber.
\v 11 And the dogs are strong of desire, They have not known sufficiency, And they are shepherds! They have not known understanding, All of them to their own way they did turn, Each to his dishonest gain from his quarter:
\v 12 Come you, I take wine, And we drink, quaff strong drink, And as this day had been to-morrow, Great — exceeding abundant!'
\c 57
\v 1 The righteous had perished, And there is none laying it to heart, And men of kindness are gathered, Without any considering that from the face of evil Gathered is the righteous one.
\v 2 He entereth into peace, they rest on their beds, Each is going straightforward.
\v 3 And you, come near hither, O sons of a sorceress, seed of an adulterer, Even you will commit whoredom.
\v 4 Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom enlarge you the mouth? Prolong you the tongue? Are not you children of transgression? a false seed?
\v 5 Who are inflamed among oaks, under every green tree, Slaughtering the children in valleys, Under clefts of the rocks.
\v 6 Among the smooth things of a brook is your portion, They — they are your lot, Also to them you hast poured out an oblation, You hast caused a present to ascend, For these things am I comforted?
\v 7 On a mountain, high and exalted, You hast set your couch, Also thither you hast gone up to make a sacrifice.
\v 8 And behind the door, and the post, You hast set up your memorial, For from Me you hast removed, and goest up, You hast enlarged your couch, And will covenant for thyself among them, You hast loved their couch, the station you sawest,
\v 9 And goest joyfully to the king in ointment, And will multiply your perfumes, And sendest yours ambassadors afar off, And humblest thyself unto Sheol.
\v 10 In the greatness of your way you hast laboured, You hast not said, 'It is desperate.' The life of your hand you hast found, Therefore you hast not been sick.
\v 11 And of whom hast you been afraid, and fearest, That you liest, and Me hast not remembered? You hast not laid it to your heart, Am not I silent, even from of old? And Me you fearest not?
\v 12 I declare your righteousness, and your works, And they do not profit you.
\v 13 When you criest, let your gatherings deliver you, And all of them carry away did wind, Take away did vanity, And whoso is trusting in Me inheriteth the land, And did possess My holy mountain.
\v 14 And he had said, 'Raise up, raise up, prepare a way, Lift a stumbling-block out of the way of My people.'
\v 15 For thus said the high and exalted One, Inhabiting eternity, and holy is His name: 'In the high and holy place I dwell, And with the bruised and humble of spirit, To revive the spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart of bruised ones,'
\v 16 For, not to the age do I strive, nor for ever am I wroth, For the spirit from before Me is feeble, And the souls I have made.
\v 17 For the iniquity of his dishonest gain, I have been wroth, and I smite him, Hiding — and am wroth, And he went on turning back in the way of his heart.
\v 18 His ways I have seen, and I heal him, yea, I lead him, And recompense comforts to him and to his mourning ones.
\v 19 Producing the fruit of the lips, 'Peace, peace,' to the far off, and to the near, And I have healed him, said Yahweh.
\v 20 And the wicked are as the driven out sea, For to rest it is not able, And its waters cast out filth and mire.
\v 21 There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked!
\c 58
\v 1 Call with the throat, restrain not, As a trumpet lift up your voice, And declare to My people their transgression, And to the house of Jacob their sins;
\v 2 Seeing — Me day by day they seek, And the knowledge of My ways they desire, As a nation that righteousness had done, And the judgment of its God had not forsaken, They ask of me judgments of righteousness, The drawing near of God they desire:
\v 3 'Why have we fasted, and You hast not seen? We have afflicted our soul, and You knowest not.' Lo, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, And all your labours you exact.
\v 4 Lo, for strife and debate you fast, And to smite with the fist of wickedness, Ye fast not as to -day, To sound in the high place your voice.
\v 5 Like this is the fast that I choose? The day of a man's afflicting his soul? To bow as a reed his head, And sackcloth and ashes spread out? This will you call a fast, And a desirable day — to Yahweh?
\v 6 Is not this the fast that I chose — To loose the bands of wickedness, To shake off the burdens of the yoke, And to send out the oppressed free, And every yoke you draw off?
\v 7 Is it not to deal to the hungry your bread, And the mourning poor bring home, That you seest the naked and cover him, And from yours own flesh hide not thyself?
\v 8 Then broken up as the dawn is your light, And your health in haste springeth up, Gone before you had your righteousness, The honour of Yahweh did gather you.
\v 9 Then you callest, and Yahweh answereth, You criest, and He said, 'Behold Me.' If you turn aside from your middle the yoke, The sending forth of the finger, And the speaking of vanity,
\v 10 And will bring out to the hungry your soul, And the afflicted soul will satisfy, Then risen in the darkness had your light, And your thick darkness is as noon.
\v 11 And Yahweh did lead you continually, And had satisfied in drought your soul, And your bones He armeth, And you hast been as a watered garden, And as an outlet of waters, whose waters lie not.
\v 12 And they have built out of you the wastes of old, The foundations of many generations you raisest up, And one called you, 'Repairer of the breach, Restorer of paths to rest in.'
\v 13 If you will turn from the sabbath your foot, Doing yours own pleasure on My holy day, And hast cried to the sabbath, 'A delight,' To the holy of Yahweh, 'Honoured,' And hast honoured it, without doing yours own ways, Without finding yours own pleasure, And speaking a word.
\v 14 Then will you delight thyself on Yahweh, And I have caused you to ride on high places of earth, And have caused you to eat the inheritance of Jacob your father, For the mouth of Yahweh had spoken!
\c 59
\v 1 Lo, the hand of Yahweh Hath not been shortened from saving, Nor heavy his ear from hearing.
\v 2 But your iniquities have been separating Between you and your God, And your sins have hidden The Presence from you — from hearing.
\v 3 For your hands have been polluted with blood, And your fingers with iniquity, Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your tongue perverseness did mutter.
\v 4 There is none calling in righteousness, And there is none pleading in faithfulness, Trusting on emptiness, and speaking falsehood, Conceiving perverseness, and bearing iniquity.
\v 5 Eggs of a viper they have hatched, And webs of a spider they weave, Whoso is eating their eggs did die, And the crushed hatcheth a viper.
\v 6 Their webs become not a garment, Nor do they cover themselves with their works, Their works are works of iniquity, And a deed of violence is in their hands.
\v 7 Their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed innocent blood, Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, Spoiling and destruction are in their highways.
\v 8 A way of peace they have not known, And there is no judgment in their paths, Their paths they have made perverse for themselves, No treader in it had known peace.
\v 9 Therefore had judgment been far from us, And righteousness reacheth us not, We wait for light, and behold, darkness, For brightness — in thick darkness we go,
\v 10 We feel like the blind for the wall, Yea, as without eyes we feel, We have stumbled at noon as at twilight, In desolate places as the dead.
\v 11 We make a noise as bears — all of us, And as doves we coo sorely; We wait for judgment, and there is none, For salvation — it had been far from us.
\v 12 For our transgressions have been multiplied before Thee, And our sins have testified against us, For our transgressions are with us, And our iniquities — we have known them.
\v 13 Transgressing, and lying against Yahweh, And removing from after our God, Speaking oppression and apostasy, Conceiving and uttering from the heart Words of falsehood.
\v 14 And removed backward is judgment, And righteousness afar off standeth, For truth had been feeble in the street, And straightforwardness is not able to enter,
\v 15 And the truth is lacking, And whoso is turning aside from evil, Is making himself a spoil. And Yahweh saw, and it is evil in His eyes, That there is no judgment.
\v 16 And He saw that there is no man, And is astonished that there is no intercessor, And His own arm gave salvation to Him, And His righteousness — it sustained Him.
\v 17 And He putteth on righteousness as a breastplate, And an helmet of salvation on His head, And He putteth on garments of vengeance for clothing, And is covered, as with an upper-robe, with zeal.
\v 18 According to deeds — so He repayeth. Fury to His adversaries, their deed to His enemies, To the isles their deed He repayeth.
\v 19 And they fear from the west the name of Yahweh, And from the rising of the sun — His honour, When come in as a flood did an adversary, The Spirit of Yahweh had raised an ensign against him.
\v 20 And come to Zion had a redeemer, Even to captives of transgression in Jacob, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 21 And I — this is My covenant with them, said Yahweh, My Spirit that is on you, And My words that I have put in your mouth, Depart not from your mouth, And from the mouth of your seed, And from the mouth of your seed's seed, said Yahweh, From henceforth unto the age!
\c 60
\v 1 Arise, be bright, for come had your light, And the honour of Yahweh had risen on you.
\v 2 For, behold, the darkness did cover the earth, And thick darkness the peoples, And on you rise did Yahweh, And His honour on you is seen.
\v 3 And come have nations to your light, And kings to the brightness of your rising.
\v 4 Lift up round about yours eyes and see, All of them have been gathered, they have come to you, Your sons from afar do come, And your daughters on the side are supported.
\v 5 Then you seest, and hast become bright, And yours heart had been afraid and enlarged, For turn unto you did the multitude of the sea, The forces of nations do come to you.
\v 6 A company of camels covereth you, Dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, All of them from Sheba do come, Gold and frankincense they bear, And of the praises of Yahweh they proclaim the tidings.
\v 7 All the flock of Kedar are gathered to you, The rams of Nebaioth do serve you, They ascend for acceptance Mine altar, And the house of My beauty I beautify.
\v 8 Who are these — as a thick cloud they fly, And as doves unto their windows?
\v 9 Surely for Me isles do wait, And ships of Tarshish first, To bring your sons from afar, Their silver and their gold with them, To the name of Yahweh your God, And to the Holy One of Israel, Because He had beautified you.
\v 10 And sons of a stranger have built your walls, And their kings do serve you, For in My wrath I have smitten you, And in My good pleasure I have pitied you.
\v 11 And opened have your gates continually, By day and by night they are not shut, To bring unto you the force of nations, Even their kings are led.
\v 12 For the nation and the kingdom that do not serve you perish, Yea, the nations are utterly wasted.
\v 13 The honour of Lebanon unto you did come, Fir, pine, and box together, To beautify the place of My sanctuary, And the place of My feet I make honourable.
\v 14 And come unto you, bowing down, Have sons of those afflicting you, And bowed themselves to the soles of your feet Have all despising you, And they have cried to you: 'City of Yahweh, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.'
\v 15 Instead of your being forsaken and hated, And none passing through, I have made you for an excellency age-during, A joy of generation and generation.
\v 16 And you hast sucked the milk of nations, Yea, the breast of kings you suckest, And you hast known that I, Yahweh, Your Saviour, and Your Redeemer, Am the Mighty One of Jacob.
\v 17 Instead of the brass I bring in gold, And instead of the iron I bring in silver, And instead of the wood brass, And instead of the stone iron, And I have made your inspection peace, And your exactors righteousness.
\v 18 Violence is not heard any more in your land, Spoiling and destruction in your borders, And you hast called 'Salvation' your walls, And your gates, 'Praise.'
\v 19 To you no more is the sun for a light by day, And for brightness the moon gave not light to you, And Yahweh had become to you A light age-during, and your God your beauty.
\v 20 Your sun went no more in, And your moon is not removed, For Yahweh became to you a light age-during. And the days of your mourning have been completed.
\v 21 And your people are all of them righteous, To the age they possess the earth, A branch of My planting, A work of My hands, to be beautified.
\v 22 The little one did become a chief, And the small one a mighty nation, I, Yahweh, in its own time do hasten it!
\c 61
\v 1 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me, Because Yahweh did anoint me To proclaim tidings to the humble, He sent me to bind the broken of heart, To proclaim to captives liberty, And to bound ones an opening of bands.
\v 2 To proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Yahweh, And the day of vengeance of our God, To comfort all mourners.
\v 3 To appoint to mourners in Zion, To give to them beauty instead of ashes, The oil of joy instead of mourning, A covering of praise for a spirit of weakness, And He is calling to them, 'Trees of righteousness, The planting of Yahweh — to be beautified.'
\v 4 And they have built the wastes of old, The desolations of the ancients they raise up, And they have renewed waste cities, The desolations of generation and generation.
\v 5 And strangers have stood and fed your flock, Sons of a foreigner are your husbandmen, And your vine-dressers.
\v 6 And you are called 'Priests of Yahweh,' 'Ministers of our God,' is said of you, The strength of nations you consume, And in their honour you do boast yourselves.
\v 7 Instead of your shame and confusion, A second time they sing of their portion, Therefore in their land A second time do they take possession, Joy age-during is for them.
\v 8 For I am Yahweh, loving judgment, Hating plunder for a burnt-offering, And I have given their wage in truth, And a covenant age-during I make for them.
\v 9 And known among nations had been their seed, And their offspring in the middle of the peoples, All their beholders acknowledge them, For they are a seed Yahweh had blessed.
\v 10 I greatly rejoice in Yahweh, Joy did my soul in my God, For He clothed me with garments of salvation, With a robe of righteousness covereth Me, As a bridegroom prepared ornaments, And as a bride putteth on her jewels.
\v 11 For, as the earth brought forth her shoots, And as a garden caused its sown things to shoot up, So the Lord Yahweh caused righteousness and praise To shoot up before all the nations!
\c 62
\v 1 For Zion's sake I am not silent, And for Jerusalem's sake I do not rest, Till her righteousness go out as brightness, And her salvation, as a torch that burneth.
\v 2 And nations have seen your righteousness, And all kings yours honour, And He is giving to you a new name, That the mouth of Yahweh did define.
\v 3 And you hast been a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, And a diadem of royalty in the hand of your God,
\v 4 It is not said of you any more, 'Forsaken!' And of your land it is not said any more, 'Desolate,' For to you is cried, 'My delight is in her,' And to your land, 'Married,' For Yahweh had delighted in you, And your land is married.
\v 5 For a young man did marry a virgin, Your Builders do marry you, With the joy of a bridegroom over a bride, Rejoice over you did your God.
\v 6 'On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen, All the day, and all the night, Continually, they are not silent.' O you remembrancers of Yahweh, Keep not silence for yourselves,
\v 7 And give not silence to Him, Till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem A praise in the earth.
\v 8 Sworn had Yahweh by His right hand, Even by the arm of His strength: 'I give not your corn any more as food for yours enemies, Nor do sons of a stranger drink your new wine, For which you hast laboured.
\v 9 For, those gathering it do eat it, and have praised Yahweh, And those collecting it do drink it in My holy courts.'
\v 10 Pass you on, pass on through the gates, Prepare you the way of the people, Raise up, raise up the highway, clear it from stones, Lift up an ensign over the peoples.
\v 11 Lo, Yahweh had proclaimed unto the end of the earth: 'Say you to the daughter of Zion, Lo, your salvation had come,' Lo, his hire is with him, and his wage before him.
\v 12 And they have cried to them, 'People of the Holy One, Redeemed of Yahweh,' Yea, to you is called, 'Sought out one, a city not forsaken!'
\c 63
\v 1 Who is this coming from Edom? With dyed garments from Bozrah? This that is honourable in his clothing, Travelling in the abundance of his power?' — 'I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.'
\v 2 Wherefore is your clothing red? And your garments as treading in a wine fat?'
\v 3  — 'A wine-press I have trodden by myself, And of the peoples there is no one with me, And I tread them in mine anger, And I trample them in my fury, Sprinkled is their strength on my garments, And all my clothing I have polluted.
\v 4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart, And the year of my redeemed had come.
\v 5 And I look attentively, and there is none helping, And I am astonished that there is none supporting, And give salvation to me did mine own arm. And my wrath — it had supported me.
\v 6 And I tread down peoples in mine anger, And I make them drunk in my fury, And I bring down to earth their strength.
\v 7 The kind acts of Yahweh I make mention of, The praises of Yahweh, According to all that Yahweh had done for us, And the abundance of the goodness to the house of Israel, That He had done for them, According to His mercies, And according to the abundance of His kind acts.
\v 8 And He said, Only My people they are, Sons — they lie not, and He is to them for a saviour.
\v 9 In all their distress He is no adversary, And the messenger of His presence saved them, In His love and in His pity He redeemed them, And He did lift them up, And beareth them all the days of old.
\v 10 And they have rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit, And He turneth to them for an enemy, He Himself had fought against them.
\v 11 And He remembered the days of old, Moses — his people. Where is He who is bringing them up from the sea, The shepherd of his flock? Where is He who is putting in its middle His Holy Spirit?
\v 12 Leading by the right hand of Moses, the arm of His glory, Cleaving waters from before them, To make to Himself a name age-during.
\v 13 Leading them through the depths, As a horse in a plain they stumble not.
\v 14 As a beast into a valley went down, The Spirit of Yahweh caused him to rest, So hast You led Your people, To make to Yourself a glorious name.
\v 15 Look attentively from the heavens, And see from Your holy and beauteous habitation, Where is Your zeal and Your might? The multitude of Your bowels and Your mercies Towards me have refrained themselves.
\v 16 For You are our Father, For Abraham had not known us, And Israel did not acknowledge us, You, O Yahweh, are our Father, Our redeemer from the age, is Your name.
\v 17 Why causest You us to wander, O Yahweh, from Your ways? You hardenest our heart from Your fear, Turn back for Your servants' sake, The tribes of Thine inheritance.
\v 18 For a little while did Your holy people possess, Our adversaries have trodden down Your sanctuary.
\v 19 We have been from of old, You hast not ruled over them, Not called is Your name upon them!
\c 64
\v 1 Didst You not rend the heavens? You did come down, From your presence did mountains flow,
\v 2 (As fire kindleth stubble — Fire caused water to boil,) To make known Your name to Thine adversaries, From Your presence do nations tremble.
\v 3 In Your doing fearful things — we expect not, You did come down, From Your presence did mountains flow.
\v 4 Even from antiquity men have not heard, They have not given ear, Eye had not seen a God save Thee, He did work for those waiting for Him.
\v 5 You hast met with the rejoicer And the doer of righteousness, In Your ways they remember Thee, Lo, You hast been wroth when we sin, By them is continuance, and we are saved.
\v 6 And we are as unclean — all of us, And as a garment passing away, all our righteous acts; And we fade as a leaf — all of us. And our iniquities as wind do take us away.
\v 7 And there is none calling in Your name, Stirring up himself to lay hold on Thee, For You hast hid Your face from us, And you meltest us away by our iniquities.
\v 8 And now, O Yahweh, you are our Father, We are the clay, and You our Framer, And the work of Your hand — all of us.
\v 9 Be not wroth, O Yahweh, very sore, Nor for ever remember iniquity, Lo, look attentively, we beseech Thee, Your people are we all.
\v 10 Your holy cities have been a wilderness, Zion a wilderness had been, Jerusalem a desolation.
\v 11 Our holy and our beautiful house, Where praise Thee did our fathers, Hath become burnt with fire, And all our desirable things have become a waste.
\v 12 For these will You refrain Yourself, Yahweh? You are silent, and will afflict us very sore!'
\c 65
\v 1 I have been inquired of by those who asked not, I have been found by those who sought Me not, I have said, 'Behold Me, behold Me,' Unto a nation not calling in My name.
\v 2 I have spread out My hands all the day Unto an apostate people, Who are going in the way not good after their own thoughts.
\v 3 The people who are provoking Me to anger, To My face continually, Sacrificing in gardens, and making perfume on the bricks:
\v 4 Who are dwelling among sepulchres, And lodge in reserved places, Who are eating flesh of the sow, And a piece of abominable things — their vessels.
\v 5 Who are saying, 'Keep to thyself, come not nigh to me, For I have declared you unholy.' These are a smoke in Mine anger, A fire burning all the day.
\v 6 Lo, it is written before Me: 'I am not silent, but have recompensed; And I have recompensed into their bosom,
\v 7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, said Yahweh, Who have made perfume on the mountains, And on the heights have reproached Me, And I have measured their former work into their bosom.'
\v 8 Thus said Yahweh: As the new wine is found in the cluster, And one had said, 'Destroy it not for a blessing is in it,' So I do for My servants' sake, not to destroy the whole.
\v 9 And I have brought out from Jacob a seed, And from Judah a possessor of My mount, And possess it do My chosen ones, And My servants do dwell there.
\v 10 And Sharon had been for the habitation of a flock, And the valley of Achor for the lying down of a herd, For My people who have sought Me.
\v 11 And you are those forsaking Yahweh, Who are forgetting My holy mountain, Who are setting in array for Gad a table, And who are filling for Meni a mixture.
\v 12 And I have numbered you for the sword, And all of you for slaughter bow down, Because I called, and you have not answered, I have spoken, and you have not hearkened, And you do the evil thing in Mine eyes, And on that which I desired not — fixed.
\v 13 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh: Lo, My servants do eat, and you do hunger, Lo, My servants do drink, and you do thirst, Lo, My servants rejoice, and you are ashamed,
\v 14 Lo, My servants sing from joy of heart, And you cry from pain of heart, And from breaking of spirit you do howl.
\v 15 And you have left your name For an oath for My chosen ones, And the Lord Yahweh had put you to death, And to His servants He gave another name.
\v 16 So that he who is blessing himself in the earth, Doth bless himself In the God of faithfulness, And he who is swearing in the earth, Doth swear by the God of faithfulness, Because the former distresses have been forgotten, And because they have been hid from Mine eyes.
\v 17 For, behold, I am creating new heavens, and a new earth, And the former things are not remembered, Nor do they ascend on the heart.
\v 18 But joy you, and rejoice for ever, that I am Creator, For, behold, I am creating Jerusalem a rejoicing, And her people a joy.
\v 19 And I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, And have joyed in My people, And not heard in her any more Is the voice of weeping, and the voice of crying.
\v 20 There is not there any more a suckling of days, And an aged man who did not complete his days, For the youth a hundred years old dieth, And the sinner, a hundred years old, is lightly esteemed.
\v 21 And they have built houses, and inhabited, And planted vineyards, and eaten their fruit.
\v 22 They do not build, and another inhabit, They do not plant, and another eat, For as the days of a tree are the days of My people, And the work of their hands wear out do My chosen ones.
\v 23 They labour not for a vain thing, Nor do they bring forth for trouble, For the seed of the blessed of Yahweh are they, And their offspring with them.
\v 24 And it had come to pass, They do not yet call, and I answer, They are yet speaking, and I hear.
\v 25 Wolf and lamb do feed as one, And a lion as an ox eateth straw, As to the serpent — dust is its food, They do no evil, nor destroy, In all My holy mountain, said Yahweh!
\c 66
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh: The heavens are My throne, And the earth My footstool, Where is this — the house that you build for Me? And where is this — the place — My rest?
\v 2 And all these My hand had made, And all these things are, An affirmation of Yahweh! And unto this one I look attentively, Unto the humble and bruised in spirit, And who is trembling at My word.
\v 3 Whoso slaughtereth the ox smiteth a man, Whoso sacrificeth the lamb beheadeth a dog, Whoso is bringing up a present — The blood of a sow, Whoso is making mention of frankincense, Is blessing iniquity. Yea, they have fixed on their own ways, And in their abominations their soul had delighted.
\v 4 I also — I fix on their vexations, And their fears I bring in to them, Because I have called, and there is none answering, I spake, and they have not hearkened, And they do the evil things in Mine eyes, And on that which I desired not — fixed.
\v 5 Hear a word of Yahweh, Ye who are trembling unto His word, Said have your brethren who are hating you, Who are driving you out, for My name's sake: 'Honoured is Yahweh, and we look on your joy,' But they are ashamed.
\v 6 A voice of noise is from the city, a voice from the temple, The voice of Yahweh, giving recompence to His enemies.
\v 7 Before she is pained she had brought forth, Before a pang came to her, She had delivered a male.
\v 8 Who had heard anything like this? Who had seen anything like these? Is earth caused to bring forth in one day? Born is a nation at once? For she had been pained, Zion also had borne her sons.
\v 9 'Do I bring to the birth, And not cause to bring forth?' said Yahweh, 'Am not I He who is causing to beget? I have also restrained,' said your God.
\v 10 Rejoice you with Jerusalem, And be glad in her, all you loving her, Rejoice you with her for joy, All you are mourning for her,
\v 11 So that you suck, and have been satisfied, From the breast of her consolations, So that you wring out, and have delighted yourselves From the abundance of her honour.
\v 12 For thus said Yahweh: 'Lo, I am stretching out to her peace as a river, And as an overflowing stream the honour of nations, And you have sucked, on the side you are carried, And on the knees you are dandled.
\v 13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so do I comfort you, Yea, in Jerusalem you are comforted.
\v 14 And you have seen, and rejoiced had your heart, And your bones as tender grass do flourish, And the hand of Yahweh had been known unto His servants, And He had been indignant with His enemies.
\v 15 For, behold, Yahweh in fire came, And as a hurricane His chariots, To refresh in fury His anger, And His rebuke in flames of fire.
\v 16 For by fire and by His sword, Doth Yahweh do judgment with all flesh. And many have been Yahweh's pierced ones.'
\v 17 Those sanctifying and cleansing themselves at the gardens, After Ahad in the middle, Eating flesh of the sow, And of the abomination, and of the mouse, Together are consumed, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 18 And I — their works and their thoughts, I come to gather all the nations and tongues, And they have come and seen My honour.
\v 19 And I have set among them a sign, And have sent out of them those escaping unto the nations, (Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles that are far off,) Who have not heard My fame, nor seen Mine honour, And they have declared Mine honour among nations.
\v 20 And they have brought all your brethren out of all the nations, A present to Yahweh, On horses, and on chariot, and on litters, And on mules, and on dromedaries, Unto My holy mountain Jerusalem, said Yahweh, As the sons of Israel bring the present in a clean vessel, Into the house of Yahweh.
\v 21 And also of them I take for priests, For Levites, said Yahweh.
\v 22 For, as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making, Are standing before Me, An affirmation of Yahweh! So remain did your seed and your name.
\v 23 And it had been from month to month, And from sabbath to sabbath, Come do all flesh to bow themselves before Me, Said Yahweh.
\v 24 And they have gone forth, And looked on the carcases of the men Who are transgressing against me, For their worm dieth not, And their fire is not quenched, And they have been an abhorrence to all flesh!
