\v 1 A word of Yahweh that had been unto Joel, son of Pethuel:
\v 2 Hear this, you aged ones, And give ear, all you inhabitants of the land, Hath this been in your days? Or in the days of your fathers?
\v 3 Concerning it to your sons talk you, And your sons to their sons, And their sons to another generation.
\v 4 What is left of the palmer-worm, eaten had the locust, And what is left of the locust, Eaten had the cankerworm, And what is left of the cankerworm, Eaten had the caterpillar.
\v 5 Awake, you drunkards, and weep, And howl all drinking wine, because of the juice, For it had been cut off from your mouth.
\v 6 For a nation had come up on my land, Strong, and there is no number, Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it had the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
\v 7 It had made my vine become a desolation, And my fig-tree become a chip, It had made it thoroughly bare, and had cast down, Made white have been its branches.
\v 8 Wail, as a virgin girdeth with sackcloth, For the husband of her youth.
\v 9 Cut off had been present and libation from the house of Yahweh, Mourned have the priests, ministrants of Yahweh.
\v 10 Spoiled is the field, mourned had the ground, For spoiled is the corn, Dried up had been new wine, languish did oil.
\v 11 Be ashamed, you husbandmen, Howl, vine-dressers, for wheat and for barley, For perished had the harvest of the field.
\v 12 The vine had been dried up, And the fig-tree did languish, Pomegranate, also palm, and apple-tree, All trees of the field have withered, For dried up had been joy from the sons of men.
\v 13 Gird, and lament, you priests, Howl, you ministrants of the altar, Come in, lodge in sackcloth, ministrants of my God, For withheld from the house of your God had been present and libation.
\v 14 Sanctify a fast, proclaim a restraint, Gather the elders — all the inhabitants of the land, Into the house of Yahweh your God,
\v 15 And cry unto Yahweh, 'Alas for the day! For near is a day of Yahweh, And as destruction from the mighty it came.
\v 16 Is not before our eyes food cut off? From the house of our God joy and rejoicing?
\v 17 Rotted have scattered things under their clods, Desolated have been storehouses, Broken down have been granaries, For withered had the corn.
\v 18 How have cattle sighed! Perplexed have been droves of oxen, For there is no pasture for them, Also droves of sheep have been desolated.
\v 19 Unto Thee, O Yahweh, I do call, For fire had consumed comely places of a wilderness, And a flame had set on fire all trees of the field.
\v 20 Also the cattle of the field long for Thee, For dried up have been streams of water, And fire had consumed comely places of a wilderness!'
\c 2
\v 1 Blow you a trumpet in Zion, And shout you in My holy hill, Tremble do all inhabitants of the earth, For coming is the day of Yahweh, for it is near!
\v 2 A day of darkness and thick darkness, A day of cloud and thick darkness, As darkness spread on the mountains, A people numerous and mighty, Like it there had not been from of old, And after it there is not again — till the years of generation and generation.
\v 3 Before it consumed had fire, And after it burn did a flame, As the garden of Eden is the land before it, And after it a wilderness — a desolation! And also an escape there had not been to it,
\v 4 As the appearance of horses is its appearance, And as horsemen, so they run.
\v 5 As the noise of chariots, on the tops of the mountains they skip, As the noise of a flame of fire devouring stubble, As a mighty people set in array for battle.
\v 6 From its face pained are peoples, All faces have gathered paleness.
\v 7 As mighty ones they run, As men of war they go up a wall, And each in his own ways they do go, And they embarrass not their paths.
\v 8 And each his brother they press not, Each in his way they go on, If by the missile they fall, they are not cut off.
\v 9 In the city they run to and fro, On the wall they run, Into houses they go up by the windows, They go in as a thief.
\v 10 At their face trembled had the earth, Shaken have the heavens, Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up their shining.
\v 11 And Yahweh had given forth His voice before His force, For very great is His camp, For mighty is the doer of His word, For great is the day of Yahweh — very fearful, And who did bear it?
\v 12 And also now — an affirmation of Yahweh, Turn you back unto Me with all your heart, And with fasting, and with weeping, And with lamentation.
\v 13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, And turn back unto Yahweh your God, For gracious and merciful is He, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness, And He had repented concerning the evil.
\v 14 Who knoweth — He did turn back, Yea — He had repented, And He had left behind Him a blessing, A present and libation of Yahweh your God?
\v 15 Blow you a trumpet in Zion, Sanctify a fast — proclaim a restraint.
\v 16 Gather the people, sanctify an assembly, Assemble the aged, Gather infants and sucklings of the breasts, Go out let a bridegroom from his inner chamber, And a bride out of her closet.
\v 17 Between the porch and the altar weep let the priests, ministrants of Yahweh, And let them say: 'Have pity, O Yahweh, on Your people, And give not Your inheritance to reproach, To the ruling over them of nations, Why do they say among peoples, Where is their God?'
\v 18 And let Yahweh be zealous for His land, And have pity on His people.
\v 19 Let Yahweh answer and say to His people, 'Lo, I am sending to you the corn, And the new wine, and the oil, And you have been satisfied with it, And I make you no more a reproach among nations,
\v 20 And the northern I put far off from you, And have driven him unto a land dry and desolate, With his face unto the eastern sea, And his rear unto the western sea, And come up had his stink, And come up did his stench, For he had exerted himself to work.
\v 21 Do not fear, O land! joy and rejoice, For Yahweh had exerted Himself to work.
\v 22 Do not fear, O cattle of the field! For sprung forth have pastures of a wilderness, For the tree had borne its fruit, Fig-tree and vine have given their strength!
\v 23 And you sons of Zion, joy and rejoice, In Yahweh your God, For He had given to you the Teacher for righteousness, And caused to come down to you a shower, Sprinkling and gathered — in the beginning.
\v 24 And full have been the floors with pure corn, And overflown have the presses with new wine and oil.
\v 25 And I have recompensed to you the years That consume did the locust, the cankerworm, And the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, My great force that I did send against you.
\v 26 And you have eaten, eating and being satisfied, And have praised the name of Yahweh your God, Who had dealt with you wonderfully, And not ashamed are My people to the age.
\v 27 And you have known that in the middle of Israel am I, And I am Yahweh your God, and there is none else, And not ashamed are My people to the age.
\v 28 And it had come to pass afterwards, I do pour out My Spirit on all flesh, And prophesied have your sons and your daughters, Your old men do dream dreams, Your young men do see visions.
\v 29 And also on the men-servants, and on the maid-servants, In those days I do pour out My Spirit.
\v 30 And I have given wonders in the heavens, and in the earth, Blood and fire, and columns of smoke.
\v 31 The sun is turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, Before the coming of the day of Yahweh, The great and the fearful.
\v 32 And it had come to pass, Every one who called in the name of Yahweh is delivered, For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there is an escape, As Yahweh had said, And among the remnants whom Yahweh is calling!

\v 1 For behold, in those days, and in that time, When I turn back to the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
\v 2 Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance — Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they have apportioned.
\v 3 And for My people they do cast a lot, And they give the young man for an harlot, And the young woman have sold for wine, That they may drink.
\v 4 And also, what are you to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, And all circuits of Philistia? Recompence are you rendering unto Me? And if you are giving recompence to Me, Swiftly, hastily, I turn back your recompence on your head.
\v 5 In that My silver and My gold you took, And My desirable things that are good, Ye have brought in to your temples.
\v 6 And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to the sons of Javan, To put them far off from their border.
\v 7 Lo, I am stirring them up out of the place Whither you have sold them, And I have turned back your recompence on your head,
\v 8 And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the sons of Judah, And they have sold them to Shabeans, Unto a nation far off, for Yahweh had spoken.
\v 9 Proclaim you this among nations, Sanctify a war, stir up the mighty ones, Come nigh, come up, let all the men of war.
\v 10 Beat your ploughshares to swords, And your pruning-hooks to javelins, Let the weak say, 'I am mighty.'
\v 11 Haste, and come in, all you nations round, And be gathered together, Thither cause to come down, O Yahweh, Your mighty ones.
\v 12 Wake and come up let the nations unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I sit to judge all the nations around.
\v 13 Send you forth a sickle, For ripened had harvest, Come in, come down, for filled had been the press, Overflowed had wine-presses, For great is their wickedness.
\v 14 Multitudes, multitudes are in the valley of decision, For near is the day of Yahweh in the valley of decision.
\v 15 Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up their shining.
\v 16 And Yahweh from Zion did roar, And from Jerusalem gave forth His voice, And shaken have the heavens and earth, And Yahweh is a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to sons of Israel.
\v 17 And you have known that I am Yahweh your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain, And Jerusalem had been holy, And strangers do not pass over into it again.
\v 18 And it had come to pass, in that day, Drop down do the mountains juice, And the hills do flow with milk, And all streams of Judah do go with water, And a fountain from the house of Yahweh went forth, And had watered the valley of Shittim.
\v 19 Egypt a desolation became, And Edom a desolation, a wilderness, became, For violence to sons of Judah, Whose innocent blood they shed in their land.
\v 20 And Judah to the age did dwell, And Jerusalem to generation and generation.
\v 21 And I have declared their blood innocent, That I did not declare innocent, And Yahweh is dwelling in Zion!
