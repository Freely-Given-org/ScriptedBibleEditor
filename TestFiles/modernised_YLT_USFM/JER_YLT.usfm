\v 1 Words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who are in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin,
\v 2 unto whom the word of Yahweh had been in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign,
\v 3 and it is in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, till the completion of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, till the removal of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
\v 4 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 5 'Before I form you in the belly, I have known you; and before you comest forth from the womb I have separated you, a prophet to nations I have made you.'
\v 6 And I say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, I have not known — to speak, for I am a youth.'
\v 7 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Do not say, I am a youth, for to all to whom I send you you goest, and all that I command you you speakest.
\v 8 Be not afraid of their faces, for with you am I to deliver you, — an affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 9 And Yahweh putteth forth His hand, and striketh against my mouth, and Yahweh said unto me, 'Lo, I have put my words in your mouth.
\v 10 See, I have charged you this day concerning the nations, and concerning the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.'
\v 11 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying, 'What are you seeing, Jeremiah?' And I say, 'A rod of an almond tree I am seeing.'
\v 12 And Yahweh said unto me, 'You hast well seen: for I am watching over My word to do it.'
\v 13 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me a second time, saying, 'What are you seeing?' And I say, 'A blown pot I am seeing, and its face is from the north.'
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto me, 'From the north is the evil loosed against all inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For, behold, I am calling for all families of the kingdoms of the north, — an affirmation of Yahweh — and they have come, and put each his throne at the opening of the gates of Jerusalem, and by its walls round about, and by all cities of Judah.
\v 16 And I have spoken My judgments with them concerning all their evil, in that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, and bow themselves to the works of their own hands.
\v 17 'And you, you will gird up your loins, and hast arisen, and spoken unto them all that I command you: be not frightened because of them, lest I affright you before them.
\v 18 And I, behold, I have given you this day for a fenced city, and for an iron pillar, and for brazen walls over all the land, to the kings of Judah, to its heads, to its priests, and to the people of the land;
\v 19 and they have fought against you, and they prevail not against you; for with you am I, — an affirmation of Yahweh — to deliver you.
\c 2
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying,
\v 2 'Go, and you hast called in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said Yahweh: I have remembered for you The kindness of your youth, the love of yours espousals, Your going after Me in a wilderness, in a land not sown.
\v 3 Holy is Israel to Yahweh, The first-fruit of His increase, All consuming him are guilty, Evil came in unto them, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 4 Hear a word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, And all you families of the house of Israel.
\v 5 Thus said Yahweh: What — have your fathers found in Me perversity, That they have gone far off from Me, And go after the vanity, and become vain,
\v 6 And have not said, Where is Yahweh, Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who leadeth us in a wilderness, In a land of deserts and pits, In a dry land, and of death-shade, In a land — none had passed through it, Nor dwelt had man there?'
\v 7 Yea, I bring you in to a land of fruitful fields, To eat its fruit and its goodness, And you come in and defile My land, And Mine inheritance have made an abomination.
\v 8 The priests have not said, 'Where is Yahweh?' And those handling the law have not known Me. And the shepherds transgressed against Me, And the prophets have prophesied by Baal, And after those who profit not have gone.
\v 9 Therefore, yet I plead with you, An affirmation of Yahweh, And with your sons' sons I plead.
\v 10 For, pass to the isles of Chittim, and see, And to Kedar send, and consider well, And see if there had been like this:
\v 11 Hath a nation changed gods? (And they are no gods!) And My people had changed its honour For that which did not profit.
\v 12 Be astonished, you heavens, at this, Yea, be frightened, be greatly wasted, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 13 For two evils had My people done, Me they have forsaken, a fountain of living waters, To hew out for themselves wells — broken wells, That contain not the waters.
\v 14 A servant is Israel? Is he a child of the house? Wherefore had he been for a prey?
\v 15 Against him roar do young lions, They have given forth their voice, And make his land become a desolation, His cities have been burnt without inhabitant.
\v 16 Also sons of Noph and Tahapanes Consume you — the crown of the head!
\v 17 Dost you not do this to thyself? By your forsaking Yahweh your God, At the time He is leading you in the way?
\v 18 And now, what — to you in the way of Egypt, To drink the waters of Sihor? And what — to you in the way of Asshur, To drink the waters of the River?
\v 19 Instruct you did your wickedness, And your backslidings reprove you, Know and see that an evil and a bitter thing Is your forsaking Yahweh your God, And My fear not being on you, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 20 For from of old you hast broken your yoke, Drawn away your bands, and sayest, 'I do not serve,' For, on every high height, and under every green tree, You are wandering — a harlot.
\v 21 And I planted you a choice vine, wholly a true seed, And how hast you been turned to Me, To the degenerate shoots of a strange vine?
\v 22 But though you will wash with nitre, And will multiply to thyself soap, Marked is yours iniquity before Me, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh.
\v 23 How sayest you, 'I have not been defiled, After the Baalim I have not gone?' See your way in a valley, know what you hast done, A swift dromedary winding her ways,
\v 24 A wild ass accustomed to a wilderness, In the desire of her soul she had swallowed up wind, Her meeting — who did turn her back? None seeking her do weary themselves, In her month they find her.
\v 25 Withhold your foot from being unshod, And your throat from thirst, And you sayest, 'It is incurable, No, for I have loved strangers, and after them I go.'
\v 26 As the shame of a thief when he is found, So put to shame have been the house of Israel, They, their kings, their heads, And their priests, and their prophets,
\v 27 Saying to wood, 'My father are you!' And to a stone, 'You hast brought me forth,' For they turned unto me the back and not the face, And in the time of their vexation, They say, 'Arise You, and save us.'
\v 28 And where are your gods, that you hast made to thyself? Let them arise, if they may save you, In the time of your vexation, For — the number of your cities have been your gods, O Judah,
\v 29 Why do you strive with Me? All of you have transgressed against Me, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 30 In vain I have smitten your sons, Instruction they have not accepted, Devoured had your sword your prophets, As a destroying lion.
\v 31 O generation, see you the word of Yahweh: A wilderness have I been to Israel? A land of thick darkness? Wherefore have My people said, 'We mourned, We come not in again unto Thee.'
\v 32 Doth a virgin forget her ornaments? A bride her bands? And My people have forgotten Me days without number.
\v 33 What — will you make pleasing your ways to seek love? Therefore even the wicked you hast taught your ways.
\v 34 Also in your skirts had been found the blood of innocent needy souls, Not by digging have I found them, but upon all these.
\v 35 And you sayest, 'Because I have been innocent, Surely turned back had His anger from me?' Lo, I have been judged with you, Because of your saying, 'I have not sinned.'
\v 36 What? you are very vile to repeat your way, Even of Egypt you are ashamed, As you hast been ashamed of Asshur,
\v 37 Also from this you goest out, And your hands on your head, For Yahweh had kicked at your confidences, And you will not give prosperity to them!
\c 3
\v 1 Saying, 'Lo, one sent away his wife, And she had gone from him, And she had been to another man, Doth he turn back unto her again? Greatly defiled is not that land? And you hast committed whoredom with many lovers, And turn again to Me, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 2 Lift yours eyes to the high places, and see, Where hast you not been lain with? On the ways you hast sat for them, As an Arab in a wilderness, And you defilest the land, By your fornications, and by your wickedness.
\v 3 And withheld are showers, and gathered rain had not been. The forehead of a whorish woman you hast, You hast refused to be ashamed.
\v 4 Hast you not henceforth called to Me, 'My father, You are the leader of my youth?
\v 5 Doth He keep to the age? watch for ever?' Lo, these things you hast spoken, And you will the evil things, and prevailest.
\v 6 And Yahweh said unto me, in the days of Josiah the king, 'Hast you seen that which backsliding Israel had done? She is going on every high mountain, and unto the place of every green tree, and committeth fornication there.
\v 7 And I say, after her doing all these, Unto Me you will turn back, and she had not turned back, and see it did her treacherous sister Judah.
\v 8 And I see when (for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery) I have sent her away, and I give the bill of her divorce unto her, that treacherous Judah her sister had not feared, and went and committeth fornication — she also.
\v 9 And it had come to pass, from the vileness of her fornication, that the land is defiled, and she committeth fornication with stone and with wood.
\v 10 And even in all this her treacherous sister Judah had not turned back unto Me with all her heart, but with falsehood, an affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto me: 'Justified herself had backsliding Israel, More than treacherous Judah.
\v 12 Go, and you hast proclaimed these words toward the north, and hast said, Turn back, O backsliding Israel, An affirmation of Yahweh! I cause not Mine anger to fall upon you, For I am kind, an affirmation of Yahweh, I watch not to the age.
\v 13 Only, know yours iniquity, For against Yahweh your God you hast transgressed, And you will scatter your ways to strangers, Under every green tree, And to My voice you hast not hearkened, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 14 Turn back, O backsliding sons, An affirmation of Yahweh. For I have ruled over you, And taken you one of a city, and two of a family, And have brought you to Zion,
\v 15 And I have given to you shepherds According to Mine own heart, And they have fed you with knowledge and understanding.
\v 16 And it had come to pass, when you are multiplied, And have been fruitful in the land, In those days — an affirmation of Yahweh, They say not any more, 'The ark of the covenant of Yahweh,' Nor did it go up on the heart, Nor do they remember concerning it, Nor do they inspect, nor is it made again.
\v 17 At that time they cry to Jerusalem, 'O throne of Yahweh,' And gathered unto her had been all the nations, For the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, Nor do they go any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
\v 18 In those days do the house of Judah Go unto the house of Israel, And they come together from the land of the south, unto the land That I caused your fathers to inherit.
\v 19 And I have said, How do I put you among the sons, And give to you a desirable land, A beauteous inheritance of the hosts of nations, And I say, My father — you do call to Me, And from after Me you do not turn back.
\v 20 But — a woman had deceived her friend, So you have dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 21 A voice on high places is heard — weeping, Supplications of the sons of Israel, For they have made perverse their way, They have forgotten Yahweh their God.
\v 22 Turn back, O backsliding sons, I cause your backslidings to cease. — Behold us, we have come to Thee, For You are Yahweh our God.
\v 23 Surely in vain from the heights, The multitude of mountains — Surely in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.
\v 24 And the shameful thing had devoured The labour of our fathers from our youth, Their flock and their herd, Their sons and their daughters.
\v 25 We have lain down in our shame, and cover us did our confusion, For against Yahweh our God we have sinned, We, and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, Nor have we hearkened to the voice of Yahweh our God!
\c 4
\v 1 If you will turn back, O Israel, An affirmation of Yahweh, unto Me turn back, And if you will turn aside Thine abominations from My face, Then you will not bemoan.
\v 2 And you hast sworn — Yahweh lived, In truth, in judgment, and in righteousness, And blessed themselves in Him have nations, And in Him they boast themselves.
\v 3 For thus said Yahweh, To the man of Judah, and to Jerusalem: Till for yourselves tillage, And do not sow unto the thorns.
\v 4 Be circumcised to Yahweh, And turn aside the foreskins of your heart, O man of Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, Lest My fury go out as fire, and had burned, And there is none quenching, Because of the evil of your doings.
\v 5 Declare in Judah, and in Jerusalem sound, And say you, 'Blow a trumpet in the land,' Call you fully, and say you: 'Be gathered, and we go in to the fenced city.'
\v 6 Lift up an ensign Zionward, Strengthen yourselves, stand not still, For evil I am bringing in from the north, And a great destruction.
\v 7 Gone up had a lion from his thicket, And a destroyer of nations had journeyed, He had come forth from his place To make your land become a desolation, Your cities are laid waste, without inhabitant.
\v 8 For this, gird on sackcloth, lament and howl, For the fierce anger of Yahweh had not turned back from us.
\v 9 And it had come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh: 'Perish did the heart of the king, And the heart of the princes, And astonished have been the priests, And the prophets do wonder.'
\v 10 And I say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, Surely you hast entirely forgotten this people and Jerusalem, saying, Peace is for you, And struck had a sword unto the soul!'
\v 11 At that time it is said of this people, And of Jerusalem: 'A dry wind of high places in the wilderness,' The way of the daughter of My people, (Not for winnowing, nor for cleansing,)
\v 12 A full wind from these did come for Me, Now, also, I speak judgments with them.
\v 13 Lo, as clouds he came up, And as a hurricane his chariots, Lighter than eagles have been his horses, Woe to us, for we have been spoiled.
\v 14 Wash from evil your heart, O Jerusalem, That you may be saved, Till when will you lodge in your heart Youghts of your strength?
\v 15 For a voice is declaring from Dan, And sounding sorrow from mount Ephraim.
\v 16 Make you mention to the nations, Lo, sound you to Jerusalem: 'Besiegers are coming from the land afar off, And they give forth against cities of Judah their voice.
\v 17 As the keepers of a field They have been against her round about, For with Me she had been rebellious, An affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 18 Your way and your doings have done these to you, This is your vexation, for it is bitter, For it had struck unto your heart.
\v 19 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at the walls of my heart, Make a noise for me did My heart, I am not silent, For the voice of a trumpet I have heard, O my soul — a shout of battle!
\v 20 Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, For spoiled had been all the land, Suddenly spoiled have been my tents, In a moment — my curtains.
\v 21 Till when do I see an ensign? Do I hear the voice of a trumpet?
\v 22 For my people are foolish, me they have not known, Foolish sons are they, yea, they are not intelligent, Wise are they to do evil, And to do good they have not known.
\v 23 I looked to the land, and behold, waste and void, And unto the heavens, and their light is not.
\v 24 I have looked to the mountains, And behold, they are trembling. And all the hills moved themselves lightly.
\v 25 I have looked, and behold, man is not, And all fowls of the heavens have fled.
\v 26 I have looked, and behold, The fruitful place is a wilderness, And all its cities have been broken down, Because of Yahweh, Because of the fierceness of His anger.
\v 27 For thus said Yahweh: All the land is a desolation, but a completion I make not.
\v 28 For this did the land mourn, And black have been the heavens above, because I have spoken — I have purposed, And I have not repented, Nor do I turn back from it.
\v 29 From the voice of the horseman, And of him shooting with the bow, all the city is fleeing, They have come into thickets, And on cliffs they have gone up, All the city is forsaken, And there is no one dwelling in them.
\v 30 And you, O spoiled one, what will you? For you puttest on scarlet, For you adornest thyself with ornaments of gold. For you rendest with pain yours eyes, In vain you will make thyself fair, Kicked against you have doting ones, Your life they do seek.
\v 31 For a voice as of a sick woman I have heard, Distress, as of one bringing forth a first-born, The voice of the daughter of Zion, She bewaileth herself, she spreadeth out her hands, 'Woe to me now, for weary is my soul of slayers!'
\c 5
\v 1 Go to and fro in streets of Jerusalem, And see, I pray you, and know, And seek in her broad places, if you find a man, If there be one doing judgment, seeking stedfastness — Then am I propitious to her.
\v 2 And if they say, 'Yahweh lived,' Surely to a falsehood they swear.
\v 3 Yahweh, Thine eyes, are they not on stedfastness? You hast smitten them, and they have not grieved, You hast consumed them, They have refused to receive instruction, They made their faces harder than a rock, They have refused to turn back.
\v 4 And I — I said, 'Surely these are poor, They have been foolish, For they have not known the way of Yahweh, The judgment of their God.
\v 5 I get me to the great, and I speak with them, For they have known the way of Yahweh, The judgment of their God.' Surely they together have broken the yoke, They have drawn away the bands.
\v 6 Therefore smitten them had a lion out of the forest, A wolf of the deserts did spoil them, A leopard is watching over their cities, Every one who is going out of them is torn, For many have been their transgressions, Mighty have been their backslidings.
\v 7 For this I am not propitious to you, Your sons have forsaken Me, And are satisfied by that which is not god, I satisfy them, and they commit adultery, And at the house of a harlot They gather themselves together.
\v 8 Fed horses — they have been early risers, Each to the wife of his neighbour they neigh.
\v 9 For these do I not lay a charge? An affirmation of Yahweh, And on a nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?
\v 10 Go you up on her walls, and destroy, And a completion make not, Turn aside her branches, for they are not Yahweh's,
\v 11 For dealt treacherously against Me have the house of Israel, And the house of Judah, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 12 They have lied against Yahweh, And they say, 'It is not He, Nor come in against us did evil, Yea, sword and famine we do not see.
\v 13 And the prophets become wind, And the word is not in them,' — thus it is done by them.
\v 14 Therefore, thus said Yahweh, God of Hosts, Because of your speaking this word, Lo, I am making My words in your mouth become fire, And this people wood, and it had devoured them.
\v 15 Lo, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, an affirmation of Yahweh, A nation — strong it is, a nation — from of old it is, A nation — you knowest not its tongue, Nor understandest what it spoke.
\v 16 Its quiver is as an open sepulchre, All of them — mighty ones.
\v 17 And it had consumed your harvest and your bread, They consume your sons, and your daughters, It consumeth your flock, and your herd, It consumeth your vine, and your fig-tree, It made poor your fenced cities, In which you are trusting — by the sword.
\v 18 And even in those days, an affirmation of Yahweh, I do not make you a completion.
\v 19 And it had come to pass, when you say, 'For what had Yahweh our God done to us all these?' That you hast said unto them, 'As you have forsaken Me, And serve the gods of a foreigner in your land, So do you serve strangers in a land not yours.
\v 20 Declare you this in the house of Jacob, And sound you it in Judah, saying,
\v 21 Hear you, I pray you, this, O people, foolish and without heart, Eyes they have, and they see not, Ears they have, and they hear not.
\v 22 Me do you not fear, an affirmation of Yahweh? From My presence are you not pained? Who had made sand the border of the sea, A limit age-during, and it passeth not over it, They shake themselves, and they are not able, Yea, sounded have its billows, and they pass not over.
\v 23 And this people had an apostate and rebellious heart, They have turned aside, and they go on.
\v 24 And they have not said in their heart, 'Let us fear, we pray you, Yahweh our God, who is giving rain, The sprinkling and the gathered, in its season, The appointed weeks of harvest He keepeth for us.'
\v 25 Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have kept the good from you.
\v 26 For the wicked have been found among My people. It looketh about the covering of snares, They have set up a trap — men they capture.
\v 27 As a cage full of fowls, So their houses are full of deceit, Therefore they have been great, and are rich.
\v 28 They have been fat, they have shone, Yea, they have overpassed the acts of the evil, Judgment they have not judged, The judgment of the fatherless — and they prosper, And the judgment of the needy they have not judged.
\v 29 For these do not I inspect, an affirmation of Yahweh, On a nation such as this, Doth not My soul avenge itself?
\v 30 An astonishing and horrible thing had been in the land.
\v 31 The prophets have prophesied falsely, And the priests bear rule by their means, And My people have loved it so, And what do they at its latter end?
\c 6
\v 1 Strengthen yourselves, sons of Benjamin, From the middle of Jerusalem, And in Tekoa blow you a trumpet, And over Beth-Haccerem lift you up a flame, For evil had been seen from the north, And great destruction.
\v 2 The comely and the delicate one I have cut off, The daughter of Zion.
\v 3 Unto her come do shepherds and their droves, They have stricken tents by her round about, They have fed each in his own station.
\v 4 Sanctify you against her the battle, Rise, and we go up at noon. Woe to us, for turned had the day, For stretched out are the shades of evening,
\v 5 'Rise, and we go up by night, And we destroy her palaces.'
\v 6 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Cut down her wood, And pour out against Jerusalem a mount, She is the city to be inspected, Wholly — she is oppression in her middle.
\v 7 As the digging of a well, is for its waters, So she had digged for her wickedness, Violence and spoil is heard in her, Before My face continually are sickness and smiting.
\v 8 Be instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest My soul be alienated from you, Lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.
\v 9 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: They surely glean, as a vine, the remnant of Israel, Put back your hand, as a gatherer to the baskets.
\v 10 To whom do I speak, and testify, and they hear? Lo, their ear is uncircumcised, And they are not able to attend. Lo, a word of Yahweh had been to them for a reproach, They delight not in it.
\v 11 And with the fury of Yahweh I have been filled, (I have been weary of containing,) To pour it on the suckling in the street, And on the assembly of youths together, For even husband with wife are captured, An elder with one full of days,
\v 12 And their houses have been turned to others, Fields and wives together, For I stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 13 For from their least unto their greatest, Every one is gaining dishonest gain, And from prophet even unto priest, Every one is dealing falsely,
\v 14 And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people slightly, Saying, 'Peace, peace!' and there is no peace.
\v 15 They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are not at all ashamed, Yea, blushing they have not known, Therefore they do fall among those falling, In the time I have inspected them, They stumble, said Yahweh.
\v 16 Thus said Yahweh: Stand you by the ways and see, and ask for paths of old, Where is this — the good way? and go you in it, And find rest for yourselves. And they say, 'We do not go.'
\v 17 And I have raised up for you watchmen, Attend you to the voice of the trumpet. And they say, 'We do not attend.'
\v 18 Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O company, That which is upon them.
\v 19 Hear, O earth, behold, I am bringing evil on this people, The fruit of their devices, For to My words they gave no attention, And My law — they kick against it.
\v 20 Why is this to Me? frankincense from Sheba came, And the sweet cane from a land afar off, Your burnt-offerings are not for acceptance, And your sacrifices have not been sweet to Me.
\v 21 Therefore thus said Yahweh: Lo, I do give to this people stumbling blocks, And stumbled against them have fathers and sons together, The neighbour and his friend do perish.
\v 22 Thus said Yahweh: Lo, a people had come from a north country, And a great nation is stirred up from the sides of the earth.
\v 23 Bow and javelin they take hold of, Fierce it is, and they have no mercy, Their voice as a sea did sound, And on horses they ride, set in array as a man of war, Against you, O daughter of Zion.
\v 24 'We have heard its sound, feeble have been our hands, Distress had seized us, pain as of a travailing woman.
\v 25 Go not forth to the field, And in the way walk not, For a sword had the enemy, fear is round about.
\v 26 O daughter of My people, Gird on sackcloth, and roll thyself in ashes, The mourning of an only one make for you, A lamentation most bitter, For suddenly come did the spoiler against us.
\v 27 A watch-tower I have given you, Among My people a fortress, And you knowest, and hast tried their way.
\v 28 All of them are turned aside by apostates, Walking slanderously — brass and iron, All of them are corrupters.
\v 29 The bellows have been burnt, By fire had the lead been consumed, In vain had a refiner refined, And the wicked have not been drawn away.
\v 30 'Silver rejected,' they have called to them, For Yahweh had kicked against them!
\c 7
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Stand in the gate of the house of Yahweh, and you hast proclaimed there this word, and hast said, Hear a word of Yahweh, all you of Judah, who are coming in at these gates, to bow before Yahweh:
\v 3 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Amend your ways, and your doings, And I cause you to dwell in this place.
\v 4 Do not trust for yourselves Unto the words of falsehood, saying, The temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, The temple of Yahweh are they!
\v 5 For, if you do thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, If you do judgment thoroughly Between a man and his neighbour,
\v 6 Sojourner, fatherless, and widow, you oppress not, And innocent blood do not shed in this place, And after other gods do not walk, for evil to yourselves,
\v 7 Then I have caused you to dwell in this place, In the land that I gave to your fathers, From age even unto age.
\v 8 Lo, you are trusting for yourselves On the words of falsehood, so as not to profit.
\v 9 Stealing, murdering, and committing adultery, And swearing to falsehood, and giving perfume to Baal, And going after other gods whom you knew not.
\v 10 And you have come in and stood before Me, In this house on which My name is called, And have said, 'We have been delivered,' In order to do all these abominations.
\v 11 A den of burglars had this house, On which My name is called, been in your eyes? Even I, behold, I have seen, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 12 But go you, I pray you, Unto My place that is in Shiloh, Where I caused My name to dwell at first, And see that which I have done to it, For the wickedness of My people Israel.
\v 13 And now, because of your doing all these works, An affirmation of Yahweh, And I speak unto you, rising early and speaking, And you have not hearkened, And I call you, and you have not answered,
\v 14 I also to the house on which My name is called, In which you are trusting, And to the place that I gave to you, and to your fathers, Have done, as I have done to Shiloh.
\v 15 And I have cast you from before My face, As I have cast out all your brethren, The whole seed of Ephraim.
\v 16 And you will not pray for this people, Nor lift up for them crying and prayer, Nor intercede with Me, for I hear you not.
\v 17 Art you not seeing what they are doing In cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem?
\v 18 The sons are gathering wood, And the fathers are causing the fire to burn, And the women are kneading dough, To make cakes to the queen of the heavens, And to pour out libations to other gods, So as to provoke Me to anger.
\v 19 Me are they provoking to anger? an affirmation of Yahweh, Is it not themselves, For the shame of their own faces?
\v 20 Therefore, thus said the Lord Yahweh, Lo, Mine anger and My fury is poured out on this place, On man, and beast, and on tree of the field, And on fruit of the ground, And it had burned, and it is not quenched.
\v 21 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Your burnt-offerings add to your sacrifices, And eat you flesh.
\v 22 For I did not speak with your fathers, Nor did I command them in the day of My bringing them out of the land of Egypt, Concerning the matters of burnt-offering and sacrifice,
\v 23 But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to My voice, And I have been to you for God, And you — you are to Me for a people, And have walked in all the way that I command you, So that it is well for you.
\v 24 And they have not hearkened, nor inclined their ear, And they walk in the counsels, In the stubbornness, of their evil heart, And are for backward, and not for forward.
\v 25 Even from the day when your fathers Went out of the land of Egypt till this day, I send to you all my servants the prophets, Daily rising early and sending,
\v 26 And they have not hearkened unto Me, Nor inclined their ear, and harden their neck, They have done evil above their fathers.
\v 27 And you hast spoken unto them all these words, And they do not hearken to you, And you hast called unto them, And they do not answer you.
\v 28 And you hast said unto them: This is the nation that had not hearkened, To the voice of Yahweh its God, Nor have they accepted instruction, Perished had stedfastness, Yea, it had been cut off from their mouth.
\v 29 Cut off your crown, and cast it away, And lift up on high places lamentation, For Yahweh had rejected, And He leaveth the generation of His wrath.
\v 30 For the sons of Judah Have done the evil thing in Mine eyes, An affirmation of Yahweh, They have set their abominations in the house On which My name is called — to defile it,
\v 31 And have built the high places of Tophet, That are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, To burn their sons and their daughters with fire, Which I did not command, Nor did it come up on My heart.
\v 32 Therefore, behold, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And it is not said any more, 'The Tophet,' And 'Valley of the son of Hinnom,' But 'Valley of the slaughter,' And they have buried in Tophet — without place.
\v 33 And the carcase of this people had been for food To a fowl of the heavens, and to a beast of the earth, And there is none troubling.
\v 34 And I have caused to cease from cities of Judah, And from streets of Jerusalem, The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, Voice of bridegroom, and voice of bride, For the land did become a desolation!
\c 8
\v 1 At that time, an affirmation of Yahweh, They bring the bones of the kings of Judah, And the bones of its princes, And the bones of the priests, And the bones of the prophets, And the bones of inhabitants of Jerusalem, Out of their graves,
\v 2 And have spread them to sun, and to moon, And to all the host of the heavens, that they have loved, And that they have served, And that they have walked after, And that they have sought, And to which they have bowed themselves, They are not gathered, nor buried, They are for dung on the face of the ground.
\v 3 And chosen is death rather than life By all the remnant who are left of this evil family, In all the remaining places, where I have driven them, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 4 And you hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh, Do they fall, and not rise? Doth he turn back, and not return?
\v 5 Wherefore had this people of Jerusalem Turned back — a perpetual backsliding? They have kept hold on deceit, They have refused to turn back.
\v 6 I have given attention, yea, I hearken, They do not speak right, No man had repented of his wickedness, Saying, What have I done? Every one had turned to his courses, As a horse is rushing into battle.
\v 7 Even a stork in the heavens had known her seasons, And turtle, and swallow, and crane, Have watched the time of their coming, And — My people have not known the judgment of Yahweh.
\v 8 How do you say, We are wise, And the law of Yahweh is with us? Surely, behold, falsely it had wrought, The false pen of scribes.
\v 9 Ashamed have been the wise, They have been frightened, and are captured, Lo, against a word of Yahweh they kicked, And the wisdom of what — have they?
\v 10 Therefore, I give their wives to others, Their fields to dispossessors, For from the least even unto the greatest, Every one is gaining dishonest gain, From prophet even unto priest, every one is dealing falsely.
\v 11 And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people slightly, Saying, Peace, peace! and there is no peace.
\v 12 They were ashamed when they did abomination! Yea, they are not at all ashamed, And blushing they have not known, Therefore, they do fall among falling ones, In the time of their inspection they stumble, said Yahweh.
\v 13 I utterly consume them, an affirmation of Yahweh, There are no grapes in the vine, Yea, there are no figs in the fig-tree, And the leaf had faded, And the strength they have passeth from them.
\v 14 Wherefore are we sitting still? Be gathered, and we go in to the fenced cities, And we are silent there, For Yahweh our God had made us silent, Yea, He caused us to drink water of gall, For we have sinned against Yahweh.
\v 15 Looking for peace — and there is no good, For a time of healing, and behold, terror.
\v 16 From Dan had been heard the snorting of his horses, From the voice of the neighings of his mighty ones, Trembled had all the land, And they come in and consume the land and its fulness, The city and the inhabitants in it.
\v 17 For, behold, I am sending among you serpents, Vipers that have no charmer, And they have bitten you, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 18 My refreshing for me is sorrow, For me my heart is sick.
\v 19 Lo, the voice of a cry of the daughter of my people from a land afar off, Is Yahweh not in Zion? is her king not in her? Wherefore have they provoked Me with their graven images, With the vanities of a foreigner?
\v 20 Harvest had passed, summer had ended, And we — we have not been saved.
\v 21 For a breach of the daughter of my people have I been broken, I have been black, astonishment had seized me.
\v 22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? For wherefore had not the health of the daughter of my people gone up?
\c 9
\v 1 Who did make my head waters, And mine eye a fountain of tears? And I weep by day and by night, For the wounded of the daughter of my people.
\v 2 Who did give me in a wilderness A lodging-place of travellers? And I leave my people, and go from them, For all of them are adulterers, An assembly of treacherous ones.
\v 3 And they bend their tongue, their bow is a lie, And not for stedfastness have they been mighty in the land, For from evil unto evil they have gone forth, And Me they have not known, An affirmation of Yahweh!
\v 4 Each of his friend — beware you, And on any brother, do not trust, For every brother did utterly supplant, For every friend slanderously did walk,
\v 5 And each at his friend they mock, And truth they do not speak, They taught their tongue to speak falsehood, To commit iniquity they have laboured.
\v 6 your dwelling is in the middle of deceit, Through deceit they refused to know Me, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 7 Therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Lo, I am refining them, and have tried them, For how do I do because of the daughter of My people?
\v 8 A slaughtering arrow is their tongue, Deceit it had spoken in its mouth, Peace with its neighbour it spoke, And in its heart it laid its ambush,
\v 9 For these things do not I see after them? An affirmation of Yahweh, Against a nation such as this did not My soul avenge itself?
\v 10 For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, And for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, For they have been burnt up without any passing over, Nor have they heard the voice of cattle, From the fowl of the heavens unto the beast they have fled, they have gone.
\v 11 And I make Jerusalem become heaps, A habitation of dragons, And the cities of Judah I make a desolation, Without inhabitant.
\v 12 Who is the wise man? and he understandeth this, And he to whom the mouth of Yahweh spake? And he did declare it, For what had the land perished? It had been burnt up as a wilderness, Without any passing through.
\v 13 And Yahweh said: Because of their forsaking My law that I set before them, And they have not hearkened to My voice nor walked in it,
\v 14 And they walk after the stubbornness of their heart, And after the Baalim, that their fathers taught them,
\v 15 Therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am causing them — this people — to eat wormwood, And I have caused them to drink water of gall,
\v 16 And I have scattered them among nations Which they knew not, they and their fathers, And have sent after them the sword, Till I have consumed them.
\v 17 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Consider you, and call for mourning women, And they come, And to the wise women send, and they come,
\v 18 And they hasten, and lift up for us a wailing. And run down our eyes do tears, And from our eyelids do waters flow.
\v 19 For — a voice of wailing is heard from Zion: How have we been spoiled! We have been greatly ashamed, Because we have forsaken the land, Because they have cast down our tabernacles.
\v 20 But hear, you women, a word of Yahweh, And your ear receiveth a word of His mouth, And teach you your daughters wailing, and each her neighbour lamentation.
\v 21 For death had come up into our windows, It had come into our palaces, To cut off the suckling from without, Young men from the broad places.
\v 22 Speak thus — an affirmation of Yahweh, And fallen had the carcase of man, As dung on the face of the field, And as a handful after the reaper, And there is none gathering.
\v 23 Thus said Yahweh: Let not the wise boast himself in his wisdom, Nor let the mighty boast himself in his might, Let not the rich boast himself in his riches,
\v 24 But — in this let the boaster boast himself, In understanding and knowing Me, For I am Yahweh, doing kindness, Judgment, and righteousness, in the earth, For in these I have delighted, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 25 Lo, days are coming — an affirmation of Yahweh, And I have laid a charge on all circumcised in the foreskin,
\v 26 On Egypt, and on Judah, and on Edom, And on the sons of Ammon, and on Moab, And on all cutting the corner of the beard, Who are dwelling in the wilderness, For all the nations are uncircumcised, And all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart!
\c 10
\v 1 Hear you the word, O house of Israel, That Yahweh had spoken for you.
\v 2 Thus said Yahweh: Unto the way of the nations accustom not yourselves, And by the signs of the heavens be not frightened, For the nations are frightened by them.
\v 3 For the statutes of the peoples are vanity, For a tree from a forest had one cut, Work of the hands of an artificer, with an axe,
\v 4 With silver and with gold they beautify it, With nails and with hammers they fix it, And it did not stumble.
\v 5 As a palm they are stiff, and they speak not, They are surely borne, for they step not, Be not afraid of them, for they do no evil, Yea, also to do good is not in them.
\v 6 Because there is none like Thee, O Yahweh, Great are You, and great Your name in might.
\v 7 Who did not fear Thee, king of the nations? For to Thee it is becoming, For among all the wise of the nations, And in all their kingdom there is none like Thee.
\v 8 And in one they are brutish and foolish, An instruction of vanities is the tree itself.
\v 9 Spread-out silver from Tarshish is brought, And gold from Uphaz, Work of an artisan, and of the hands of a refiner, Blue and purple is their clothing, Work of the skilful — all of them.
\v 10 And Yahweh is a God of truth, He is a living God, and a king age-during, From His wrath shake did the earth, And nations endure not His indignation.
\v 11 Thus do you say to them, The gods Who the heavens and earth have not made, They do perish from the earth, And from under these heavens.
\v 12 The maker of the earth by His power, The establisher of the world by His wisdom, Who, by His understanding, stretched forth the heavens,
\v 13 At the voice He gave forth, A multitude of waters is in the heavens, And He caused vapours to come up from the end of the earth, Lightnings for rain He had made, And brought out wind from His treasures.
\v 14 Brutish is every man by knowledge, Put to shame is every refiner by a graven image, For false is his molten image. And there is no breath in them.
\v 15 Vanity are they, work of erring ones, In the time of their inspection they perish.
\v 16 Not like these is the Portion of Jacob, For framer of all things is He, And Israel is the rod of His inheritance, Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
\v 17 Gather from the land your merchandise, O dweller in the bulwark,
\v 18 For thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time, And have been an adversary to them, So that they are found out.
\v 19 Woe to me for my breaking, Grievious had been my smiting, And I said, Only, this is my sickness, and I bear it.
\v 20 My tent had been spoiled, And all my cords have been broken, My sons have gone out from me, and they are not, There is none stretching out any more my tent, And raising up my curtains.
\v 21 For the shepherds have become brutish, And Yahweh they have not sought, Therefore they have not acted wisely, And all their flock is scattered.
\v 22 A voice of a report, behold, it had come, Even a great shaking from the north country, To make the cities of Judah a desolation, A habitation of dragons.
\v 23 I have known, O Yahweh, that not of man is his way, Not of man the going and establishing of his step.
\v 24 Chastise me, O Yahweh, only in judgment, Not in Thine anger, lest You make me small.
\v 25 Pour out Your fury on the nations that have not known Thee, And on the families that have not called in Your name, For they have eaten up Jacob, Yea, they have eaten him up, yea, they consume him, And his habitation they have made desolate!
\c 11
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying:
\v 2 'Hear you the words of this covenant, and you have spoken unto the men of Judah, and unto the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
\v 3 and you hast said unto them, Thus said Yahweh God of Israel: Cursed is the man who did not obey the words of this covenant,
\v 4 That I commanded your fathers, In the day of My bringing them out from the land of Egypt, Out of the iron furnace, saying, Hearken to My voice, and you have done them, According to all that I command you, And you have been to Me for a people, And I am to you for God,
\v 5 In order to establish the oath that I have sworn to your fathers, To give to them a land flowing with milk and honey, as this day. And I answer and say, 'Amen, O Yahweh.'
\v 6 And Yahweh said unto me, 'Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear you the words of this covenant, And you have done them.
\v 7 For I certainly testified against your fathers, In the day of My bringing them up out of the land of Egypt — till this day, Rising early and testifying, saying, Hearken to My voice,
\v 8 And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, And they walk each in the stubbornness of their evil heart, And I bring on them all the words of this covenant, That I commanded to do, and they did not.'
\v 9 And Yahweh said unto me: 'A conspiracy is found in the men of Judah, And in the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their first fathers, Who refused to hear My words, And they have gone after other gods to serve them, The house of Israel, and the house of Judah, Have made void My covenant, that I made with their fathers.
\v 11 Therefore thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am bringing in unto them evil, That they are not able to go out from, And they have cried unto Me, And I do not hearken unto them.
\v 12 And the cities of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem have gone, And they have cried unto the gods, To whom they are making perfume, And they give no deliverance at all to them, In the time of their vexation.
\v 13 For — the number of your cities have been your gods, O Judah, And — the number of the streets of Jerusalem Ye have placed altars to a shameful thing, Altars to make perfume to Baal.
\v 14 And you, you will not pray for this people, Nor will you lift up for them cry and prayer, For I do not hearken in the time of their calling unto Me for their vexation.
\v 15 What — to My beloved in My house, Her doing wickedness with many, And the holy flesh do pass over from you? When you will evil, then you exultest.
\v 16 'An olive, green, fair, of goodly fruit,' Hath Yahweh called your name, At the noise of a great tumult He had kindled fire against it, And broken have been its thin branches.
\v 17 And Yahweh of Hosts, who is planting you, Hath spoken evil concerning you, For the evil of the house of Israel, and of the house of Judah, That they have done to themselves, To provoke Me to anger, to make perfume to Baal.
\v 18 And, O Yahweh, cause me to know, and I know, Then You hast showed me their doings.
\v 19 And I am as a trained lamb brought to slaughter, And I have not known That against me they have devised devices: We destroy the tree with its food, and cut him off From the land of the living, And his name is not remembered again.
\v 20 And O Yahweh of Hosts, judging righteousness, Trying reins and heart, I do see Your vengeance against them, For unto Thee I have revealed my cause.'
\v 21 Therefore, thus said Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth, who are seeking your life, saying: Do not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, And you will not die by our hands.
\v 22 Therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts: 'Lo, I am seeing after them, The chosen ones die by sword, Their sons and their daughters die by famine,
\v 23 And they have no remnant, For I bring evil unto the men of Anathoth, The year of their inspection!'
\c 12
\v 1 Righteous are You, O Yahweh, When I plead towards you, Only, judgments do I speak with Thee, Wherefore did the way of the wicked prosper? At rest have been all treacherous dealers.
\v 2 You hast planted them, yea, they have taken root, They go on, yea, they have made fruit, Near are You in their mouth, And far off from their reins.
\v 3 And You, O Yahweh, You hast known me, You seest me, and hast tried my heart with Thee, Draw them away as sheep to slaughter, And separate them for a day of slaughter.
\v 4 Till when did the earth mourn, And the herb of the whole field wither? For the wickedness of those dwelling in it, Consumed have been beast and fowl, Because they said, 'He did not see our latter end.'
\v 5 For — with footmen you hast run, And they weary you, And how will you fret thyself with horses! Even in the land of peace, In which you are confident — And how will you in the rising of Jordan!
\v 6 For even your brethren and the house of your father, Even they dealt treacherously against you, Even they — they called after you fully, Trust not in them, when they speak to you good things.
\v 7 I have forsaken My house, I have left Mine inheritance, I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.
\v 8 Mine inheritance had been to Me as a lion in a forest, She gave forth against Me with her voice, Therefore I have hated her.
\v 9 A speckled fowl is Mine inheritance to Me? Is the fowl round about against her? Come, assemble, every beast of the field, Come you for food.
\v 10 Many shepherds did destroy My vineyard, They have trodden down My portion, They have made My desirable portion Become a wilderness — a desolation.
\v 11 He had made it become a desolation, The desolation had mourned unto Me, Desolated had been all the land, But there is no one laying it to heart.
\v 12 On all high places in the plain have spoilers come in, For the sword of Yahweh is consuming, From the end of the land even unto the end of the land, There is no peace to any flesh.
\v 13 They sowed wheat, and have thorns reaped, They have become sick — they profit not, And they have been ashamed of your increases, Because of the fierceness of the anger of Yahweh.
\v 14 Thus said Yahweh concerning all my evil neighbours, who are striking against the inheritance that I caused my people — Israel — to inherit: 'Lo, I am plucking them from off their ground, And the house of Judah I pluck out of their middle.
\v 15 And it had been, after My plucking them out, I turn back, and have pitied them, And I have brought them back, Each to his inheritance, and each to his land.
\v 16 And it had come to pass, If they learn well the ways of My people, To swear by My name, 'Yahweh lived,' As they taught My people to swear by Baal, Then they have been built up in the middle of My people.
\v 17 And if they do not hearken, Then I have plucked up that nation, Plucking up and destroying, An affirmation of Yahweh!'
\c 13
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh unto me, 'Go, and you hast got for you a girdle of linen, and hast placed it on your loins, and into water you will not cause it to enter:'
\v 2 and I get the girdle, according to the word of Yahweh, and I place it on my loins.
\v 3 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me a second time, saying,
\v 4 Take the girdle that you hast got, that is on your loins, and rise, go to Phrat, and hide it there in a hole of the rock;
\v 5 and I go and hide it by Phrat, as Yahweh commanded me.
\v 6 And it came to pass, at the end of many days, that Yahweh said unto me, 'Rise, go to Phrat, and take there the girdle, that I commanded you to hide there;'
\v 7 and I go to Phrat, and dig, and take the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and behold, the girdle had been marred, it is not profitable for anything.
\v 8 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh:
\v 9 Thus do I mar the excellency of Judah, And the great excellency of Jerusalem.
\v 10 This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, Who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, And go after other gods to serve them, And to bow themselves to them, Yea it is — as this girdle, that is not profitable for anything.
\v 11 For, as the girdle cleaveth unto the loins of a man, So I caused to cleave unto Me The whole house of Israel, And the whole house of Judah, an affirmation of Yahweh, To be to Me for a people, and for a name, And for praise, and for beauty, And they have not hearkened.
\v 12 And you hast said unto them this word, Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, 'Every bottle is full of wine,' And they have said unto you: 'Do we not certainly know that every bottle is full of wine?'
\v 13 And you hast said unto them, 'Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am filling all the inhabitants of this land, And the kings who sit for David on his throne, And the priests, and the prophets, And all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, With drunkenness,
\v 14 And have dashed them one against another, And the fathers and the sons together, An affirmation of Yahweh, I do not pity, nor spare, nor have I mercy, So as not to destroy them.
\v 15 Hear, and give ear — be not haughty, For Yahweh had spoken.
\v 16 Give you to Yahweh your God honour, Before He did cause darkness, And before your feet stumble on dark mountains, And you have waited for light, And He had made it for death-shade, And had appointed it for thick darkness.
\v 17 And if you do not hear it, In secret places did my soul weep, because of pride, Yea, it weepeth sore, And the tear came down mine eyes, For the flock of Yahweh had been taken captive.
\v 18 Say to the king and to the mistress: Make yourselves low — sit still, For come down have your principalities, The crown of your beauty.
\v 19 The cities of the south have been shut up, And there is none opening, Judah had been removed — all of her, She had been removed completely — 
\v 20 Lift up your eyes, and see those coming in from the north, Where is the drove given to you, your beautiful flock?
\v 21 What will you say, when He looketh after you? And you — you hast taught them to be over you — leaders for head? Do not pangs seize you as a travailing woman?
\v 22 And when you will say in your heart, 'Wherefore have these met me?' For the abundance of yours iniquity Have your skirts been uncovered, Have your heels suffered violence.
\v 23 Doth a Cushite change his skin? and a leopard his spots? Ye also are able to do good, who are accustomed to do evil.
\v 24 And I scatter them as stubble, Passing away, by a wind of the wilderness.
\v 25 This is your lot, the portion of your measures from Me — an affirmation of Yahweh, Because you hast forgotten me, And will trust in falsehood.
\v 26 I also have made bare your skirts before your face, And your shame had been seen.
\v 27 Thine adulteries, and your neighings, The wickedness of your whoredom, on heights in a field, I have seen yours abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem, You are not cleansed, after when is it again?
\c 14
\v 1 That which had been the word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah concerning the matters of the dearths:
\v 2 Mourned had Judah, and her gates have languished, They have mourned to the earth, And the cry of Jerusalem had gone up.
\v 3 And their honourable ones have sent their little ones to the water, They have come unto ditches, They have not found water, They have turned back — their vessels empty! They have been ashamed, And have blushed and covered their head.
\v 4 Because the ground had been broken, For there had been no rain in the land, Ashamed have been husbandmen, They have covered their head.
\v 5 For even the hind in the field had brought forth — to forsake it! For there had been no grass.
\v 6 And wild asses have stood on high places, They have swallowed up wind like dragons, Consumed have been their eyes, for there is no herb.
\v 7 Surely our iniquities have testified against us, O Yahweh, work for Your name's sake, For many have been our backslidings, Against Thee we have sinned.
\v 8 O Hope of Israel — its saviour in time of trouble, Why are You as a sojourner in the land? And as a traveller turned aside to lodge?
\v 9 Why are You as one dumb? As a mighty one not able to save? And You are in our middle, O Yahweh, And Your name over us is called, leave us not.
\v 10 Thus said Yahweh concerning this people: Well they have loved to wander, Their feet they have not restrained, And Yahweh had not accepted them, Now did He remember their iniquity, And inspect their sin.
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto me: You will not pray for this people for good,
\v 12 When they fast, I hearken not unto their cry, And when they cause to ascend burnt-offering and present, I accept them not, For by sword, and by famine, And by pestilence, I am consuming them.
\v 13 And I say, 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, Lo, the prophets are saying to them: Ye do not see a sword, yea, famine is not to you, For true peace I give to you in this place.'
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto me: Falsehood the prophets are prophesying in My name, I did not send them, nor command them, Nor have I spoken unto them: A false vision, and divination, and vanity, And the deceit of their own heart, they are prophesying to you.
\v 15 Therefore, thus said Yahweh concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, and I have not sent them, and they are saying, Sword and famine is not in this land: By sword and by famine are these prophets consumed.
\v 16 And the people to whom they are prophesying, Are cast into out-places of Jerusalem, Because of the famine, and of the sword, And they have none burying them, Them, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, And I have poured out upon them this evil.
\v 17 And you hast said unto them this word: Tears come down mine eyes night and day, And they do not cease, For, with a great breach, Broken had been the virgin daughter of my people, A very grievous stroke.
\v 18 If I have gone forth to the field, Then, behold, the pierced of the sword! And if I have entered the city, Then, behold, the diseased of famine! For both prophet and priest have gone up and down Unto a land that they knew not.
\v 19 Hast You utterly rejected Judah? Zion had Your soul loathed? Wherefore hast You smitten us, And there is no healing to us? Looking for peace, and there is no good, And for a time of healing, and behold, terror.
\v 20 We have known, O Yahweh, our wickedness, The iniquity of our fathers, For we have sinned against Thee.
\v 21 Do not despise, for Your name's sake, Dishonour not the throne of Thine honour, Remember, break not Your covenant with us.
\v 22 Are there among the vanities of the nations any causing rain? And do the heavens give showers? Art not You He, O Yahweh our God? And we wait for you, for You — You hast done all these!
\c 15
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto me: Yough Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My soul is not toward this people, Send from before My face, and they go out.
\v 2 And it had come to pass, when they say to you, Whither do we go out? that you hast said unto them, Thus said Yahweh: Those who are for death — to death, And those who are for the sword, to the sword, And those who are for famine, to famine, And those who are for captivity, to captivity.
\v 3 And I have appointed over them four kinds, an affirmation of Yahweh, The sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, And the fowl of the heavens, And the beast of the earth, to consume and to devour.
\v 4 And I have given them for a trembling To all kingdoms of the earth, Because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah, For that which he did in Jerusalem.
\v 5 For who had pity on you, O Jerusalem? And who did bemoan for you? And who turneth aside to ask of your welfare?
\v 6 You — you hast left Me — an affirmation of Yahweh, Backward you goest, And I stretch out My hand against you, And I destroy you, I have been weary of repenting,
\v 7 And I scatter them with a fan, in the gates the land, I bereaved, I have destroyed My people, From their ways they turned not back.
\v 8 Its widows have been more to Me than the sand of the seas, I brought in to them — against the mother — A young man — a spoiler — at noon. I caused to fall upon her suddenly, wrath and trouble.
\v 9 Languished had the bearer of seven, She had breathed out her spirit, Gone in had her sun while yet day, It had been ashamed and confounded, And their residue to the sword I give up before their enemies, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 10 Woe to me, my mother, For you hast borne me a man of strife, And a man of contention to all the land, I have not lent on usury, Nor have they lent on usury to me — All of them are reviling me.
\v 11 Yahweh said, Did I not direct you for good? Did not I intercede for you in a time of evil, And in a time of adversity, with the enemy?
\v 12 Doth one break iron — northern iron, and brass?
\v 13 Your strength and your treasures For a prey I do give — not for price, Even for all your sins, and in all your borders.
\v 14 And I have caused yours enemies To pass over into the land — You hast not known, For a fire had been kindled in Mine anger, Against you it did burn.
\v 15 You, You hast known, O Yahweh, Remember me, and inspect me, And take vengeance for me of my pursuers, In Your long-suffering take me not away, Know — I have borne for Thee reproach.
\v 16 Your words have been found, and I eat them, And Your word is to me for a joy, And for the rejoicing of my heart, For Your name is called on me, O Yahweh, God of Hosts.
\v 17 I have not sat in an assembly of deriders, Nor do I exult, because of your hand, — Alone I have sat, For with indignation You hast filled me.
\v 18 Why had my pain been perpetual? And my wound incurable? It had refused to be healed, You are surely to me as a failing stream, Waters not stedfast.
\v 19 Therefore, thus said Yahweh: If you turnest back, then I bring you back, Before Me you will stand, And if you bringest out the precious from the vile, As My mouth you are! They — they turn back unto you, And you will not turn back unto them.
\v 20 And I have made you to this people For a wall — brazen — fenced, And they have fought against you, And they do not prevail against you, For with you am I to save you, And to deliver you — an affirmation of Yahweh,
\v 21 And I have delivered you from the hand of evil doers, And I have ransomed you From the hand of the terrible!
\c 16
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 2 You will not take to you a wife, Nor hast you sons and daughters in this place.
\v 3 For thus said Yahweh, Of the sons and of the daughters who are born in this place, And of their mothers — those bearing them, And of their fathers — those begetting them in this land:
\v 4 Of painful deaths they die, They are not lamented, nor are they buried, For dung on the face of the ground they are, And by sword and by famine are consumed, And their carcase had been for food To the fowl of the heavens, And to the beast of the earth.
\v 5 For thus said Yahweh: Do not enter the house of a mourning-feast, Nor go to lament nor bemoan for them, For I have removed My peace from this people, An affirmation of Yahweh, The kindness and the mercies.
\v 6 And died have great and small in this land, They are not buried, and none lament for them, Nor did any cut himself, nor become bald for them.
\v 7 Nor do they deal out to them for mourning, To comfort him concerning the dead, Nor cause them to drink a cup of consolations For his father and for his mother.
\v 8 A house of banqueting you will not enter, To sit with them, to eat and to drink,
\v 9 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am causing to cease from this place, Before your eyes, and in your days, The voice of joy, and the voice of rejoicing, The voice of bridegroom and voice of bride.
\v 10 And it had come to pass when you declarest to this people all these words, and they have said unto you, 'For what had Yahweh spoken against us all this great evil? yea, what is our iniquity, and what our sin, that we have sinned against Yahweh our God?'
\v 11 Then you hast said unto them: Because that your fathers have forsaken Me, An affirmation of Yahweh, And go after other gods, and serve them, And they bow themselves to them, And Me have forsaken, and My law not kept,
\v 12 Ye also have done evil above your fathers, And behold, you are walking each after the stubbornness of his evil heart, So as not to hearken unto Me.
\v 13 And I have cast you from off this land, On to a land that you have not known, Ye and your fathers, And you have served there other gods by day and by night, Where I do not give to you grace.
\v 14 Therefore, behold, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And it is not said any more: 'Yahweh lived, who brought up The sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
\v 15 But, 'Yahweh lived, who brought up The sons of Israel out of the land of the north, And out of all the lands where He drove them,' And I have brought them back to their land, That I gave to their fathers.
\v 16 Lo, I am sending for many fishers, An affirmation of Yahweh, And they have fished them, And after this I send for many hunters, And they have hunted them from off every mountain, And from off every hill, and from holes of the rocks.
\v 17 For Mine eyes are upon all their ways, They have not been hidden from My face, Nor had their iniquity been concealed from before Mine eyes.
\v 18 And I have recompensed a first — A second time — their iniquity and their sin, Because of their polluting My land, With the carcase of their detestable things, Yea, their abominable things have filled Mine inheritance.
\v 19 O Yahweh, my strength, and my fortress, And my refuge in a day of adversity, Unto Thee nations do come from the ends of earth, And say, Only falsehood did our fathers inherit, Vanity, and none among them is profitable.
\v 20 Doth man make for himself gods, And they — no gods?
\v 21 Therefore, behold, I am causing them to know at this time, I cause them to know My hand and My might, And they have known that My name is Yahweh!
\c 17
\v 1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, With the point of a diamond, Graven on the tablet of their heart, And on the horns of your altars,
\v 2 As their sons remember their altars and their shrines, By the green tree, by the high hills.
\v 3 O My mountain in the field — your strength, All your treasures — for a prey I give, Your high places for sin in all your borders.
\v 4 And you hast let go — even through thyself, Of yours inheritance that I gave to you, And I have caused you to serve yours enemies, In a land that you hast not known, For a fire you have kindled in Mine anger, Unto the age it did burn.
\v 5 Thus said Yahweh: Cursed is the man who did trust in man, And had made flesh his arm, And from Yahweh whose heart turneth.
\v 6 And he had been as a naked thing in a desert, And did not see when good came, And had inhabited parched places in a wilderness, A salt land, and not inhabited.
\v 7 Blessed is the man who trusteth in Yahweh, And whose confidence had been Yahweh.
\v 8 And had been as a tree planted by waters, And by a rivulet he sent forth his roots, And he did not see when heat came, And his leaf had been green, And in a year of dearth he is not sorrowful, Nor did he cease from making fruit.
\v 9 Crooked is the heart above all things, And it is incurable — who did know it?
\v 10 I Yahweh do search the heart, try the reins, Even to give to each according to his way, According to the fruit of his doings.
\v 11 A partridge hatching, and not bringing forth, Is one making wealth, and not by right, In the middle of his days he did forsake it, And in his latter end — he is a fool.
\v 12 A throne of honour on high from the beginning, The place of our sanctuary,
\v 13 The hope of Israel is Yahweh, All forsaking Thee are ashamed, And 'My apostates' in the earth are written, For they have forsaken Yahweh, A fountain of living waters.
\v 14 Heal me, O Yahweh, and I am healed, Save me, and I am saved, for my praise are You.
\v 15 Lo, they are saying unto me: 'Where is the word of Yahweh? pray, let it come.'
\v 16 And I hastened not from feeding after Thee, And the desperate day I have not desired, You — You hast known, The produce of my lips, before Your face it had been,
\v 17 Be not You to me for a terror, My hope are You in a day of evil.
\v 18 Let my pursuers be ashamed, and let not me be ashamed — me! Let them be frightened, and let not me be frightened — me! Bring in on them a day of evil, And a second time with destruction destroy them.
\v 19 Thus said Yahweh unto me: 'Go, and you hast stood in the gate of the sons of the people, by which kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all gates of Jerusalem,
\v 20 and you hast said unto them: Hear a word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are coming in by these gates,
\v 21 Thus said Yahweh, Take you heed to yourselves, And you bear not a burden on the day of rest, Nor have you brought it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
\v 22 Nor do you take out a burden from your houses on the day of rest, Yea, any work you do not do, And you have sanctified the day of rest, As I have commanded your fathers.
\v 23 And they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, And they stiffen their neck not to hear, And not to receive instruction.
\v 24 And it had been, if you certainly hearken unto Me, An affirmation of Yahweh, So as not to bring in a burden By the gates of this city on the day of rest, And to sanctify the day of rest, So as not to do in it any work — 
\v 25 Then entered by the gates of this city have kings and princes, Sitting on the throne of David, Riding in a chariot, and on horses, They, and their princes, the man of Judah, And inhabitants of Jerusalem, And this city had remained to the age.
\v 26 And they have come in from cities of Judah, And from suburbs of Jerusalem, And from the land of Benjamin, And from the low country, And from the hill-country, and from the south, Bringing in burnt-offering, and sacrifice, And present, and frankincense, And bringing praise to the house of Yahweh.
\v 27 And if you do not hearken unto me to sanctify the day of rest, And so as not to bear a burden, And to come in at the gates of Jerusalem on the day of rest, Then I have kindled a fire in its gates, And it had consumed the high places of Jerusalem, And it is not quenched!'
\c 18
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Rise, and you hast gone down to the potter's house, and there I cause you to hear My words;
\v 3 and I go down to the potter's house, and behold, he is doing a work on the stones,
\v 4 and marred is the vessel that he is making, as clay in the hand of the potter, and he had turned and he made it another vessel, as it was right in the eyes of the potter to make.
\v 5 And there is a word of Yahweh to me, saying:
\v 6 As this potter am I not able to do to you? O house of Israel, an affirmation of Yahweh. Lo, as clay in the hand of the potter, So are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
\v 7 The moment I speak concerning a nation, And concerning a kingdom, To pluck up and to break down, and to destroy,
\v 8 And that nation had turned from its evil, Because I have spoken against it, Then I have repented of the evil that I thought to do to it.
\v 9 And the moment I speak concerning a nation, And concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant,
\v 10 And it had done the evil thing in Mine eyes, So as not to hearken to My voice, Then I have repented of the good That I have spoken of doing to it.
\v 11 And now, speak, I pray you, unto men of Judah, And against inhabitants of Jerusalem, Saying: Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am framing against you evil, And devising against you a device, Turn back, I pray you, each from his evil way And amen your ways and your doings.
\v 12 And they have said, It is incurable, For after our own devices we do go, And each the stubbornness of his evil heart we do.
\v 13 Therefore, thus said Yahweh: Ask, I pray you, among the nations, Who had heard like these? A very horrible thing had the virgin of Israel done.
\v 14 Doth snow of Lebanon Cease from the rock of the field? Failed are the cold strange waters that flow?
\v 15 But My people have forgotten Me, to a vain thing they make perfume, And they cause them to stumble in their ways — paths of old, To walk in paths — a way not raised up,
\v 16 To make their land become a desolation, A hissing age-during, Every passer by it is astonished, And bemoaneth with his head.
\v 17 As an east wind I scatter them before an enemy, The neck, and not the face, I shew them, In the day of their calamity.'
\v 18 And they say, Come, And we devise against Jeremiah devices, For law did not perish from the priest, Nor counsel from the wise, Nor the word from the prophet, Come, and we smite him with the tongue, And we do not attend to any of his words.
\v 19 Give attention, O Yahweh, unto me, And hearken to the voice of those contending with me.
\v 20 Is evil recompensed instead of good, That they have dug a pit for my soul? Remember my standing before Thee to speak good of them, To turn back Your wrath from them.
\v 21 Therefore, give up their sons to famine, And cause them to run on the sides of the sword, And their wives are bereaved and widows, And their men are killed by death, Their young men smitten by sword in battle,
\v 22 A cry is heard from their houses, For You bringest against them suddenly a troop, For they dug a pit to capture me, And snares they have hidden for my feet.
\v 23 And You, O Yahweh, You hast known, All their counsel against me is for death, You will not cover over their iniquity, Nor their sin from before Thee blottest out, And they are made to stumble before Thee, In the time of Thine anger work against them!
\c 19
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh, 'Go, and you hast got a potter's earthen vessel, and of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests,
\v 2 and you hast gone forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, that is at the opening of the gate of the pottery, and hast proclaimed there the words that I speak unto you,
\v 3 and hast said, Hear a word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: 'Lo, I am bringing in evil on this place, at which the ears of every one who is hearing it do tingle,
\v 4 because that they have forsaken Me, and make known this place, and make perfume in it to other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah, and they have filled this place with innocent blood,
\v 5 and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire, burnt-offerings to Baal, that I commanded not, nor spake of, nor did it come up on My heart.
\v 6 Therefore, behold, days are coming — an affirmation of Yahweh — and this place is not called any more, Tophet, and Valley of the son of Hinnom, but, Valley of slaughter.
\v 7 And I have made void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and have caused them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those seeking their life, and I have given their carcase for food to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the earth,
\v 8 and I have made this city for a desolation, and for a hissing, every passer by it is astonished, and did hiss for all its plagues.
\v 9 And I have caused them to eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters, and each the flesh of his friend they do eat, in the siege and in the straitness with which straiten them do their enemies, and those seeking their life.
\v 10 'And you hast broken the bottle before the eyes of the men who are going with you,
\v 11 and hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Thus do I break this people and this city, as one breaketh the potter's vessel, that is not able to be repaired again, and in Tophet they bury — without place to bury;
\v 12 so I do to this place — an affirmation of Yahweh — and to its inhabitants, so as to make this city as Tophet;
\v 13 and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, have been — as the place of Tophet — defiled, even all the houses on whose roofs they have made perfume to all the host of the heavens, so as to pour out oblations to other gods.'
\v 14 And Jeremiah came in from Tophet, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he standeth in the court of the house of Yahweh, and he said unto all the people:
\v 15 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am bringing in unto this city, and on all its cities, all the evil that I have spoken against it, for they have hardened their neck — not to hear My words!'
\c 20
\v 1 And Pashhur son of Immer the priest — who also is overseer, leader in the house of Yahweh — heareth Jeremiah prophesying these things,
\v 2 and Pashhur smiteth Jeremiah the prophet, and putteth him unto the stocks, that are by the high gate of Benjamin, that is by the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 and it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought out Jeremiah from the stocks, and Jeremiah said unto him, 'Not Pashhur had Yahweh called your name, but — Magor-Missabib.
\v 4 For thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am making you for a fear to thyself, And to all loving you, And they have fallen by the sword of their enemies, and yours eyes are beholding, And all Judah I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, And he had removed them to Babylon, And he had smitten them with the sword.
\v 5 And I have given all the strength of this city, And all its labour, and all its precious things, Yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah I do give into the hand of their enemies, And they have spoiled them, and taken them, And have brought them into Babylon.
\v 6 And you, Pashhur, and all dwelling in your house, Do go into captivity. and Babylon you will enter, And there you diest, and there you are buried, You and all loving you, To whom you hast prophesied falsely.'
\v 7 You hast persuaded me, O Yahweh, and I am persuaded; You hast hardened me, and will prevail, I have been for a laughter all the day, Every one is mocking at me,
\v 8 Because from the time I speak I cry out, 'Violence and destruction,' I cry, For the word of Yahweh had been to me For reproach and for derision all the day.
\v 9 And I said, 'I do not mention Him, Nor do I speak any more in His name,' And it had been in my heart As a burning fire shut up in my bones, And I have been weary of containing, And I am not able.
\v 10 For I have heard the evil report of many, Fear is round about: 'Declare, and we declare it,' All mine allies are watching for my halting, 'Perhaps he is enticed, and we prevail over him, And we take our vengeance out of him.'
\v 11 And Yahweh is with me, as a terrible mighty one, Therefore my persecutors stumble and prevail not, They have been exceedingly ashamed, For they have not acted wisely, Confusion age-during is not forgotten.
\v 12 And, O Yahweh of Hosts, trier of the righteous, Beholder of reins and heart, I do see Your vengeance out of them, For unto Thee I have revealed my cause.
\v 13 Sing you to Yahweh, praise Yahweh, For He had delivered the soul of the needy From the hand of evil doers.
\v 14 Cursed is the day in which I was born, The day that my mother bare me, Let it not be blessed!
\v 15 Cursed is the man who bore tidings to my father, saying, 'Born to you had been a child — a male,' Making him very glad!
\v 16 Then had that man been as the cities, That Yahweh overthrew, and repented not, And he had heard a cry at morning, And a shout at time of noon.
\v 17 Because he had not put me to death from the womb, And my mother is to me — my grave, And her womb a pregnancy age-during.
\v 18 Why is this? from the womb I have come out, To see labour and sorrow, Yea, consumed in shame are my days!
\c 21
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, in the king Zedekiah's sending unto him Pashhur son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
\v 2 'Inquire, we pray you, for us at Yahweh, for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had fought against us; perhaps Yahweh did deal with us according to all His wonders, and did cause him to go up from off us.'
\v 3 And Jeremiah said unto them, 'Thus do you say unto Zedekiah,
\v 4 Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel: Lo, I am turning round the weapons of battle That are in your hand, With which you do fight the king of Babylon, And the Chaldeans, who are laying siege against you, At the outside of the wall, And I have gathered them into the middle of this city,
\v 5 And I — I have fought against you, With a stretched-out hand, and with a strong arm, And in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath,
\v 6 And I have smitten the inhabitants of this city, Both man and beast, By a great pestilence do they die.
\v 7 And after this — an affirmation of Yahweh, I give Zedekiah king of Judah, And his servants, and the people, And those left in this city, From the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, Into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, And into the hand of their enemies, And into the hand of those seeking their life, And he had smitten them by the mouth of the sword, He had no pity on them, Nor did he spare, nor had he mercy.
\v 8 And unto this people you will say, Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am setting before you the way of life, And the way of death!
\v 9 Whoso is abiding in this city — dieth, By sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, And whoso is going forth, And had fallen unto the Chaldeans, Who are laying siege against you — lived, And his life had been to him for a spoil.
\v 10 For I have set My face against this city for evil, And not for good — an affirmation of Yahweh. Into the hand of the king of Babylon it is given, And he had burned it with fire.
\v 11 And as to the house of the king of Judah, Hear you a word of Yahweh;
\v 12 O house of David, thus said Yahweh: Decide you judgment at morning, And deliver the plundered from the hand of the oppressor, Lest My fury go forth as fire, And had burned, and none is quenching, Because of the evil of your doings.
\v 13 Lo, I am against you — an affirmation of Yahweh, O inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain, Who are saying, Who came down against us? And who came into our habitations?
\v 14 And I have laid a charge against you, According to the fruit of your doings, An affirmation of Yahweh, And I have kindled a fire in its forest, And it had consumed — all its suburbs!
\c 22
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh, 'Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and you hast spoken there this word, and hast said,
\v 2 Hear a word of Yahweh, O king of Judah, who are sitting on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people, who are coming in at these gates,
\v 3 Thus said Yahweh: Do you judgment and righteousness, And deliver the plundered from the hand of the oppressor, And sojourner, orphan, and widow, you do not oppress nor wrong, And innocent blood you do not shed in this place.
\v 4 For, if you certainly do this thing, Then come in by the gates of this house Have kings sitting for David on his throne, Riding on chariot, and on horses, He, and his servants, and his people.
\v 5 And if you do not hear these words, By myself I have sworn — an affirmation of Yahweh, That this house is for a desolation.
\v 6 For thus said Yahweh, Concerning the house of the king of Judah: Gilead are you to Me — head of Lebanon, If not — I make you a wilderness, Cities not inhabited.
\v 7 And I have separated for you destroyers, Each with his weapons, And they have cut down the choice of your cedars, And have cast them on the fire.
\v 8 And many nations have passed by this city, And they have said, each to his neighbour, For what had Yahweh done thus to this great city?
\v 9 And they have said, 'Because that they have forsaken The covenant of Yahweh their God, And bow themselves to other gods, and serve them.'
\v 10 Ye do not weep for the dead, nor bemoan for him, Weep you sore for the traveller, For he did not return again, Nor had he seen the land of his birth.
\v 11 For thus said Yahweh concerning Shallum son of Josiah king of Judah, who is reigning instead of Josiah his father, who had gone forth from this place: He did not turn back hither again;
\v 12 For in the place where they have removed him he dieth, And this land he did not see again.
\v 13 Woe to him who is building his house by unrighteousness, And his upper chambers by injustice, On his neighbour he laid service for nought, And his wage he did not give to him.
\v 14 Who is saying, 'I build for myself a large house, And airy upper chambers,' And he had cut out for himself its windows, Ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\v 15 Dost you reign, because you are fretting thyself in cedar? Your father — did he not eat and drink? Yea, he did judgment and righteousness, Then it is well with him.
\v 16 He decided the cause of the poor and needy, Then it is well — is it not to know Me? An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 17 But yours eyes and your heart are not, Except on your dishonest gain, And on shedding of innocent blood, And on oppression, and on doing of violence.
\v 18 Therefore, thus said Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: They do not lament for him, Ah, my brother, and Ah, sister, They do not lament for him, Ah, lord, and Ah, his honour.
\v 19 The burial of an ass — he is buried, Dragged and cast out there to the gates of Jerusalem.
\v 20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry, And in Bashan give forth your voice, And cry from Abarim, For destroyed have been all loving you.
\v 21 I have spoken unto you in yours ease, You hast said, 'I do not hearken,' This is your way from your youth, For you hast not hearkened to My voice.
\v 22 All your friends consume did wind, And your lovers into captivity do go, Surely then you are ashamed, And hast blushed for all your wickedness.
\v 23 O dweller in Lebanon, making a nest among cedars, How gracious hast you been when pangs come to you, Pain — as of a travailing woman.
\v 24 I live — an affirmation of Yahweh, Yough Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah Were a seal on My right hand, Surely there I draw you away,
\v 25 And I have given you into the hand of those seeking your life, And into hands of which you are afraid, Into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, And into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 26 And I have cast you, And your mother who bore you, unto another country, Where you were not born, and there do you die.
\v 27 And to the land where they are lifting up their soul to return, Thither they do not return.
\v 28 A grief — a despised broken thing — is this man Coniah? A vessel in which there is no pleasure? Wherefore have they been cast up and down, He and his seed, Yea, they were cast on to a land that they knew not?
\v 29 Earth, earth, earth, hear a word of Yahweh,
\v 30 Thus said Yahweh: Write you this man childless, A man — he did not prosper in his days, For none of his seed did prosper, Sitting on the throne of David, And ruling again in Judah!
\c 23
\v 1 Woe to shepherds destroying, And scattering the flock of My pasture, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 2 Therefore, thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Against the shepherds who feed My people, Ye have scattered My flock, and drive them away, And have not inspected them, Lo, I am charging on you the evil of your doings, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 3 And I do gather the remnant of My flock Out of all the lands where I drove them, And have brought them back unto their fold, And they have been fruitful, and multiplied.
\v 4 And I have raised for them shepherds, And they have fed them, And they fear no more, nor are frightened, Nor are they lacking — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 5 Lo, days are coming — an affirmation of Yahweh, And I have raised to David a righteous shoot, And a king had reigned and acted wisely, And done judgment and righteousness in the earth.
\v 6 In his days is Judah saved, and Israel dwelleth confidently, And this his name that Yahweh proclaimeth him, 'Our Righteousness.'
\v 7 Therefore, behold, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And they do not say any more, Yahweh lived who brought up The sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,
\v 8 But — Yahweh lived, who brought up, And who brought in, the seed of the house of Israel, From the land of the north, And from all the lands where I drove them, And they have dwelt on their own ground!
\v 9 In reference to the prophets: Broken had been my heart in my middle, Fluttered have all my bones, I have been as a man — a drunkard, And as a man — wine had passed over him, Because of Yahweh, and of His holy words.
\v 10 For of adulterers had the land been full, For because of these had the land mourned, Dried up had been the pleasant places of the wilderness, And their course is evil, and their might — not right.
\v 11 For both prophet and priest have been profane, Yea, in My house I found their wickedness, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 12 Therefore is their way to them as slippery places, Into thick darkness they are driven, And they have fallen in it, For I bring in against them evil, The year of their inspection, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 13 And in prophets of Samaria I have seen folly, They have prophesied by Baal, And cause my people — Israel — to err.
\v 14 And in prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing, Committing adultery, and walking falsely, Yea, they strengthened the hands of evil doers, So that they have not turned back Each from his wickedness, They have been to me — all of them — as Sodom, And its inhabitants as Gomorrah.
\v 15 Therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, concerning the prophets: Lo, I am causing them to eat wormwood, And have caused them to drink water of gall, For, from prophets of Jerusalem Hath profanity gone forth to all the land.
\v 16 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Ye do not hearken unto the words Of the prophets who are prophesying to you, They are making you vain things, A vision of their own heart they speak, Not from the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 17 Saying diligently to those despising The word of Yahweh: Peace is for you, And to every one walking in the stubbornness of his heart they have said: Evil did not come in unto you.
\v 18 For who had stood in the counsel of Yahweh, And saw and heareth His word? Who had regarded My word, and hearkeneth?
\v 19 Lo, a whirlwind of Yahweh — Fury had gone out, even a piercing whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.
\v 20 The anger of Yahweh did not turn back Till His doing, and till His establishing, The thoughts of His heart, In the latter end of the days you attend to it With understanding.
\v 21 I have not sent the prophets, and they have run, I have not spoken unto them, and they have prophesied.
\v 22 But — if they stood in My counsel, Then they cause My people to hear My words, And they turn them back from their evil way, And from the evil of their doings.
\v 23 A God near am I — an affirmation of Yahweh, And not a God afar off?
\v 24 Is any one hidden in secret places, And I see him not? an affirmation of Yahweh, Do not I fill the heavens and the earth? An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 25 I have heard that which the prophets said, Who prophesy in My name falsehood, saying, 'I have dreamed, I have dreamed.'
\v 26 Till when is it in the heart of the prophets? The prophets of falsehood, Yea, prophets of the deceit of their heart,
\v 27 Who are devising to cause My people To forget My name by their dreams, That they recount each to his neighbour, As their fathers forgot my name for Baal.
\v 28 The prophet with whom is a dream, Let him recount the dream, And he with whom is My word, Let him truly speak My word. What — to the straw with the corn? An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 29 Is it not thus? My word is as a fire, An affirmation of Yahweh. And as a hammer — it breaketh in pieces a rock.
\v 30 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, An affirmation of Yahweh, Stealing My words each from his neighbour.
\v 31 Lo, I am against the prophets, An affirmation of Yahweh, Who are making smooth their tongue, And they affirm — an affirmation.
\v 32 Lo, I am against the prophets of false dreams, An affirmation of Yahweh, And they recount them, and cause my people to err, By their falsehoods, and by their instability, And I — I have not sent them, Nor have I commanded them, And they are not at all profitable to this people, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 33 And when this people, or the prophet, Or a priest, did ask you, saying, What is the burden of Yahweh? Then you hast said unto them: Ye are the burden, and I have left you, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 34 And the prophet, and the priest, and the people, That said, The burden of Yahweh, I have seen after that man, and after his house.
\v 35 Thus do you say each unto his neighbour, And each unto his brother: What had Yahweh answered? And what had Yahweh spoken?
\v 36 And the burden of Yahweh you do not mention any more, For the burden to each is — His word, And you have overturned the words of the living God, Yahweh of Hosts, our God.
\v 37 Thus will you say unto the prophet What had Yahweh answered you? And what had Yahweh spoken?
\v 38 And if the burden of Yahweh you say, Therefore thus said Yahweh: Because of your saying this word, The burden of Yahweh, And I do send unto you, saying, Ye do not say, The burden of Yahweh.
\v 39 Therefore, behold, I — I have taken you utterly away, And I have sent you out, And the city that I gave to you, And to your fathers, from before My face,
\v 40 And I have put on you reproach age-during, And shame age-during that is not forgotten!
\c 24
\v 1 Yahweh had showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs, appointed before the temple of Yahweh, — after the removing by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, of Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the heads of Judah, and the artisan, and the smith, from Jerusalem, when he brought them into Babylon — 
\v 2 In the one basket are figs very good, like the first-ripe figs, and in the other basket are figs very bad, that are not eaten for badness.
\v 3 And Yahweh said unto me, 'What are you seeing, Jeremiah?' and I say, 'Figs, the good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, that are not eaten for badness.'
\v 4 And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:
\v 5 Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Like these good figs so do I acknowledge The removed of Judah — that I sent from this place, To the land of the Chaldeans — for good.
\v 6 And I have set Mine eyes on them for good, And have brought them back to this land, And built them up, and I throw not down, And have planted them, and pluck not up.
\v 7 And have given to them a heart to know Me, For I am Yahweh, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to them for God, For they turned back unto Me with all their heart.
\v 8 And like the bad figs, that are not eaten for badness, Surely thus said Yahweh: So do I make Zedekiah king of Judah, And his heads, and the remnant of Jerusalem, Who are left in this land, And who are dwelling in the land of Egypt,
\v 9 And I have given them for a trembling, For evil — to all kingdoms of the earth, For a reproach, and for a simile, For a byword, and for a reviling, In all the places where I drive them.
\v 10 And I have sent against them the sword, The famine and the pestilence, Till their consumption from off the ground, That I gave to them and to their fathers!
\c 25
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, — it is the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, — 
\v 2 Which Jeremiah the prophet had spoken concerning all the people of Judah, even unto all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
\v 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, and unto this day — this three and twentieth year — had the word of Yahweh been unto me, and I speak unto you, rising early and speaking, and you have not hearkened;
\v 4 And Yahweh had sent unto you all His servants, the prophets, rising early and sending, and you have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear, saying:
\v 5 'Turn back, I pray you, each from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell on the ground that Yahweh had given to you and to your fathers from age unto age,
\v 6 And you do not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow yourselves to them, nor do you provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I do no evil to you;
\v 7 And you have not hearkened unto Me — an affirmation of Yahweh — so as to provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands for evil to you.
\v 8 'Therefore thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Because that you have not obeyed My words,
\v 9 Lo, I am sending, and have taken all the families of the north — an affirmation of Yahweh — even unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and have brought them in against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and have devoted them, and appointed them for an astonishment, and for a hissing, and for wastes age-during.
\v 10 And I have destroyed from them the voice of rejoicing, and the voice of joy, voice of bridegroom and voice of bride, noise of millstones, and the light of lamps.
\v 11 And all this land had been for a waste, for an astonishment, and these nations have served the king of Babylon seventy years.
\v 12 And it had come to pass, at the fulness of seventy years, I charge against the king of Babylon, and against that nation — an affirmation of Yahweh — their iniquity, and against the land of the Chaldeans, and have appointed it for desolations age-during.
\v 13 And I have brought in on that land all My words that I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book, that Jeremiah had prophesied concerning all the nations.
\v 14 For laid service on them — also them — have many nations and great kings, and I have given recompence to them according to their doing, and according to the work of their hands.
\v 15 'For thus said Yahweh God of Israel unto me, Take the wine cup of this fury out of My hand, and you hast caused all the nations to drink it unto whom I am sending you;
\v 16 And they have drunk, and shaken themselves and shewn themselves foolish, because of the sword that I am sending among them.
\v 17 'And I take the cup out of the hand of Yahweh, and cause all the nations to drink unto whom Yahweh sent me:
\v 18 Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, And its kings, its heads, To give them to waste, to astonishment, To hissing, and to reviling, as at this day.
\v 19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, And his heads, and all his people,
\v 20 And all the mixed people, And all the kings of the land of Uz, And all the kings of the land of the Philistines, And Ashkelon, and Gazzah, and Ekron, And the remnant of Ashdod,
\v 21 Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon,
\v 22 And all the kings of Tyre, And all the kings of Zidon, And the kings of the isle that is beyond the sea,
\v 23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, And all cutting the corners of the beard,
\v 24 And all the kings of Arabia, And all the kings of the mixed people, Who are dwelling in the wilderness,
\v 25 And all the kings of Zimri, And all the kings of Elam, And all the kings of Media,
\v 26 And all the kings of the north, The near and the far off, one unto another, And all the kingdoms of the earth, That are on the face of the ground, And king Sheshach drinketh after them.
\v 27 And you hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts God of Israel, Drink you, yea drink abundantly, And vomit, and fall, and rise not, Because of the sword that I am sending among you.
\v 28 And it had come to pass, When they refuse to receive the cup out of your hand to drink, That you hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Ye do certainly drink.
\v 29 For behold, in the city over which My name is called, I am beginning to do evil, And you — you are entirely acquitted! Ye are not acquitted, for a sword I am proclaiming, For all inhabitants of the land, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 30 And you, you will prophesy unto them all these words, and hast said unto them: Yahweh from the high place did roar, And from His holy habitation gave forth His voice, He surely roareth for His habitation, A shout as of treaders down, God answereth all the inhabitants of the land,
\v 31 Wasting had come unto the end of the earth, For a controversy had Yahweh with nations, He had executed judgment for all flesh, The wicked! He had given them to the sword, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 32 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Lo, evil is going out from nation to nation, And a great whirlwind is stirred up from the sides of the earth.
\v 33 And the pierced of Yahweh have been in that day, From the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth, They are not lamented, nor gathered, nor buried, For dung on the face of the ground they are.
\v 34 Howl, you shepherds, and cry, And roll yourselves, you honourable of the flock, For full have been your days, For slaughtering, and for your scatterings, And you have fallen as a desirable vessel.
\v 35 And perished had refuge from the shepherds, And escape from the honourable of the flock.
\v 36 A voice is of the cry of the shepherds, And a howling of the honourable of the flock, For Yahweh is spoiling their pasture.
\v 37 And the peaceable habitations have been cut down, Because of the fierceness of the anger of Yahweh.
\v 38 He had forsaken, as a young lion, His covert, Surely their land had become a desolation, Because of the oppressing fierceness, And because of the fierceness of His anger!
\c 26
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, had this word been from Yahweh, saying:
\v 2 Thus said Yahweh, Stand you in the court of the house of Yahweh, and you hast spoken unto all those of the cities of Judah who are coming in to bow themselves in the house of Yahweh, all the words that I have commanded you to speak unto them, you will not diminish a word.
\v 3 If so be they hearken, and turn back each from his evil way, then I have repented concerning the evil that I am thinking of doing to them, because of the evil of their doings.
\v 4 'And you hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh, If you do not hearken unto Me, to walk in My law, that I set before you,
\v 5 To hearken to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I am sending unto you, yea, rising early and sending, and you have not hearkened,
\v 6 Then I have given up this house as Shiloh, and this city I give up for a reviling to all nations of the earth.'
\v 7 And the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, hear Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Yahweh,
\v 8 And it came to pass, at the completion of Jeremiah's speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests, and the prophets, and all the people catch him, saying, You will surely die,
\v 9 Wherefore hast you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, 'As Shiloh this house shall be, and this city is wasted, without inhabitant?' and all the people are assembled unto Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh.
\v 10 And the heads of Judah hear these things, and they go up from the house of the king to the house of Yahweh, and sit in the opening of the new gate of Yahweh.
\v 11 And the priests and the prophets speak unto the heads, and unto all the people, saying, 'Judgment of death is for this man, for he had prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.'
\v 12 And Jeremiah spoke unto all the heads, and unto all the people, saying, 'Yahweh sent me to prophesy concerning this house, and concerning this city, all the words that you have heard;
\v 13 And now, amend your ways, and your doings, and hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God, and Yahweh did repent concerning the evil that He had spoken against you.
\v 14 And I, behold, I am in your hand, do to me as is good and as is right in your eyes;
\v 15 Only, know you certainly, that if you are putting me to death, surely innocent blood you are putting on yourselves, and on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly had Yahweh sent me unto you to speak in your ears all these words.'
\v 16 And the heads and all the people say unto the priests and unto the prophets, 'There is not for this man a judgment of death, for in the name of Yahweh our God he had spoken unto us.'
\v 17 And certain of the elders of the land rise up, and speak unto all the assembly of the people, saying,
\v 18 'Micah the Morashtite had been prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he said unto all the people of Judah, saying: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Zion is a plowed field, and Jerusalem is heaps, And the mountain of the house is for high places of a forest.
\v 19 'Put him at all to death did Hezekiah king of Judah, and all Judah? Did he not fear Yahweh? yea, he appeaseth the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh repenteth concerning the evil that He spake against them; and we are doing great evil against our souls.
\v 20 'And also there had been a man prophesying in the name of Yahweh, Urijah son of Shemaiah, of Kirjath-Jearim, and he prophesieth against this city, and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah,
\v 21 And the king Jehoiakim, and all his mighty ones, and all the heads, hear his words, and the king seeketh to put him to death, and Urijah heareth, and feareth, and fleeth, and went in to Egypt.
\v 22 And the king Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt — Elnathan son of Achbor, and men with him unto Egypt — 
\v 23 And they bring out Urijah from Egypt, and bring him in unto the king Jehoiakim, and he smiteth him with a sword, and threw his corpse unto the graves of the sons of the people.'
\v 24 Only, the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan had been with Jeremiah so as not to give him up into the hand of the people to put him to death.
\c 27
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, had this word been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh unto me, Make to you bands and yokes,
\v 3 And you hast put them on your neck, and hast sent them unto the king of Edom, and unto the king of Moab, and unto the king of the sons of Ammon, and unto the king of Tyre, and unto the king of Zidon, by the hand of messengers who are coming in to Jerusalem, unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
\v 4 And you hast commanded them for their lords, saying, Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel,
\v 5 Thus do you say unto your lords, I — I have made the earth with man, and the cattle that are on the face of the earth, by My great power, and by My stretched-out arm, and I have given it to whom it had been right in Mine eyes.
\v 6 And now, I — I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and also the beast of the field I have given to him to serve him;
\v 7 And served him have all the nations, and his son, and his son's son, till the coming in of the time of his land, also it; and done service for him have many nations and great kings.
\v 8 And it had come to pass, the nation and the kingdom that do not serve him — Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon — and that which putteth not its neck into the yoke of the king of Babylon, with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, I lay a charge on that nation — an affirmation of Yahweh — till I consume them by his hand.
\v 9 And you, you do not hearken unto your prophets, and unto your diviners, and unto your dreamers, and unto your observers of clouds, and unto your sorcerers who are speaking unto you, saying, Ye do not serve the king of Babylon, — 
\v 10 For falsehood they are prophesying to you, so as to remove you far from off your ground, and I have driven you out, and you have perished.
\v 11 And the nation that caused its neck to enter into the yoke of the king of Babylon, and had served him — I have left it on its ground — an affirmation of Yahweh — and it had tilled it, and dwelt in it.'
\v 12 And unto Zedekiah king of Judah I have spoken according to all these words, saying, 'Cause your necks to enter into the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\v 13 Why do you die, you and your people, by sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as Yahweh had spoken concerning the nation that did not serve the king of Babylon?
\v 14 And you do not hearken unto the words of the prophets who are speaking unto you, saying, Ye do not serve the king of Babylon, — for falsehood they are prophesying to you.
\v 15 For I have not sent them — an affirmation of Yahweh — and they are prophesying in My name falsely, so as to drive you out, and you have perished, you, and the prophets who are prophesying to you.'
\v 16 And unto the priests, and unto all this people, I have spoken, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh, Ye do not hearken unto the words of your prophets, who are prophesying to you, saying, Lo, the vessels of the house of Yahweh are brought back from Babylon now in haste, for falsehood they are prophesying to you.
\v 17 Ye do not hearken unto them, serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why is this city a waste?
\v 18 And, if they be prophets, and if a word of Yahweh be with them, let them intercede, I pray you, with Yahweh of Hosts, so that the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, have not gone into Babylon.
\v 19 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
\v 20 That Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had not taken, in his removing Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon with all the freemen of Judah and Jerusalem,
\v 21 Surely thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left of the house of Yahweh, and of the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
\v 22 To Babylon they are brought, and there they are till the day of My inspecting them — an affirmation of Yahweh; then I have brought them up, and have brought them back unto this place.'
\c 28
\v 1 And it came to pass, in that year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, spoken unto me had Hananiah son of Azur the prophet, who is of Gibeon, in the house of Yahweh, before the eyes of the priests, and all the people, saying,
\v 2 'Thus spake Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon;
\v 3 Within two years of days I am bringing back unto this place all the vessels of the house of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken from this place, and did carry to Babylon,
\v 4 And Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the removed of Judah, who are entering Babylon, I am bringing back unto this place — an affirmation of Yahweh; for I do break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'
\v 5 And Jeremiah the prophet said unto Hananiah the prophet, before the eyes of the priests, and before the eyes of all the people who are standing in the house of Yahweh,
\v 6 Yea, Jeremiah the prophet said, 'Amen! so may Yahweh do; Yahweh establish your words that you hast prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the house of Yahweh and all the removal from Babylon, unto this place.
\v 7 'Only, hear, I pray you, this word that I am speaking in yours ears, and in the ears of all the people.
\v 8 The prophets who have been before me, and before you, from of old, even they prophesy concerning many lands, and concerning great kingdoms, of battle, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\v 9 The prophet who did prophesy of peace — by the coming in of the word of the prophet, known is the prophet that Yahweh had truly sent him.'
\v 10 And Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and breaketh it,
\v 11 And Hananiah spoke before the eyes of all the people, saying, 'Thus said Yahweh, Thus I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, within two years of days, from off the neck of all the nations;' and Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.
\v 12 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah after the breaking, by Hananiah the prophet, of the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\v 13 'Go, and you hast spoken unto Hananiah, saying, Thus said Yahweh, Yokes of wood you hast broken, and I have made instead of them yokes of iron;
\v 14 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, A yoke of iron I have put on the neck of all these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they have served him, and also the beast of the field I have given to him.'
\v 15 And Jeremiah the prophet said unto Hananiah the prophet, 'Hear, I pray you, O Hananiah; Yahweh had not sent you, and you hast caused this people to trust on falsehood.
\v 16 Therefore thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am casting you from off the face of the ground; this year you diest, for apostasy you hast spoken concerning Yahweh.'
\v 17 And Hananiah the prophet dieth in that year, in the seventh month.
\c 29
\v 1 And these are words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the remnant of the elders of the removal, and unto the priests, and unto the prophets, and unto all the people — whom Nebuchadnezzar removed from Jerusalem to Babylon,
\v 2 After the going forth of Jeconiah the king, and the mistress, and the officers, heads of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artificer, and the smith, from Jerusalem — 
\v 3 By the hand of Eleasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah son of Hilkijah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon — to Babylon, saying,
\v 4 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, to all the removal that I removed from Jerusalem to Babylon,
\v 5 Build you houses, and abide; and plant you gardens, and eat their fruit;
\v 6 Take you wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take for your sons wives, and your daughters give to husbands, and they bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and you are not few;
\v 7 And seek the peace of the city where I have removed you, and pray for it unto Yahweh, for in its peace you have peace.
\v 8 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Let not your prophets who are in your middle, and your diviners, lift you up, nor hearken you unto their dreams, that you are causing them to dream;
\v 9 For with falsehood they are prophesying to you in My name; I have not sent them, an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 10 For thus said Yahweh, Surely at the fulness of Babylon — seventy years — I inspect you, and have established towards you My good word, to bring you back unto this place.
\v 11 For I have known the thoughts that I am thinking towards you — an affirmation of Yahweh; thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give to you posterity and hope.
\v 12 'And you have called Me, and have gone, and have prayed unto Me, and I have hearkened unto you,
\v 13 And you have sought Me, and have found, for you seek Me with all your heart;
\v 14 And I have been found of you — an affirmation of Yahweh; and I have turned back to your captivity, and have gathered you out of all the nations, and out of all the places where I have driven you — an affirmation of Yahweh — and I have brought you back unto the place whence I removed you.
\v 15 'Because you have said, Yahweh had raised up to us prophets in Babylon,
\v 16 Surely thus said Yahweh concerning the king who is sitting on the throne of David, and concerning all the people that is dwelling in this city, your brethren who went not forth with you in the removal;
\v 17 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, Lo, I am sending among them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and I have given them up as figs that are vile, that are not eaten for badness.
\v 18 And I have pursued after them with sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and have given them for a trembling to all kingdoms of the earth, for a curse and for an astonishment, and for a hissing, and for a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
\v 19 Because that they have not hearkened unto My words — an affirmation of Yahweh — that I sent unto them by My servants the prophets, rising early and sending, and you hearkened not — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 20 'And you, hear you a word of Yahweh, all you of the captivity that I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon,
\v 21 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you in My name falsehood: Lo, I am giving them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he had smitten them before your eyes,
\v 22 And taken from them had been a reviling by all the removed of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh did set you as Zedekiah, and as Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted with fire;
\v 23 Because that they have done folly in Israel, and commit adultery with the wives of their neighbours, and speak a word in My name falsely that I have not commanded them, and I am He who knoweth and a witness — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 24 'And unto Shemaiah the Nehelamite you will speak, saying,
\v 25 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, saying, Because that you hast sent in your name letters unto all the people who are in Jerusalem, and unto Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and unto all the priests, saying,
\v 26 Yahweh had made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, for there being inspectors of the house of Yahweh, for every one mad and making himself a prophet, and you hast put him unto the torture and unto the stocks.
\v 27 And now, why hast you not pushed against Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is making himself a prophet to you?
\v 28 Because that he had sent unto us to Babylon, saying, It is long, build you houses, and abide; and plant you gardens, and eat their fruit.'
\v 29 And Zephaniah the priest readeth this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
\v 30 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, saying,
\v 31 Send unto all the removal, saying, Thus said Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Because that Shemaiah prophesied to you, and I — I have not sent him, and he did cause you to trust on falsehood,
\v 32 Therefore, thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am seeing after Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and after his seed, he had none dwelling in the middle of this people, nor did he look on the good that I am doing to My people — an affirmation of Yahweh — for apostasy he had spoken against Yahweh.'
\c 30
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 'Thus spake Yahweh, God of Israel, saying, Write for you all the words that I have spoken unto you on a book.
\v 3 For, behold, days are coming — an affirmation of Yahweh — and I have turned back to the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, said Yahweh, and I have caused them to turn back unto the land that I gave to their fathers, and they do possess it.'
\v 4 And these are the words that Yahweh had spoken concerning Israel and concerning Judah:
\v 5 Surely thus said Yahweh: A voice of trembling we have heard, Fear — and there is no peace.
\v 6 Ask, I pray you, and see, is a male bringing forth? Wherefore have I seen every man, His hands on his loins, as a travailing woman, And all faces have been turned to paleness?
\v 7 Woe! for great is that day, without any like it, Yea, a time of adversity it is to Jacob, Yet out of it he is saved.
\v 8 And it had come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, I break his yoke from off your neck, And your bands I draw away, And lay no more service on him do strangers.
\v 9 And they have served Yahweh their God, And David their king whom I raise up to them.
\v 10 And you, be not afraid, My servant Jacob, An affirmation of Yahweh, Nor be frightened, O Israel, For, behold, I am saving you from afar, And your seed from the land of their captivity, And Jacob had turned back and rested, And is quiet, and there is none troubling.
\v 11 For with you am I, An affirmation of Yahweh — to save you, For I make an end of all the nations Whither I have scattered you, Only, of you I do not make an end, And I have chastised you in judgment, And do not entirely acquit you.
\v 12 For thus said Yahweh: Incurable is your breach, grievous your stroke,
\v 13 There is none judging your cause to bind up, Healing medicines there are none for you.
\v 14 all loving you have forgotten you, Thee they do not seek, For with the stroke of an enemy I smote you, The chastisement of a fierce one, Because of the abundance of your iniquity, Mighty have been your sins!
\v 15 What! — you criest concerning your breach! Incurable is your pain, Because of the abundance of your iniquity, Mighty have been your sins! I have done these to you.
\v 16 Therefore all consuming you are consumed, And all yours adversaries — all of them — Into captivity do go, And your spoilers have been for a spoil, And all your plunderers I give up to plunder.
\v 17 For I increase health to you, And from your strokes I do heal you, An affirmation of Yahweh, For 'Outcast' they have called to you, 'Zion it is, there is none seeking for her.'
\v 18 Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I turn back to the captivity of the tents of Jacob, And his dwelling places I pity, And the city had been built on its heap, And the palace according to its ordinance remaineth.
\v 19 And gone forth from them had thanksgiving, And the voice of playful ones, And I have multiplied them and they are not few, And made them honourable, and they are not small.
\v 20 And his sons have been as aforetime, And his company before Me is established, And I have seen after all his oppressors.
\v 21 And his honourable one had been of himself, And his ruler from his middle went forth, And I have caused him to draw near, And he had drawn nigh unto Me, For who is he who had pledged his heart To draw nigh unto Me? An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 22 And you have been to Me for a people, And I am to you for God.
\v 23 Lo, a whirlwind of Yahweh — Fury had gone forth — a cutting whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.
\v 24 The fierceness of the anger of Yahweh Doth not turn back till His doing, Yea, till His establishing the devices of His heart, In the latter end of the days we consider it!
\c 31
\v 1 At that time, an affirmation of Yahweh, I am for God to all families of Israel, And they — they are to Me for a people.
\v 2 Thus said Yahweh: Found grace in the wilderness Hath a people remaining from the sword Going to cause it to rest — Israel.
\v 3 From afar Yahweh had appeared to me, With love age-during I have loved you, Therefore I have drawn you with kindness.
\v 4 Again do I build you, And you hast been built, O virgin of Israel, Again you puttest on your tabrets, And hast gone out in the chorus of the playful.
\v 5 Again you will plant vineyards In mountains of Samaria, Planters have planted, and made common.
\v 6 For there is a day, Cried have watchmen on mount Ephraim, 'Rise, and we go up to Zion, unto Yahweh our God;
\v 7 For thus said Yahweh: Sing, O you to Jacob, with joy, And cry aloud at the head of the nations, Sound you, praise you, and say, Save, O Yahweh, your people, the remnant of Israel.
\v 8 Lo, I am bringing them in from the north country, And have gathered them from the sides of the earth, Among them are blind and lame, Conceiving and travailing one — together, A great assembly — they turn back hither.
\v 9 With weeping they come in, And with supplications I bring them, I cause them to go unto streams of waters, In a right way — they stumble not in it, For I have been to Israel for a father, And Ephraim — My first-born is he.
\v 10 Hear a word of Yahweh, O nations, And declare you among isles afar off, and say: He who is scattering Israel did gather him, And had kept him as a shepherd did his flock,
\v 11 For Yahweh had ransomed Jacob, And redeemed him from a hand stronger than he.
\v 12 And they have come in, And have sung in the high place of Zion, And flowed unto the goodness of Yahweh, For wheat, and for new wine, and for oil, And for the young of the flock and herd, And their soul had been as a watered garden, And they add not to grieve any more.
\v 13 Then rejoice did a virgin in a chorus, Both young men and old men — together, And I have turned their mourning to joy, And have comforted them, And gladdened them above their sorrow,
\v 14 And satisfied the soul of the priests with fatness, And My people with My goodness are satisfied, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 15 Thus said Yahweh, A voice in Ramah is heard, wailing, weeping most bitter, Rachel is weeping for her sons, She had refused to be comforted for her sons, because they are not.
\v 16 Thus said Yahweh: Withhold your voice from weeping, and yours eyes from tears, For there is a reward for your work, An affirmation of Yahweh, And they have turned back from the land of the enemy.
\v 17 And there is hope for your latter end, An affirmation of Yahweh, And the sons have turned back to their border.
\v 18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, 'You hast chastised me, And I am chastised, as a heifer not taught, Turn me back, and I turn back, For you are Yahweh my God.
\v 19 For after my turning back I repented, And after my being instructed I struck on the thigh, I have been ashamed, I have also blushed, For I have borne the reproach of my youth.
\v 20 A precious son is Ephraim to Me? A child of delights? For since My speaking against him, I do thoroughly remember him still, Therefore have My bowels been moved for him, I do greatly love him, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 21 Set up for you signs, make for you heaps, Set your heart to the highway, the way you wentest, Turn back, O virgin of Israel, Turn back unto these your cities.
\v 22 Till when will you withdraw thyself, O backsliding daughter? For Yahweh had prepared a new thing in the land, Woman did compass man.
\v 23 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Still they say this word in the land of Judah, And in its cities, In My turning back to their captivity, Yahweh did bless you, habitation of righteousness, Mountain of holiness.
\v 24 And dwelt in Judah have husbandmen, and in all its cities together, And they have journeyed in order.
\v 25 For I have satiated the weary soul, And every grieved soul I have filled.'
\v 26 On this I have awaked, and I behold, and my sleep had been sweet to me.
\v 27 Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Yahweh, And I have sown the house of Israel, And the house of Judah, With seed of man, and seed of beast.
\v 28 And it had been, as I watched over them to pluck up, And to break down, and to throw down, And to destroy, and to afflict; So do I watch over them to build, and to plant, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 29 In those days they do not say any more: Fathers have eaten unripe fruit, And the sons' teeth are blunted.
\v 30 But — each for his own iniquity did die, Every man who is eating the unripe fruit, Blunted are his teeth.
\v 31 Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Yahweh, And I have made with the house of Israel And with the house of Judah a new covenant,
\v 32 Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers, In the day of My laying hold on their hand, To bring them out of the land of Egypt, In that they made void My covenant, And I ruled over them — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 33 For this is the covenant that I make, With the house of Israel, after those days, An affirmation of Yahweh, I have given My law in their inward part, And on their heart I do write it, And I have been to them for God, And they are to me for a people.
\v 34 And they do not teach any more Each his neighbour, and each his brother, Saying, Know you Yahweh, For they all know Me, from their least unto their greatest, An affirmation of Yahweh; For I pardon their iniquity, And of their sin I make mention no more.
\v 35 Thus said Yahweh, Who is giving the sun for a light by day, The statutes of moon and stars for a light by night, Quieting the sea when its billows roar, Yahweh of Hosts is His name:
\v 36 If these statutes depart from before Me, An affirmation of Yahweh, Even the seed of Israel did cease From being a nation before Me all the days.
\v 37 Thus said Yahweh: If the heavens above be measured, And the foundations of earth below searched, Even I kick against all the seed of Israel, For all that they have done, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 38 Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Yahweh, And the city had been built to Yahweh, From the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.
\v 39 And gone out again had the measuring line Over-against it, unto the height of Gareb, And it had compassed to Goah.
\v 40 And all the valley of the carcases and of the ashes, And all the fields unto the brook Kidron, Unto the corner of the horse-gate eastward, Are holy to Yahweh, it is not plucked up, Nor is it thrown down any more to the age!
\c 32
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah — it is the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar,
\v 2 And then the forces of the king of Babylon are laying siege against Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet had been shut up in the court of the prison that is in the house of the king of Judah,
\v 3 Where Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, 'Wherefore are you prophesying, saying, Thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he had captured it;
\v 4 And Zedekiah king of Judah did not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but is certainly given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and his mouth had spoken with his mouth, and his eyes see his eyes,
\v 5 And to Babylon he leadeth Zedekiah, and there he is till My inspecting him, — an affirmation of Yahweh — because you fight with the Chaldeans, you do not prosper.'
\v 6 And Jeremiah said, 'A word of Yahweh had been unto me saying,
\v 7 Lo, Hanameel son of Shallum, yours uncle, is coming unto you, saying, Buy for you my field that is in Anathoth, for yours is the right of redemption — to buy.
\v 8 And Hanameel, my uncle's son, came in unto me, according to the word of Yahweh, unto the court of the prison, and said unto me, 'Buy, I pray you, my field that is in Anathoth, that is in the land of Benjamin, for yours is the right of possession, and yours of redemption — buy for you.' And I know that it is the word of Yahweh,
\v 9 And I buy the field, that is in Anathoth, from Hanameel, my uncle's son, and I weigh to him the money — seventeen shekels of silver.
\v 10 And I write in a book, and seal, and cause witnesses to testify, and weigh the silver in balances;
\v 11 And I take the purchase-book, the sealed one, according to law and custom, and the open one.
\v 12 And I give the purchase-book unto Baruch son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel, my uncle's son, and before the eyes of the witnesses, those writing in the purchase-book, before the eyes of all the Jews who are sitting in the court of the prison.
\v 13 And I charge Baruch before their eyes, saying,
\v 14 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Take these books, this purchase-book, both the sealed one and the open one, and you hast put them in an earthen vessel, that they may remain many days;
\v 15 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Again are houses and fields and vineyards bought in this land.'
\v 16 And I pray unto Yahweh — after my giving the purchase-book unto Baruch son of Neriah — saying,
\v 17 'Ah, Lord Yahweh, behold, You hast made the heavens and the earth by Your great power, and by Your stretched-out arm; there is nothing too wonderful for Thee:
\v 18 Doing kindness to thousands, and recompensing iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their sons after them; God, the great, the mighty, Yahweh of Hosts is His name,
\v 19 Great in counsel, and mighty in act, in that Thine eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of Adam, to give to each according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
\v 20 In that you hast done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt unto this day, and in Israel, and among men, and You will make for Thee a name as at this day.
\v 21 'And You bringest forth Your people Israel from the land of Egypt, with signs and with wonders, and by a strong hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great fear,
\v 22 And you givest to them this land that you did swear to their fathers to give to them, a land flowing with milk and honey,
\v 23 And they come in, and possess it, and they have not hearkened to Your voice, and in Your law have not walked, all that which You did lay a charge on them to do they have not done, and You will proclaim to them all this evil.
\v 24 Lo, the mounts — they have come in to the city to capture it, and the city had been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence; and that which You hast spoken had come to pass, and behold, You are seeing;
\v 25 Yet You hast said unto me, O Lord Yahweh, Buy for you the field with money, and cause witnesses to testify — and the city had been given into the hand of the Chaldeans!'
\v 26 And the word of Yahweh is unto Jeremiah, saying:
\v 27 Lo, I am Yahweh, God of all flesh: For Me is anything too wonderful?
\v 28 'Therefore, thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he had captured it;
\v 29 And come in have the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city, and they have set this city on fire, and have burned it, and the houses on whose roofs they made perfume to Baal, and poured out libations to other gods, so as to provoke Me to anger.
\v 30 For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been only doing evil in Mine eyes, from their youth; for the sons of Israel are only provoking Me with the work of their hands — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 31 For a cause of Mine anger, and a cause of My fury, had this city been to Me, even from the day that they built it, and unto this day — to turn it aside from before My face,
\v 32 Because of all the evil of the sons of Israel, and of the sons of Judah that they have done, so as to provoke Me — they, their kings, their heads, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 33 And they turn unto Me the neck, and not the face, and teaching them, rising early and teaching, and they are not hearkening to accept instruction.
\v 34 'And they set their abominations in the house over which My name is called, so as to defile it;
\v 35 And they build the high places of Baal, that are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come up on my heart to do this abomination, so as to cause Judah to sin.
\v 36 'And now, therefore, thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, concerning this city, of which you are saying, It had been given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, and by famine, and by pestilence,
\v 37 Lo, I am gathering them out of all the lands where I have driven them in Mine anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath, and I have brought them back unto this place, and have caused them to dwell confidently;
\v 38 and they have been to Me for a people, and I am to them for God;
\v 39 and I have given to them one heart, and one way, to fear Me all the days, for good to them, and to their sons after them:
\v 40 and I have made for them a covenant age-during, in that I turn not back from after them for My doing them good, and My fear I put in their heart, so as not to turn aside from me;
\v 41 and I have rejoiced over them to do them good, and have planted them in this land in truth, with all my heart, and with all My soul.
\v 42 'For thus said Yahweh: As I brought in unto this people all this great evil, so I am bringing in on them all the good that I am speaking concerning them;
\v 43 and bought had been the field in this land of which you are saying, A desolation it is, without man and beast, it had been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 44 Fields with money they buy, so as to write in a book, and to seal, and to cause witnesses to testify, in the land of Benjamin, and in suburbs of Jerusalem, and in cities of Judah, and in cities of the hill-country, and in cities of the low country, and in cities of the south, for I turn back their captivity — an affirmation of Yahweh.'
\c 33
\v 1 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah a second time — and he is yet detained in the court of the prison — saying:
\v 2 Thus said Yahweh its maker, Yahweh its former, at establishing it, Yahweh is His name:
\v 3 Call unto Me, and I do answer you, yea, I declare to you great and fenced things — you hast not known them.
\v 4 For thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that are broken down for the mounts, and for the tool;
\v 5 they are coming in to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the carcases of men, whom I have smitten in Mine anger, and in My fury, and for whom I have hidden My face from this city, because of all their evil:
\v 6 Lo, I am increasing to it health and cure, And have healed them, and revealed to them The abundance of peace and truth.
\v 7 And I have turned back the captivity of Judah, And the captivity of Israel, And I have built them as at the first,
\v 8 And cleansed them from all their iniquity, That they have sinned against Me, And I have pardoned all their iniquities, That they have sinned against Me, And that they transgressed against Me.
\v 9 And it had been to Me for a name of joy, For praise, and for beauty, to all nations of the earth, Who hear of all the good that I am doing them, And they have feared, And they have trembled for all the good, And for all the peace, that I am doing to it.
\v 10 Thus said Yahweh: Again heard in this place of which you are saying, Waste it is, without man and without beast, In cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, That are desolated, without man, And without inhabitant, and without beast,
\v 11 Is a voice of joy and a voice of gladness, Voice of bridegroom, and voice of bride, The voice of those saying, Thank Yahweh of Hosts, for Yahweh is good, For His kindness is to the age, Who are bringing in thanksgiving to the house of Yahweh, For I turn back the captivity of the land, As at the first, said Yahweh.
\v 12 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Again there is in this place — that is waste, Without man and beast, And in all its cities — a habitation of shepherds, Causing the flock to lie down.
\v 13 In the cities of the hill-country, In the cities of the low country, And in the cities of the south, And in the land of Benjamin, And in the suburbs of Jerusalem, And in the cities of Judah, Again did the flock pass by under the hands of the numberer, said Yahweh.
\v 14 Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Yahweh, And I have established the good word That I spake unto the house of Israel, And concerning the house of Judah.
\v 15 In those days, and at that time, I cause to shoot up to David a shoot of righteousness, And he had done judgment and righteousness in the earth.
\v 16 In those days is Judah saved, And Jerusalem did dwell confidently, And this is he whom Yahweh proclaimeth to her: 'Our Righteousness.'
\v 17 For thus said Yahweh: 'Not cut off to David is one sitting on the throne of the house of Israel,
\v 18 And to the priests — the Levites, Not cut off from before Me is one, Causing a burnt-offering to ascend, And perfuming a present, and making sacrifice — all the days.'
\v 19 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, saying,
\v 20 'Thus said Yahweh: If you do break My covenant of the day, And My covenant of the night, So that they are not daily and nightly in their season,
\v 21 Also My covenant is broken with David My servant, So that he had not a son reigning on his throne, And with the Levites the priests, My ministers.
\v 22 As the host of the heavens is not numbered, Nor the sand of the sea measured, So I multiply the seed of David My servant, And the Levites My ministers.'
\v 23 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, saying:
\v 24 Hast you not considered what this people have spoken, saying: The two families on which Yahweh fixed, He did reject them, And my people they despise — So that they are no more a people before them!
\v 25 Thus said Yahweh: If My covenant is not daily and nightly, The statutes of heaven and earth I have not appointed — 
\v 26 Also the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, I reject, Against taking from his seed rulers For the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, For I turn back to their captivity, and have pitied them.'
\c 34
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh — and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his force, and all kingdoms of the land of the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples are fighting against Jerusalem, and against all its cities — saying:
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel: Go, and you hast spoken unto Zedekiah king of Judah, and hast said unto him, Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he had burned it with fire,
\v 3 and you, you will not escape out of his hand, for you are certainly caught, and into his hand you are given, and yours eyes see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth with your mouth spoke, and Babylon you enterest.
\v 4 'Only, hear a word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah king of Judah, Thus said Yahweh unto you: You will not die by sword,
\v 5 in peace you diest, and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who have been before you, so they make a burning for you; and Ah, lord, they lament for you, for the word I have spoken — an affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 6 And Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Zedekiah king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem,
\v 7 and the forces of the king of Babylon are fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that are left — against Lachish, and against Azekah, for these have been left among the cities of Judah, cities of fortresses.
\v 8 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, after the making by the king Zedekiah of a covenant with all the people who are in Jerusalem, to proclaim to them liberty,
\v 9 to send out each his man-servant, and each his maid-servant — the Hebrew and the Hebrewess — free, so as not to lay service on them, any on a Jew his brother;
\v 10 and hearken do all the heads, and all the people who have come in to the covenant to send forth each his man-servant and each his maid-servant free, so as not to lay service on them any more, yea, they hearken, and send them away;
\v 11 and they turn afterwards, and cause the men-servants and the maid-servants to return, whom they had sent forth free, and they subdue them for men-servants and for maid-servants.
\v 12 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying:
\v 13 Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, I — I made a covenant with your fathers in the day of My bringing them forth from the land of Egypt, from a house of servants, saying,
\v 14 At the end of seven years you do send forth each his brother, the Hebrew, who is sold to you, and had served you six years, yea, you hast sent him forth free from you: and your fathers hearkened not unto Me, nor inclined their ear.
\v 15 'And you turn back, you to-day, and you do that which is right in Mine eyes, to proclaim liberty each to his neighbour, and you make a covenant before Me in the house over which My name is called.
\v 16 And — you turn back, and pollute My name, and you cause each his man-servant and each his maid-servant, whom he had sent forth free, (at their pleasure,) to return, and you subdue them to be to you for men-servants and for maid-servants.
\v 17 Therefore, thus said Yahweh: Ye have not hearkened unto Me to proclaim freedom, each to his brother, and each to his neighbour; behold, I am proclaiming to you liberty — an affirmation of Yahweh — unto the sword, unto the pestilence, and unto the famine, and I have given you for a trembling to all kingdoms of the earth.
\v 18 And I have given the men who are transgressing My covenant, who have not established the words of the covenant that they have made before Me, by the calf, that they have cut in two, and pass through between its pieces — 
\v 19 heads of Judah, and heads of Jerusalem, the officers, and the priests, and all the people of the land those passing through between the pieces of the calf — 
\v 20 yea, I have given them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those seeking their soul, and their carcase had been for food to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the earth.
\v 21 'And Zedekiah king of Judah, and his heads, I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those seeking their soul, and into the hand of the forces of the king of Babylon, that are going up from off you.
\v 22 Lo, I am commanding — an affirmation of Yahweh — and have brought them back unto this city, and they have fought against it, and captured it, and burned it with fire, and the cities of Judah I do make a desolation — without inhabitant.'
\c 35
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:
\v 2 'Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and you hast spoken with them, and brought them into the house of Yahweh, unto one of the chambers, and caused them to drink wine.'
\v 3 And I take Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and all the house of the Rechabites,
\v 4 and bring them into the house of Yahweh, unto the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, that is near to the chamber of the princes, that is above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold;
\v 5 and I put before the sons of the house of the Rechabites goblets full of wine, and cups, and I say unto them, Drink you wine.
\v 6 And they say, 'We do not drink wine: for Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, charged us, saying, Ye do not drink wine, you and your sons — unto the age;
\v 7 and a house you do not build, and seed you do not sow, and a vineyard you do not plant, nor have you any; for in tents do you dwell all your days, that you may live many days on the face of the ground where you are sojourning.
\v 8 'And we hearken to the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, to all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters;
\v 9 nor to build houses for our dwelling; and vineyard, and field, and seed, we have none;
\v 10 and we dwell in tents, and we hearken, and we do according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us;
\v 11 and it came to pass, in the coming up of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon unto the land, that we say, Come, and we enter Jerusalem, because of the force of the Chaldeans, and because of the force of Aram — and we dwell in Jerusalem.'
\v 12 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, saying: 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel:
\v 13 Go, and you hast said to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Do you not receive instruction? — to hearken unto My words — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 14 Performed have been the words of Jonadab son of Rechab, when he commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk unto this day, for they have obeyed the command of their father; and I — I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking, and you have not hearkened unto Me.
\v 15 And I send unto you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying: Turn back, I pray you, each from his evil way, and amend your doings, yea, you do not walk after other gods, to serve them, and dwell you on the ground that I have given to you and to your fathers; and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto Me.
\v 16 'Because the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have performed the command of their father, that he commanded them, and this people have not hearkened unto Me,
\v 17 therefore thus said Yahweh, God of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am bringing in unto Judah, and unto all inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil that I have spoken against them, because I have spoken unto them, and they have not hearkened, yea, I call to them, and they have not answered.'
\v 18 And to the house of the Rechabites said Jeremiah: 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Because that you have hearkened unto the command of Jonadab your father, and you observe all his commands, and do according to all that he commanded you;
\v 19 therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Of Jonadab son of Rechab one standing before me is not cut off all the days.'
\c 36
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying:
\v 2 'Take to you a roll of a book, and you hast written on it all the words that I have spoken unto you concerning Israel, and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I spake unto you, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day;
\v 3 if so be the house of Israel do hear all the evil that I am thinking of doing to them, so that they turn back each from is evil way, and I have been propitious to their iniquity, and to their sin.'
\v 4 And Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch writeth from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh, that He had spoken unto him, on a roll of a book.
\v 5 And Jeremiah commandeth Baruch, saying, 'I am restrained, I am not able to enter the house of Yahweh;
\v 6 but you hast entered — and you hast read in the roll that you hast written from my mouth, the words of Yahweh, in the ears of the people, in the house of Yahweh, in the day of the fast, and also in the ears of all Judah who are coming in from their cities you will read them;
\v 7 if so be their supplication did fall before Yahweh, and they turn back each from his evil way, for great is the anger and the fury that Yahweh had spoken concerning this people.'
\v 8 And Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, to read in the book the words of Yahweh in the house of Yahweh.
\v 9 And it came to pass, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh have all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who are coming in from cities of Judah to Jerusalem;
\v 10 and Baruch readeth in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the opening of the new gate of the house of Yahweh, in the ears of all the people.
\v 11 And Michaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heareth all the words of Yahweh from off the book,
\v 12 and he went down to the house of the king, unto the chamber of the scribe, and behold, there are all the heads sitting: Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan son of Acbor, and Gemariah son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the heads.
\v 13 And declare to them did Micaiah all the words that he had heard, when Baruch readeth in the book in the ears of the people;
\v 14 and all the heads send unto Baruch, Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, 'The roll in which you hast read in the ears of the people take in your hand, and come.' And Baruch son of Neriah took the roll in his hand and came in unto them,
\v 15 and they say unto him, 'Sit down, we pray you, and read it in our ears,' and Baruch readeth in their ears,
\v 16 and it came to pass, when they hear all the words, they have been afraid one at another, and say unto Baruch, 'We do surely declare to the king all these words.'
\v 17 And they asked Baruch, saying, 'Declare, we pray you, to us, how did you write all these words — from his mouth?'
\v 18 And Baruch said to them, 'From his mouth, he pronounceth unto me all these words, and I am writing on the book with ink.'
\v 19 And the heads say unto Baruch, 'Go, be hidden, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.'
\v 20 And they go in unto the king, to the court, and the roll they have laid up in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they declare in the ears of the king all the words.
\v 21 And the king sent Jehudi to take the roll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and Jehudi readeth it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the heads who are standing by the king;
\v 22 and the king is sitting in the winter-house, in the ninth month, and the stove before him is burning,
\v 23 and it came to pass, when Jehudi readeth three or four leaves, he cutteth it out with the scribe's knife, and had cast unto the fire, that is on the stove, till the consumption of all the roll by the fire that is on the stove.
\v 24 And the king and all his servants who are hearing all these words have not been afraid, nor rent their garments.
\v 25 And also Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah have interceded with the king not to burn the roll, and he had not hearkened unto them.
\v 26 And the king commandeth Jerahmeel son of Hammelek, and Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Yahweh did hide them.
\v 27 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah — after the king's burning the roll, even the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremiah — saying:
\v 28 'Turn, take to you another roll, and write on it all the former words that were on the first roll, that Jehoiakim king of Judah burnt,
\v 29 and unto Jehoiakim king of Judah you will say: Thus said Yahweh, You hast burnt this roll, saying, Wherefore hast you written on it, saying, The king of Babylon surely came in, and had destroyed this land, and caused to cease from it man and beast?
\v 30 'Therefore, thus said Yahweh, concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He had none sitting on the throne of David, and his carcase is cast out to heat by day, and to cold by night;
\v 31 and I have charged on him, and on his seed, and on his servants, their iniquity; and I have brought in on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken unto them, and they hearkened not.'
\v 32 And Jeremiah had taken another roll, and gave it unto Baruch son of Neriah the scribe, and he writeth on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burnt in the fire; and again there were added unto them many words like these.
\c 37
\v 1 And reign did king Zedekiah son of Josiah instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had caused to reign in the land of Judah,
\v 2 and he had not hearkened, he, and his servants, and the people of the land, unto the words of Yahweh, that He spake by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
\v 3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 'Pray, we beseech you, for us unto Yahweh our God.'
\v 4 And Jeremiah is coming in and going out in the middle of the people, (and they have not put him in the prison-house),
\v 5 and the force of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who are laying siege against Jerusalem, hear their report, and go up from off Jerusalem.
\v 6 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
\v 7 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Thus do you say unto the king of Judah, who is sending you unto Me, to seek Me: Lo, the force of Pharaoh that is coming out to you for help had turned back to its land, to Egypt,
\v 8 and the Chaldeans have turned back, and fought against this city, and captured it, and burnt it with fire.
\v 9 'Thus said Yahweh: Lift not up your souls saying, The Chaldeans surely go from off us, for they do not go;
\v 10 for though you had smitten all the force of the Chaldeans who are fighting with you, and there were left of them wounded men — each in his tent — they rise, and have burnt this city with fire.'
\v 11 And it had come to pass, in the going up of the force of the Chaldeans from off Jerusalem, because of the force of Pharaoh,
\v 12 that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin, to receive a portion there in the middle of the people.
\v 13 And it came to pass, he is at the gate of Benjamin, and there is a master of the ward — and his name is Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah — and he catcheth Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 'Unto the Chaldeans you are falling.'
\v 14 And Jeremiah said, 'Falsehood — I am not falling unto the Chaldeans;' and he had not hearkened unto him, and Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him in unto the heads,
\v 15 and the heads are wroth against Jeremiah, and have smitten him, and put him in the prison-house — the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it they had made for a prison-house.
\v 16 When Jeremiah had entered into the house of the dungeon, and unto the cells, then Jeremiah dwelleth there many days,
\v 17 and the king Zedekiah sent, and took him, and the king asketh him in his house in secret, and said, 'Is there a word from Yahweh?' And Jeremiah said, 'There is,' and he said, 'Into the hand of the king of Babylon you are given.'
\v 18 And Jeremiah said unto the king Zedekiah, 'What have I sinned against you, and against your servants, and against this people, that you have given me unto a prison-house?
\v 19 And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon did not come in against you, and against this land?
\v 20 And now, hearken, I pray you, my lord, O king, let my supplication fall, I pray you, before you, and cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I die not there.'
\v 21 And the king Zedekiah commandeth, and they commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, also to give to him a cake of bread daily from the bakers' street, till the consumption of all the bread of the city, and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison.
\c 38
\v 1 And Shephatiah son of Mattan, and Gedaliah son of Pashhur, and Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah, hear the words that Jeremiah is speaking unto all the people, saying,
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh: He who is remaining in this city dieth, by sword, by famine, and by pestilence, and he who is going forth unto the Chaldeans lived, and his soul had been to him for a prey, and he lived.
\v 3 Thus said Yahweh: This city is certainly given into the hand of the force of the king of Babylon, and he had captured it.'
\v 4 And the heads say unto the king, 'Let, we pray you, this man be put to death, because that he is making feeble the hands of the men of war, who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking unto them according to these words, for this man is not seeking for the peace of this people, but for its evil.'
\v 5 And the king Zedekiah said, 'Lo, he is in your hand: for the king is not able for you in anything.'
\v 6 And they take Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of Malchiah son of the king, that is in the court of the prison, and they send down Jeremiah with cords; and in the pit there is no water, but mire, and Jeremiah sinketh in the mire.
\v 7 And Ebed-Melech the Cushite, a eunuch who is in the king's house, heareth that they have put Jeremiah into the pit; and the king is sitting at the gate of Benjamin,
\v 8 and Ebed-Melech went forth from the king's house, and spoke unto the king, saying,
\v 9 My lord, O king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the pit, and he dieth in his place because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.'
\v 10 And the king commandeth Ebed-Melech the Cushite, saying, 'Take with you from this thirty men, and you hast brought up Jeremiah the prophet from the pit, before he dieth.'
\v 11 And Ebed-Melech took the men with him, and entereth the house of the king, unto the place of the treasury, and took there worn-out clouts, and worn-out rags, and sent them unto Jeremiah unto the pit by cords.
\v 12 And Ebed-Melech the Cushite said unto Jeremiah, 'Put, I pray you, the worn-out clouts and rags under yours arm-holes, at the place of the cords,' and Jeremiah did so,
\v 13 and they draw out Jeremiah with cords, and bring him up out of the pit, and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison.
\v 14 And the king Zedekiah sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him, unto the third entrance that is in the house of Yahweh, and the king said unto Jeremiah, 'I am asking you a thing, do not hide from me anything.'
\v 15 And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, 'When I declare to you, will you not surely put me to death? and when I counsel you, you will not hearken unto me.'
\v 16 And the king Zedekiah sweareth unto Jeremiah in secret, saying, 'Yahweh lived, He who made for us this soul, I do not put you to death, nor give you unto the hand of these men who are seeking your soul.'
\v 17 And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Hosts, God of Israel: If you will certainly go forth unto the heads of the king of Babylon, then had your soul lived, and this city is not burned with fire, yea, you hast lived, you and your house.
\v 18 And if you will not go forth unto the heads of the king of Babylon, then had this city been given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they have burnt it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.'
\v 19 And the king Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah, 'I am fearing the Jews who have fallen unto the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand, and they have insulted me.'
\v 20 And Jeremiah said, 'They do not give you up; hearken, I pray you, to the voice of Yahweh, to that which I am speaking unto you, and it is well for you, and your soul did live.
\v 21 And if you are refusing to go forth, this is the thing that Yahweh had shewn me:
\v 22 That, behold, all the women who have been left in the house of the king of Judah are brought forth unto the heads of the king of Babylon, and behold, they are saying: Persuaded you, and prevailed against you, Have yours allies, Sunk into mire have your feet, They have been turned backward.
\v 23 'And all your wives, and your sons, are brought forth unto the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, for by the hand of the king of Babylon you are caught, and this city is burnt with fire.'
\v 24 And Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah, 'Let no man know of these words, and you will not die;
\v 25 and when the heads hear that I have spoken with you, and they have come in unto you, and have said unto you, Declare to us, we pray you, what you did speak unto the king, do not hide it from us, and we do not put you to death, and what the king spake unto you,
\v 26 then you hast said unto them, I am causing my supplication to fall before the king, not to cause me to return to the house of Jonathan, to die there.'
\v 27 And all the heads come in unto Jeremiah, and ask him, and he declareth to them according to all these words that the king commanded, and they keep silent from him, for the matter was not heard;
\v 28 and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison till the day that Jerusalem had been captured, and he was there when Jerusalem was captured.
\c 39
\v 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, come had Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his force unto Jerusalem, and they lay siege against it;
\v 2 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, had the city been broken up;
\v 3 and come in do all the heads of the king of Babylon, and they sit at the middle gate, Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, chief of the eunuchs, Nergal-Sharezer, chief of the Mages, and all the rest of the heads of the king of Babylon.
\v 4 And it came to pass, when Zedekiah king of Judah, and all the men of war, have seen them, that they flee and go forth by night from the city, the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and he went forth the way of the plain.
\v 5 And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after them, and overtake Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and they take him, and bring him up unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he spoke with him — judgments.
\v 6 And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah, in Riblah, before his eyes, yea, all the freemen of Judah had the king of Babylon slaughtered.
\v 7 And the eyes of Zedekiah he had blinded, and he bindeth him with brazen fetters, to bring him in to Babylon.
\v 8 And the house of the king, and the house of the people, have the Chaldeans burnt with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem they have broken down.
\v 9 And the remnant of the people who are left in the city, and those falling who have fallen to him, and the remnant of the people who are left, had Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, removed to Babylon.
\v 10 And of the poor people, who have nothing, had Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, left in the land of Judah, and he gave to them vineyards and fields on the same day.
\v 11 And Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave a charge concerning Jeremiah, by the hand of Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, saying,
\v 12 'Take him, and place yours eyes upon him, and do no evil thing to him, but as he spoke unto you, so do with him.'
\v 13 And Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners sent, and Nebushazban, chief of the eunuchs, and Nergal-Sharezer, chief of the Mages, and all the chiefs of the king of Babylon;
\v 14 yea, they send and take Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and give him unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to carry him home, and he dwelleth in the middle of the people.
\v 15 And unto Jeremiah had a word of Yahweh been — in his being detained in the court of the prison — saying:
\v 16 'Go, and you hast spoken to Ebed-Melech the Cushite, saying: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am bringing in My words unto this city for evil, and not for good, and they have been before you in that day.
\v 17 And I have delivered you in that day — an affirmation of Yahweh — and you are not given into the hand of the men of whose face you are afraid,
\v 18 for I do certainly deliver you, and by sword you fallest not, and your life had been to you for a spoil, for you hast trusted in Me — an affirmation of Yahweh.'
\c 40
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, had sent him from Ramah, in his taking him — and he a prisoner in chains — in the middle of all the removal of Jerusalem and of Judah, who are removed to Babylon.
\v 2 And the chief of the executioners took Jeremiah, and said unto him, 'Yahweh your God had spoken this evil concerning this place,
\v 3 and Yahweh brought it in, and did as He spake, because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not hearkened to His voice, even this thing had been to you.
\v 4 And now, behold, I have loosed you to-day from the chains that are on your hand; if good in yours eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I keep mine eye upon you: and if evil in yours eyes to come with me to Babylon, forbear; see, all the land is before you, where it be good, and where it be right in yours eyes to go — go.' — 
\v 5 and while he did not reply — 'Or turn back unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the middle of the people, or wheresoever it is right in yours eyes to go — go.' And the chief of the executioners gave to him for the way, and a gift, and sent him away,
\v 6 and Jeremiah came in unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelleth with him, in the middle of the people who are left in the land.
\v 7 And all the heads of the forces that are in the field hear, they and their men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land, and that he had charged him with men, and women, and infants, and of the poor of the land, of those who have not been removed to Babylon;
\v 8 and they come in unto Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, and Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophadite, and Jezaniah son of the Maachadite, they and their men.
\v 9 And swear to them did Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and to their men, saying, 'Be not afraid of serving the Chaldeans, abide in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it is well for you;
\v 10 and I, behold, I am dwelling in Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who are come in unto us, and you, gather you wine, and summer fruit, and oil, and put in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.'
\v 11 And also all the Jews who are in Moab, and among the sons of Ammon, and in Edom, and who are in all the lands, have heard that the king of Babylon had given a remnant to Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
\v 12 and all the Jews from all the places where they have been driven, turn back and enter the land of Judah, unto Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and they gather wine and summer fruit — very much.
\v 13 And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces that are in the field, have come in unto Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\v 14 and they say unto him, 'Dost you really know that Baalis king of the sons of Ammon had sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to smite your soul?' And Gedaliah son of Ahikam had not given to them credence.
\v 15 And Johanan son of Kareah had spoken unto Gedaliah in secret, in Mizpah, saying, 'Let me go, I pray you, and I smite Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one did know; why did he smite your soul? and scattered have been all Judah who are gathered unto you, and perished had the remnant of Judah.'
\v 16 And Gedaliah son of Ahikam said unto Johanan son of Kareah, 'You will not do this thing, for falsehood you are speaking concerning Ishmael.'
\c 41
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the seventh month, come had Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and of the chiefs of the king, and ten men with him, unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and they eat there bread together in Mizpah.
\v 2 And Ishmael son of Nethaniah riseth, and the ten men who have been with him, and they smite Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and he putteth him to death whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
\v 3 And all the Jews who have been with him, with Gedaliah, in Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who have been found there — the men of war — had Ishmael smitten.
\v 4 And it came to pass, on the second day of the putting of Gedaliah to death, (and no one had known,)
\v 5 that men come in from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria — eighty men — with shaven beards, and rent garments, and cutting themselves, and an offering and frankincense in their hand, to bring in to the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went forth to meet them, from Mizpah, going on and weeping, and it came to pass, at meeting them, that he said unto them, 'Come in unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam.'
\v 7 And it came to pass, at their coming in unto the middle of the city, that Ishmael son of Nethaniah did slaughter them, at the middle of the pit, he and the men who are with him.
\v 8 And ten men have been found among them, and they say unto Ishmael, 'Do not put us to death, for we have things hidden in the field — wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey.' And he forbeareth, and had not put them to death in the middle of their brethren.
\v 9 And the pit where Ishmael had cast all the carcases of the men whom he had smitten along with Gedaliah, is that which the king Asa made because of Baasha king of Israel — it had Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled with the pierced.
\v 10 And Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who are in Mizpah, the daughters of the king, and all the people who are left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, had committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, and Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive, and went to pass over unto the sons of Ammon.
\v 11 And hear did Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces that are with him, of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,
\v 12 and they take all the men, and go to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and they find him at the great waters that are in Gibeon.
\v 13 And it came to pass, when all the people who are with Ishmael see Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces who are with him, that they rejoice.
\v 14 And all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turn round, yea, they turn back, and go unto Johanan son of Kareah.
\v 15 And Ishmael son of Nethaniah had escaped, with eight men, from the presence of Johanan, and he went unto the sons of Ammon.
\v 16 And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces who are with him, take all the remnant of the people whom he had brought back from Ishmael son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah — after he had smitten Gedaliah son of Ahikam — mighty ones, men of war, and women, and infants, and eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon,
\v 17 and they go and abide in the habitations of Chimham, that are near Beth-Lehem, to go to enter Egypt,
\v 18 from the presence of the Chaldeans, for they have been afraid of them, for Ishmael son of Nethaniah had smitten Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
\c 42
\v 1 And they come nigh — all the heads of the forces, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest — 
\v 2 and they say unto Jeremiah the prophet, 'Let, we pray you, our supplication fall before you, and pray for us unto Yahweh your God, for all this remnant; for we have been left a few out of many, as yours eyes do see us;
\v 3 and Yahweh your God did declare to us the way in which we walk, and the thing that we do.'
\v 4 And Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, 'I have heard: behold, I am praying unto Yahweh your God according to your words, and it had come to pass, the whole word that Yahweh answereth you, I declare to you — I do not withhold from you a word.'
\v 5 And they have said to Jeremiah, 'Yahweh is against us for a witness true and faithful, if — according to all the word with which Yahweh your God did send you unto us — we do not so.
\v 6 Whether good or evil, to the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, we do hearken; because it is good for us when we hearken to the voice of Yahweh our God.'
\v 7 And it came to pass, at the end of ten days, that there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah,
\v 8 and he called unto Johanan son of Kareah, and unto all the heads of the forces that are with him, and to all the people, from the least even unto the greatest,
\v 9 and he said unto them, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, unto whom you sent me, to cause your supplication to fall before Him:
\v 10 'If you do certainly dwell in this land, then I have builded you up, and I throw not down; and I have planted you, and I pluck not up; for I have repented concerning the evil that I have done to you.
\v 11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are afraid of; be not afraid of him — an affirmation of Yahweh — for with you am I, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\v 12 And I give to you mercies, and he had pitied you, and caused you to turn back unto your own ground.
\v 13 And if you are saying, We do not dwell in this land — not to hearken to the voice of Yahweh your God,
\v 14 saying, No; but the land of Egypt we enter, that we see no war, and the sound of a trumpet do not hear, and for bread be not hungry; and there do we dwell.
\v 15 And now, therefore, hear you a word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: If you really set your faces to enter Egypt, and have gone in to sojourn there,
\v 16 then it had come to pass, the sword that you are afraid of, did there overtake you, in the land of Egypt; and the hunger, because of which you are sorrowful, did there cleave after you in Egypt, and there you die.
\v 17 Thus are all the men who have set their faces to enter Egypt to sojourn there; they die — by sword, by hunger, and by pestilence, and there is not to them a remnant and an escaped one, because of the evil that I am bringing in upon them;
\v 18 for thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: As poured out had been Mine anger and My fury on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so poured out is My fury upon you in your entering Egypt, and you have been for an execration, and for an astonishment, and for a reviling, and for a reproach, and you do not see any more this place.
\v 19 'Yahweh had spoken against you, O remnant of Judah, do not enter Egypt: know certainly that I have testified against you to-day;
\v 20 for you have showed yourselves perverse in your souls, for you sent me unto Yahweh your God, saying, Pray for us unto Yahweh our God, and according to all that Yahweh our God said, so declare to us, and we have done it;
\v 21 and I declare to you to-day, and you have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh your God, and to anything with which He had sent me unto you.
\v 22 And now, know you certainly that by sword, by famine, and by pestilence you die, in the place that you have desired to go in to sojourn there.'
\c 43
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Jeremiah did finish to speak unto all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him unto them — all these words — 
\v 2 that Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the proud men, speak unto Jeremiah, saying, 'Falsehood you are speaking; Yahweh our God had not sent you to say, Do not enter Egypt to sojourn there;
\v 3 for Baruch son of Neriah is moving you against us, in order to give us up into the hand of the Chaldeans, to put us to death, and to remove us to Babylon.'
\v 4 And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces, and all the people, have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, to dwell in the land of Judah;
\v 5 and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces, take all the remnant of Judah who have turned from all the nations where they were driven to sojourn in the land of Judah,
\v 6 the men, and the women, and the infant, and the daughters of the king, and every person that Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah,
\v 7 and they enter the land of Egypt, for they have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, and they enter unto Tahpanhes.
\v 8 And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
\v 9 Take in your hand great stones, and you hast hidden them, in the clay, in the brick-kiln, that is at the opening of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah,
\v 10 and you hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: 'Lo, I am sending, and I have taken Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have set his throne above these stones that I have hid, and he had stretched out his pavilion over them,
\v 11 and he had come, and smitten the land of Egypt — those who are for death to death, and those who are for captivity to captivity, and those who are for the sword to the sword.
\v 12 And I have kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and it had burned them, and he had taken them captive, and covered himself with the land of Egypt, as cover himself did the shepherd with his garment, and he had gone forth there in peace;
\v 13 and he had broken the standing pillars of the house of the sun, that is in the land of Egypt, and the houses of the gods of Egypt he did burn with fire.'
\c 44
\v 1 The word that had been unto Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who are dwelling in the land of Egypt — who are dwelling in Migdol, and in Tahpanhes, and in Noph, and in the land of Pathros — saying,
\v 2 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Ye — you have seen all the evil that I have brought in on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah, and behold, they are a waste this day, and there is none dwelling in them,
\v 3 because of their wickedness that they have done, by provoking Me to anger, by going to make perfume, by serving other gods, that they knew not, they, you, and your fathers.
\v 4 And I send unto you all my servants, the prophets, rising early and sending, saying: I pray you, do not this abomination that I have hated — 
\v 5 and they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, to turn back from their wickedness, not to make perfume to other gods,
\v 6 and poured out is My fury, and Mine anger, and it burneth in cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, and they are for a waste, for a desolation, as at this day.
\v 7 'And, now, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Why are you doing great evil unto your own souls, to cut off to you man and woman, infant and suckling, from the middle of Judah, so as not to leave to you a remnant:
\v 8 by provoking Me to anger by the works of your hands, by making perfume to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are going in to sojourn, so as to cut yourselves off, and so as to your being for a reviling and for a reproach among all nations of the earth?
\v 9 'Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, that they have done in the land of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem?
\v 10 They have not been humbled unto this day, nor have they been afraid, nor have they walked in My law, and in My statutes, that I have set before you and before your fathers.
\v 11 'Therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am setting my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah,
\v 12 and I have taken the remnant of Judah, who have set their faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they have all been consumed in the land of Egypt; they fall by sword, by famine they are consumed, from the least even unto the greatest, by sword and by famine they die, and they have been for an execration, for an astonishment, and for a reviling, and for a reproach.
\v 13 'And I have seen after those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I saw after Jerusalem, with sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
\v 14 and there is not an escaped and remaining one of the remnant of Judah, who are entering into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, even to turn back to the land of Judah, where they are lifting up their soul to return to dwell, for they do not turn back, except those escaping.'
\v 15 And they answer Jeremiah — all the men who are knowing that their wives are making perfume to other gods, and all the women who are remaining, a great assembly, even all the people who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, in Pathros — saying:
\v 16 The word that you hast spoken unto us in the name of Yahweh — we are not hearkening unto you;
\v 17 for we certainly do everything that had gone out of our mouth, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our heads, in cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, and — we are satisfied with bread, and we are well, and evil we have not seen.
\v 18 'And from the time we have ceased to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, we have lacked all, and by sword and by famine we have been consumed,
\v 19 and when we are making perfume to the queen of the heavens, and pouring out to her libations — without our husbands have we made for her cakes to idolize her, and to pour out to her libations?'
\v 20 And Jeremiah said unto all the people, concerning the men and concerning the women, and concerning all the people who are answering him, saying:
\v 21 'The perfume that you made in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your fathers, your kings, and your heads, and the people of the land, had not Yahweh remembered it? yea, it came up on His heart.
\v 22 And Yahweh is not able any more to accept you, because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations that you have done, and your land is for a waste, and for an astonishment, and for a reviling, without inhabitant, as at this day.
\v 23 Because that you have made perfume, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, and in His law, and in His statutes, and in His testimonies you have not walked, therefore had this evil met you as at this day.'
\v 24 And Jeremiah said unto all the people, and unto all the women, 'Hear you a word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt,
\v 25 Thus spake Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, saying: Ye and your wives both speak with your mouth, and with your hands have fulfilled, saying: We certainly execute our vows that we have vowed, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, you do certainly establish your vows, and certainly execute your vows.
\v 26 Therefore, hear you a word of Yahweh, all Judah who are dwelling in the land of Egypt: Lo, I — I have sworn by My great name, said Yahweh, My name is no more proclaimed by the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, Live did the Lord Yahweh — in all the land of Egypt.
\v 27 Lo, I am watching over them for evil, and not for good, and consumed have been all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, till their consumption.
\v 28 'And the escaped of the sword turn back out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number, and known have all the remnant of Judah who are coming into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, whose word is established, Mine or theirs.
\v 29 And this is to you the sign — an affirmation of Yahweh — that I am seeing after you in this place, so that you know that My words are certainly established against you for evil;
\v 30 Thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am giving Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those seeking his life, as I have given Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and who is seeking his life.'
\c 45
\v 1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet had spoken unto Baruch son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, concerning you, O Baruch:
\v 3 'You hast said, Woe to me, now, for Yahweh had added sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and rest I have not found.
\v 4 Thus will you say unto him: Thus said Yahweh: Lo, that which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself.
\v 5 And you — you seekest for you great things — do not seek, for behold, I am bringing in evil on all flesh — an affirmation of Yahweh — and I have given to you your life for a spoil, in all places where you goest.'
\c 46
\v 1 That which had been the word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations,
\v 2 For Egypt, concerning the force of Pharaoh-Necho king of Egypt, that had been by the river Phrat, in Carchemish, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had smitten, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
\v 3 'Set you in array shield and buckler, And draw nigh to battle.
\v 4 Gird the horses, and go up, you horsemen, And station yourselves with helmets, Polish the javelins, put on the coats of mail.
\v 5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed — They are turned backward, And their mighty ones are beaten down, And to a refuge they have fled, and not turned the face? Fear is round about — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 6 The swift do not flee, nor do the mighty escape, Northward, by the side of the river Phrat, They have stumbled and fallen.
\v 7 Who is this? as a flood he came up, As rivers do his waters shake themselves!
\v 8 Egypt, as a flood came up, And as rivers the waters shake themselves. And he said, I go up; I cover the land, I destroy the city and the inhabitants in it.
\v 9 Go up, you horses; and boast yourselves, you chariots, And go forth, you mighty, Cush and Phut handling the shield, And Lud handling — treading the bow.
\v 10 And that day is to the Lord Yahweh of Hosts A day of vengeance, To be avenged of His adversaries, And the sword had devoured, and been satisfied, And it had been watered from their blood, For a sacrifice is to the Lord Yahweh of Hosts, In the land of the north, by the river Phrat.
\v 11 Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt, In vain you hast multiplied medicines, Healing there is none for you.
\v 12 Nations have heard of your shame, And your cry had filled the land, For the mighty on the mighty did stumble, Together they have fallen — both of them!'
\v 13 The word that Yahweh had spoken unto Jeremiah the prophet concerning the coming in of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, to smite the land of Egypt:
\v 14 'Declare you in Egypt, and sound in Migdol, Yea, sound in Noph, and in Tahpanhes say: Station thyself, yea, prepare for you, For a sword had devoured around you,
\v 15 Wherefore had your bull been swept away? He had not stood, because Yahweh thrust him away.
\v 16 He had multiplied the stumbling, Yea one had fallen upon his neighbour, And they say: Rise, and we turn back to our people, And unto the land of our birth, Because of the oppressing sword.
\v 17 They have cried there: Pharaoh king of Egypt is a desolation, Passed by had the appointed time.
\v 18 I live — an affirmation of the King, Yahweh of Hosts is His name, Surely as Tabor is among mountains, And as Carmel by the sea — he came in,
\v 19 Goods for removal make for you, O inhabitant, daughter of Egypt, For Noph became a desolation, And had been burnt up, without inhabitant.
\v 20 A heifer very fair is Egypt, Rending from the north did come into her.
\v 21 Even her hired ones in her middle are as calves of the stall, For even they have turned, They have fled together, they have not stood, For the day of their calamity had come on them, The time of their inspection.
\v 22 Its voice as a serpent went on, For with a force they go, And with axes they have come in to her, As hewers of trees.
\v 23 They have cut down her forest, An affirmation of Yahweh — for it is not searched, For they have been more than the grasshopper, And they have no numbering.
\v 24 Ashamed had been the daughter of Egypt, She had been given into the hand of the people of the north.
\v 25 Said had Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am seeing after Amon of No, And after Pharaoh, and after Egypt, And after her gods, and after her kings, And after Pharaoh, and after those trusting in him,
\v 26 And I have given them into the hand of those seeking their life, And into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, And into the hand of his servants, And afterwards it is inhabited, As in days of old — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 27 And you, you will not fear, my servant Jacob, Nor are you dismayed, O Israel, For behold, I am saving you from afar, And your seed from the land of their captivity, And Jacob had turned back, And had been at rest, and been at ease, And there is none disturbing.
\v 28 You, you will not fear, My servant Jacob, An affirmation of Yahweh — for with you I am, For I make an end of all the nations Whither I have driven you, And of you I do not make an end, And I have reproved you in judgment, And do not entirely acquit you!'
\c 47
\v 1 That which had been the word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh smiteth Gaza:
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh: Lo, waters are coming up from the north, And have been for an overflowing stream, And they overflow the land and its fulness, The city, and the inhabitants in it, And men have cried out, And howled had every inhabitant of the land.
\v 3 From the sound of the stamping of the hoofs of his mighty ones, From the rushing of his chariot, the noise of his wheels, Fathers have not turned unto sons, From feebleness of hands,
\v 4 Because of the day that had come to spoil all the Philistines, To cut off to Tyre and to Zidon every helping remnant. For Yahweh is spoiling the Philistines, The remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
\v 5 Come had baldness unto Gaza, Cut off had been Ashkelon, O remnant of their valley, Till when will you cut thyself?
\v 6 Ho, sword of Yahweh, till when are you not quiet? Be removed unto your sheath, rest and cease.
\v 7 How shall it be quiet, And Yahweh had given a charge to it, Against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? There had He appointed it!'
\c 48
\v 1 Concerning Moab: 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo, for it is spoiled, Put to shame, captured had been Kiriathaim, Put to shame had been the high tower, Yea, it had been broken down.
\v 2 There is no more praise of Moab, In Heshbon they devised against it evil: Come, and we cut it off from being a nation, Also, O Madmen, you are cut off, After you went a sword.
\v 3 A voice of a cry is from Horonaim, Spoiling and great destruction.
\v 4 Destroyed had been Moab, Caused a cry to be heard have her little ones.
\v 5 For the ascent of Luhith with weeping, Go up did weeping, For in the descent of Horonaim Adversaries a cry of desolation have heard.
\v 6 Flee you, deliver yourselves, Ye are as a naked thing in a wilderness.
\v 7 For, because of your trusting in your works, And in your treasures, even you are captured, And gone out had Chemosh in a removal, His priests and his heads together.
\v 8 And come in did a spoiler unto every city, And no city did escape, And perished had the valley, And destroyed been the plain, as Yahweh said.
\v 9 Give wings to Moab, for she utterly went out, And her cities are for a desolation, Without an inhabitant in them.
\v 10 Cursed is he who is doing the work of Yahweh slothfully, And cursed is he Who is withholding his sword from blood.
\v 11 Secure is Moab from his youth, And at rest is he for his preserved things, And he had not been emptied out from vessel unto vessel, And into captivity he had not gone, Therefore had his taste remained in him, And his fragrance had not been changed.
\v 12 Therefore, behold, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And I have sent to him wanderers, And they have caused him to wander, And his vessels they empty out, And his bottles they dash in pieces.
\v 13 And ashamed had been Moab because of Chemosh, As the house of Israel have been ashamed Because of Beth-El their confidence.
\v 14 How do you say, We are mighty, And men of strength for battle?
\v 15 Spoiled is Moab, and her cities had one gone up, And the choice of its young men Have gone down to slaughter, An affirmation of the King, Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
\v 16 Near is the calamity of Moab to come, And his affliction had hasted exceedingly.
\v 17 Bemoan for him, all you round about him, And all knowing his name, say you: How had it been broken, the staff of strength, The rod of beauty.
\v 18 Come down from honour, sit in thirst, O inhabitant, daughter of Dibon, For a spoiler of Moab had come up to you, He had destroyed your fenced places.
\v 19 On the way stand, and watch, O inhabitant of Aroer, Ask the fugitive and escaped, Say, What had happened?
\v 20 Put to shame had been Moab, For it had been broken down, Howl and cry, declare you in Arnon, For spoiled is Moab,
\v 21 And judgment had come in unto the land of the plain — unto Holon, And unto Jahazah, and on Mephaath,
\v 22 And on Dibon, and on Nebo, And on Beth-Diblathaim, and on Kirathaim,
\v 23 And on Beth-Gamul, and on Beth-Meon,
\v 24 And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, And on all cities of the land of Moab, The far off and the near.
\v 25 Cut down had been the horn of Moab, And his arm had been broken, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 26 Declare you him drunk, For against Yahweh he made himself great And Moab had stricken in his vomit, And he had been for a derision — even he.
\v 27 And was not Israel the derision to you? Among thieves was he found? For since your words concerning him, You will bemoan thyself.
\v 28 Forsake cities, and dwell in a rock, Ye inhabitants of Moab, And be as a dove making a nest in the passages of a pit's mouth.
\v 29 We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, Exceeding proud! His haughtiness, and his arrogance, And his pride, and the height of his heart,
\v 30 I — I have known, an affirmation of Yahweh, His wrath, and it is not right, His devices — not right they have done.
\v 31 Therefore for Moab I howl, even for Moab — all of it, I cry for men of Kir-Heres, it did mourn,
\v 32 With the weeping of Jazer, I weep for you, O vine of Sibmah, Your branches have passed over a sea, Unto the sea of Jazer they have come, On your summer fruits, and on your harvest, A spoiler had fallen.
\v 33 And removed had been joy and gladness From the fruitful field, Even from the land of Moab, And wine from wine-presses I have caused to cease, Shouting did not proceed, The shouting is no shouting!
\v 34 Because of the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh, Unto Jahaz they have given their voice, From Zoar unto Horonaim, A heifer of the third year, For even waters of Nimrim become desolations.
\v 35 And I have caused to cease to Moab, An affirmation of Yahweh, Him who is offering in a high place, And him who is making perfume to his god.
\v 36 Therefore my heart for Moab as pipes did sound, And my heart for men of Kir-Heres As pipes did sound, Therefore the abundance he made did perish.
\v 37 For every head is bald, and every beard diminished, On all hands cuttings, and on the loins — sackcloth.
\v 38 On all roofs of Moab, and in her broad-places, All of it — is lamentation, For I have broken Moab as a vessel in which there is no pleasure, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 39 How had it been broken down! they have howled, How had Moab turned the neck ashamed, And Moab had been for a derision. And for a terror to all round about her.
\v 40 For thus said Yahweh: Lo, as an eagle he did flee, And had spread his wings unto Moab.
\v 41 Captured have been the cities, And the strongholds are caught, And the heart of the mighty of Moab Hath been in that day as the heart of a distressed woman.
\v 42 And Moab had been destroyed from being a people, For against Yahweh he exerted himself.
\v 43 Fear, and a snare, and a gin, are for you, O inhabitant of Moab — an affirmation of Yahweh,
\v 44 Whoso is fleeing because of the fear falleth into the snare, And whoso is coming up from the snare is captured by the gin, For I bring in unto her — unto Moab — The year of their inspection, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 45 In the shadow of Heshbon stood powerless have fugitives, For fire had gone forth from Heshbon, And a flame from within Sihon, And it consumeth the corner of Moab, And the crown of the sons of Shaon.
\v 46 Woe to you, O Moab, Perished had the people of Chemosh, For your sons were taken with the captives, And your daughters with the captivity.
\v 47 And I have turned back to the captivity of Moab, In the latter end of the days, An affirmation of Yahweh! Hitherto is the judgment of Moab.
\c 49
\v 1 Concerning the sons of Ammon: 'Thus said Yahweh: Sons — had Israel none? heir — had he none? Wherefore had Malcam possessed Gad? And his people in its cities have dwelt?
\v 2 Therefore, behold, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And I have sounded unto Rabbah of the sons of Ammon a shout of battle, And it had been for a heap — a desolation, And her daughters with fire are burnt, And Israel had succeeded its heirs, Said had Yahweh.
\v 3 Howl, Heshbon, for spoiled is Ai, Cry, daughters of Rabbah, gird on sackcloth, Lament, and go to and fro by the hedges, For Malcam into captivity did go, His priests and his princes together.
\v 4 What — will you boast thyself in valleys? Flowed had your valley, O backsliding daughter, Who is trusting in her treasures: Who did come in unto me?
\v 5 Lo, I am bringing in upon you a fear, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh of Hosts, From all round about you, And you have been driven out each before it, And there is no gatherer of the wandering.
\v 6 And after this I turn back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, An affirmation of Yahweh.'
\v 7 Concerning Edom: 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Perished had counsel from the intelligent? Vanished had their wisdom?
\v 8 Flee, turn, go deep to dwell, you inhabitants of Dedan, For the calamity of Esau I brought in upon him, The time I inspected him.
\v 9 If gatherers have come in to you, They do not leave gleanings, If thieves in the night, They have destroyed their sufficiency!
\v 10 For I — I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, And to be hidden he is not able, Spoiled is his seed, and his brethren, And his neighbours, and he is not.
\v 11 Leave yours orphans — I do keep alive, And your widows — on Me trust you,
\v 12 For thus said Yahweh: They whose judgment is not to drink of the cup, Do certainly drink, And you are he that is entirely acquitted! You are not acquitted, for you certainly drinkest.
\v 13 For, by Myself, I have sworn, An affirmation of Yahweh, That for a desolation, for a reproach, For a waste, and for a reviling — is Bozrah, And all her cities are for wastes age-during.
\v 14 A report I have heard from Yahweh, And an ambassador among nations is sent, Gather yourselves and come in against her, And rise you for battle.
\v 15 For, behold, little I have made you among nations, Despised among men.
\v 16 Your terribleness had lifted you up, The pride of your heart, O dweller in clefts of the rock, Holding the high place of the height, For you makest high as an eagle your nest, From there I bring you down, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 17 And Edom had been for a desolation, Every passer by her is astonished, And did hiss because of all her plagues.
\v 18 As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, And its neighbours, said Yahweh, No one did dwell there, Nor sojourn in her did a son of man.
\v 19 Lo, as a lion he came up, Because of the rising of the Jordan, Unto the enduring habitation, But I cause to rest, I cause him to run from off her, And who is chosen? concerning her I lay a charge, For who is like Me? and who conveneth Me? And who is this shepherd who standeth before Me?
\v 20 Therefore, hear you the counsel of Yahweh, That He had counselled concerning Edom, And His devices that He had devised Concerning the inhabitants of Teman: Drag them out do not little ones of the flock, Make desolate over them did he not their habitation?
\v 21 From the noise of their fall had the earth shaken, The cry — at the sea of Suph is its voice heard.
\v 22 Lo, as an eagle he came up, and flieth, And he spreadeth his wings over Bozrah, And the heart of the mighty of Edom had been in that day, As the heart of a distressed woman!'
\v 23 Concerning Damascus: Ashamed had been Hamath and Arpad, For an evil report they have heard, They have been melted, in the sea is sorrow, To be quiet it is not able.
\v 24 Feeble had been Damascus, She turned to flee, and fear strengthened her, Distress and pangs have seized her, as a travailing woman.
\v 25 How is it not left — the city of praise, The city of my joy!
\v 26 Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places, And all the men of war are cut off in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts.
\v 27 And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Damascus, And it consumed palaces of Ben-Hadad!'
\v 28 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had smitten: 'Thus said Yahweh: Arise you, go you up unto Kedar, And spoil the sons of the east.
\v 29 Their tents and their flock they do take, Their curtains, and all their vessels, And their camels, they bear away for themselves, And they called concerning them, Fear is round about.
\v 30 Flee, bemoan mightily, go deep to dwell, Ye inhabitants of Hazor — an affirmation of Yahweh, For given counsel against you had Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Yea, he deviseth against them a device.
\v 31 Rise you, go up unto a nation at rest, Dwelling confidently, an affirmation of Yahweh, It had no two-leaved doors nor bar, Alone they do dwell.
\v 32 And their camels have been for a prey, And the multitude of their cattle for a spoil, And I have scattered them to every wind, Who cut off the corner of the beard, And from all its passages I bring in their calamity, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 33 And Hazor had been for a habitation of dragons, A desolation — unto the age, No one did dwell there, nor sojourn in it did a son of man!'
\v 34 That which had been the word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:
\v 35 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Lo, I am breaking the bow of Elam, The beginning of their might.
\v 36 And I have brought in to Elam four winds, From the four ends of the heavens, And have scattered them to all these winds, And there is no nation where outcasts of Elam come not in.
\v 37 And I have frightened Elam before their enemies, And before those seeking their life, And I have brought in against them evil, The heat of Mine anger, An affirmation of Yahweh, And I have sent after them the sword, Till I have consumed them;
\v 38 And I have set My throne in Elam, And I have destroyed there King and princes — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 39 And it had come to pass, in the latter end of the days, I turn back to the captivity of Elam, An affirmation of Yahweh!'
\c 50
\v 1 The word that Yahweh had spoken concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet:
\v 2 'Declare you among nations, and sound, And lift up an ensign, sound, do not hide, Say you: Captured had been Babylon, Put to shame had been Bel, Broken had been Merodach, Put to shame have been her grievous things, Broken have been her idols.
\v 3 For come up against her had a nation from the north, It made her land become a desolation, And there is not an inhabitant in it. From man even unto beast, They have moved, they have gone.
\v 4 In those days, and at that time, An affirmation of Yahweh, Come in do sons of Israel, They and sons of Judah together, Going on and weeping they go, And Yahweh their God they seek.
\v 5 To Zion they ask the way, Thitherward are their faces: Come in, and we are joined unto Yahweh, A covenant age-during — not forgotten.
\v 6 A perishing flock had My people been, Their shepherds have caused them to err, To the mountains causing them to go back, From mountain unto hill they have gone, They have forgotten their crouching-place.
\v 7 All finding them have devoured them, And their adversaries have said: We are not guilty, Because that they sinned against Yahweh, The habitation of righteousness, And the hope of their fathers — Yahweh.
\v 8 Move you from the middle of Babylon, And from the land of the Chaldeans go out. And be as he-goats before a flock.
\v 9 For, behold, I am stirring up, And am causing to come up against Babylon, An assembly of great nations from a land of the north, And they have set in array against her, From there she is captured, Its arrow — as a skilful hero — returneth not empty,
\v 10 And Chaldea had been for a spoil, All her spoilers are satisfied, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 11 Because you rejoicest, because you exultest, O spoilers of Mine inheritance, Because you increasest as a heifer at the tender grass, And will cry aloud as bulls,
\v 12 Ashamed had been your mother greatly, Confounded had she been that bare you, Lo, the hindermost of nations is a wilderness, A dry land, and a desert.
\v 13 Because of the wrath of Yahweh it is not inhabited, And it had been a desolation — all of it. Every passer by at Babylon is astonished, And did hiss because of all her plagues.
\v 14 Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, All you treading a bow, Shoot at her, have no pity on the arrow, For against Yahweh she had sinned.
\v 15 Shout against her round about, She had given forth her hand, Fallen have her foundations, Thrown down have been her walls, For it is the vengeance of Yahweh, Be avenged of her, as she did — do you to her.
\v 16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, And him handling the sickle in the time of harvest, Because of the oppressing sword, Each unto his people — they turn, And each to his land — they flee.
\v 17 A scattered sheep is Israel, lions have driven away, At first, devour him did the king of Asshur, And now, at last, broken his bone Hath Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
\v 18 Therefore thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am seeing after the king of Babylon, And after his land, As I have seen after the king of Asshur;
\v 19 And I have brought back Israel unto his habitation, And he had fed on Carmel, and on Bashan. And in mount Ephraim, and on Gilead is his soul satisfied.
\v 20 In those days, and at that time, An affirmation of Yahweh, Sought is the iniquity of Israel, and it is not, And the sin of Judah, and it is not found, For I am propitious to those whom I leave!
\v 21 Against the land of Merathaim: Go up against it, and unto the inhabitants of Pekod, Waste and devote their posterity, An affirmation of Yahweh, And do according to all that I have commanded you.
\v 22 A noise of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\v 23 How had it been cut and broken, The hammer of the whole earth! How had Babylon been for a desolation among nations!
\v 24 I have laid a snare for you, And also — you are captured, O Babylon, And you — you hast known, You hast been found, and also are caught, For against Yahweh you hast stirred thyself up.
\v 25 Yahweh had opened His treasury, And He brought out the weapons of His indignation, For a work is to the Lord Yahweh of Hosts, In the land of the Chaldeans.
\v 26 Come you in to her from the extremity, Open you her storehouses, Raise her up as heaps, and devote her, Let her have no remnant.
\v 27 Slay all her kine, they go down to slaughter, Woe is on them, for come had their day, The time of their inspection.
\v 28 A voice of fugitives and escaped ones Is from the land of Babylon, To declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, The vengeance of His temple.
\v 29 Summon unto Babylon archers, all treading the bow, Encamp against her round about, Let her have no escape; Recompense to her according to her work, According to all that she did — do to her, For unto Yahweh she had been proud, Unto the Holy One of Israel.
\v 30 Therefore fall do her young men in her broad places, And all her men of war are cut off in that day, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 31 Lo, I am against you, O pride, An affirmation of the Lord Yahweh of Hosts, For your day had come, the time of your inspection.
\v 32 And stumbled had pride, And he had fallen, and had no raiser up, And I have kindled a fire in his cities, And it had devoured all round about him.
\v 33 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: Oppressed are the sons of Israel, And the sons of Judah together, And all their captors have kept hold on them, They have refused to send them away.
\v 34 Their Redeemer is strong, Yahweh of Hosts is His name, He did thoroughly plead their cause, So as to cause the land to rest, And He had given trouble to the inhabitants of Babylon.
\v 35 A sword is for the Chaldeans, An affirmation of Yahweh, And it is on the inhabitants of Babylon, And on her heads, and on her wise men;
\v 36 A sword is on the princes, And they have become foolish; A sword is on her mighty ones, And they have been broken down;
\v 37 A sword is on his horses and on his chariot, And on all the rabble who are in her middle, And they have become women; A sword is on her treasuries, And they have been spoiled;
\v 38 A sword is on her waters, and they have been dried up, For it is a land of graven images, And in idols they do boast themselves.
\v 39 Therefore dwell do Ziim with Iim, Yea, dwelt in her have daughters of the ostrich, And it is not inhabited any more for ever, Nor dwelt in unto all generations.
\v 40 As overthrown by God with Sodom, And with Gomorrah, and with its neighbours, An affirmation of Yahweh, none did dwell there, Nor sojourn in her did a son of man.
\v 41 Lo, a people had come from the north, Even a great nation, And many kings are stirred up from the sides of the earth.
\v 42 Bow and halbert they seize, Cruel are they, and they have no mercy, Their voice as a sea soundeth, and on horses they ride, Set in array as a man for battle, Against you, O daughter of Babylon.
\v 43 Heard had the king of Babylon their report, And feeble have been his hands, Distress had seized him; pain as a travailing woman.
\v 44 Lo, as a lion he came up, Because of the rising of the Jordan, Unto the enduring habitation, But I cause to rest, I cause them to run from off her. And who is chosen? on her I lay a charge, For who is like Me? And who did convene Me? And who is this shepherd who standeth before Me?
\v 45 Therefore, hear you the counsel of Yahweh, That He counselled concerning Babylon, And His devices that He had devised Concerning the land of the Chaldeans; Drag them out do not little ones of the flock, Doth He not make desolate over them the habitation?
\v 46 From the voice: Captured was Babylon, Hath the earth been shaken, And a cry among nations had been heard!
\c 51
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am stirring up against Babylon, And the inhabitants of Leb — My withstanders, A destroying wind,
\v 2 And I have sent to Babylon fanners, And they have fanned it, and they empty its land, For they have been against it, Round about — in the day of evil.
\v 3 Let not the treader tread his bow, Nor lift himself up in his coat of mail, Nor have you pity on her young men, Devote you to destruction all her host.
\v 4 And fallen have the wounded in the land of the Chaldeans, And the pierced-through in her streets.
\v 5 For, not forsaken is Israel and Judah, By its God — by Yahweh of Hosts, For their land had been full of guilt, Against the Holy One of Israel.
\v 6 Flee you from the middle of Babylon, And deliver you each his soul, Be not cut off in its iniquity, For a time of vengeance it is to Yahweh, Recompence He is rendering to her.
\v 7 A golden cup is Babylon in the hand of Yahweh, Making drunk all the earth, Of its wine drunk have nations, Therefore boast themselves do nations.
\v 8 Suddenly had Babylon fallen, Yea, it is broken, howl you for it, Take balm for her pain, if so be it may be healed.
\v 9 We healed Babylon, and she was not healed, Forsake her, and we go, each to his land, For come unto the heavens had its judgment, And it had been lifted up unto the clouds.
\v 10 Yahweh had brought forth our righteousnesses, Come, and we recount in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.
\v 11 Cleanse you the arrows, fill the shields, Stirred up had Yahweh the spirit of the kings of Madia, For against Babylon His device is to destroy it, For the vengeance of Yahweh it is, The vengeance of His temple.
\v 12 Unto the walls of Babylon lift up an ensign, Strengthen the watch, Establish the watchers, prepare the ambush, For Yahweh had both devised and done that which He spake, Concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
\v 13 O dweller on many waters, abundant in treasures, Come in had yours end, the measure of your dishonest gain.
\v 14 Sworn had Yahweh of Hosts by Himself, That, Surely I have filled you with men as the cankerworm, And they have cried against you — shouting.
\v 15 The maker of earth by His power, The establisher of the world by His wisdom, Who by His understanding stretched out the heavens,
\v 16 At the voice He gave forth, A multitude of waters are in the heavens, And He caused vapours to come up from the end of the earth, Lightnings for rain He had made, And He brought out wind from His treasures.
\v 17 Brutish had been every man by knowledge, Put to shame had been every refiner by a graven image, For false is his molten image, And there is no breath in them.
\v 18 Vanity are they — work of errors, In the time of their inspection they perish.
\v 19 Not like these is the portion of Jacob, For He is former of all things, And Israel is the rod of His inheritance, Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
\v 20 An axe are you to me — weapons of war, And I have broken in pieces by you nations, And I have destroyed by you kingdoms,
\v 21 And I have broken in pieces by you horse and its rider, And I have broken in pieces by you chariot and its charioteer,
\v 22 And I have broken in pieces by you man and woman, And I have broken in pieces by you old and young, And I have broken in pieces by you young man and virgin,
\v 23 And I have broken in pieces by you shepherd and his drove, And I have broken in pieces by you husbandman and his team, And I have broken in pieces by you governors and prefects.
\v 24 And I have recompensed to Babylon, And to all inhabitants of Chaldea, All the evil that they have done in Zion, Before your eyes — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 25 Lo, I am against you, O destroying mount, An affirmation of Yahweh, That is destroying all the earth, And I have stretched out My hand against you, And I have rolled you from the rocks, And given you for a burnt mountain.
\v 26 And they take not out of you a stone for a corner, And a stone for foundations, For desolations age-during are you, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 27 Lift you up an ensign in the land, Blow a trumpet among nations, Sanctify against it nations, Summon against it the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz, Appoint against it an infant head, Cause the horse to ascend as the rough cankerworm.
\v 28 Sanctify against it the nations with the kings of Media, Its governors and all its prefects, And all the land of its dominion.
\v 29 And shake did the land, and it is pained, For stood against Babylon have the purposes of Yahweh, To make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.
\v 30 Ceased have the mighty of Babylon to fight, They have remained in strongholds, Failed had their might, they have become woman, They have burnt her tabernacles, Broken have been her bars.
\v 31 Runner to meet runner did run, And announcer to meet announcer, To announce to the king of Babylon, For, captured had been his city — at the extremity.
\v 32 And the passages have been captured, And the reeds they have burnt with fire, And the men of war have been troubled.
\v 33 For thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, The daughter of Babylon is as a threshing-floor, The time of her threshing — yet a little, And come had the time of her harvest.
\v 34 Devoured us, crushed us, had Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, He had set us as an empty vessel, He had swallowed us as a dragon, He had filled his belly with my dainties, He had driven us away.
\v 35 My wrong, and that of my flesh is on Babylon, Say did the inhabitant of Zion, And my blood is on the inhabitants of Chaldea, Say did Jerusalem.
\v 36 Therefore, thus said Yahweh: Lo, I am pleading your cause, And I have avenged your vengeance, And dried up its sea, and made its fountains dry.
\v 37 And Babylon had been for heaps, A habitation of dragons, An astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
\v 38 Together as young lions they roar, They have shaken themselves as lions' whelps.
\v 39 In their heat I make their banquets, And I have caused them to drink, so that they exult, And have slept a sleep age-during, And awake not — an affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 40 I cause them to go down as lambs to slaughter, As rams with he-goats.
\v 41 How had Sheshach been captured, Yea, caught is the praise of the whole earth, How had Babylon been for an astonishment among nations.
\v 42 Come up against Babylon had the sea, With a multitude of its billows it had been covered.
\v 43 Its cities have been for a desolation, A dry land, and a wilderness, A land — none did dwell in them, Nor pass over into them did a son of man.
\v 44 And I have seen after Bel in Babylon, And I have brought forth that which he swallowed — from his mouth, And flow no more unto him do nations, Also the wall of Babylon had fallen.
\v 45 Go forth from its middle, O My people, And deliver you, each his soul, Because of the fierceness of the anger of Yahweh,
\v 46 And lest your heart be tender, And you be afraid of the report that is heard in the land, And come in a year had the report, And after it in a year the report, And violence is in the land, ruler against ruler;
\v 47 Therefore, behold, days are coming, And I have seen after the graven images of Babylon. And all its land is ashamed, And all its pierced ones do fall in its middle.
\v 48 And cried aloud against Babylon Have heavens and earth, and all that is in them, For, from the north come to it do the spoilers, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 49 Even Babylon is to fall, you pierced of Israel, Even they of Babylon have fallen, Ye pierced of all the earth.
\v 50 Ye escaped of the sword, go on, stand not, Remember you from afar Yahweh, And let Jerusalem come up on your heart.
\v 51 We have been ashamed, for we heard reproach, Covered had shame our faces, For come in have strangers, against the sanctuaries of the house of Yahweh.
\v 52 Therefore, behold, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And I have seen after its graven images, And in all its land groan did the wounded.
\v 53 Because Babylon went up to the heavens, And because it fenceth the high place of its strength, From Me come into it do spoilers, An affirmation of Yahweh.
\v 54 A voice of a cry is from Babylon, And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldean.
\v 55 For Yahweh is spoiling Babylon, And had destroyed out of it a great voice, And sounded have its billows as many waters, Given forth a noise had their voice.
\v 56 For come in against it — against Babylon — had a spoiler, And captured have been its mighty ones, Broken have been their bows, For the God of recompences — Yahweh — did certainly repay.
\v 57 And I have caused its princes to drink, And its wise men, its governors, And its prefects, and its mighty ones, And they have slept a sleep age-during, And they awake not — an affirmation of the king, Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
\v 58 Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, the wall of Babylon — The broad one — is utterly made bare, And her high gates with fire are burnt, And peoples labour in vain, And nations in fire, and have been weary!
\v 59 The word that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign — and Seraiah is a quiet prince;
\v 60 and Jeremiah writeth all the evil that came unto Babylon on one book — all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
\v 61 And Jeremiah said unto Seraiah, 'When you will enter Babylon, then you hast seen, and hast read all these words,
\v 62 and hast said: Yahweh, You, You hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that there is none dwelling in it, from man even unto cattle, for it is a desolation age-during.
\v 63 And it had come to pass, when you will finish reading this book, you will bind to it a stone, and hast cast it into the middle of Phrat,
\v 64 and said, Thus sink did Babylon, and it did not arise, because of the evil that I am bringing in against it, and they have been weary.' Hitherto are words of Jeremiah.
\c 52
\v 1 A son of twenty and one years is Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he had reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\v 2 and he did the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done,
\v 3 for, because of the anger of Yahweh, it had been in Jerusalem and Judah till He had cast them from before His face, and Zedekiah did rebel against the king of Babylon.
\v 4 And it came to pass, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, come had Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon — he and all his force — against Jerusalem, and they encamp against it, and build against it a fortification round about;
\v 5 and the city came into siege till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\v 6 In the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, when the famine is severe in the city, and there had been no bread for the people of the land,
\v 7 then is the city broken up, and all the men of war flee, and go forth from the city by night, the way of the gate between the two walls, that is by the king's garden — and the Chaldeans are by the city round about — and they go the way of the plain.
\v 8 And the forces of the Chaldeans pursue after the king, and overtake Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his forces have been scattered from him,
\v 9 and they capture the king, and bring him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he spoke with him — judgments.
\v 10 And the king of Babylon slaughtereth the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also all the princes of Judah had he slaughtered in Riblah;
\v 11 and the eyes of Zedekiah he had blinded, and he bindeth him in brazen fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon, and putteth him in the house of inspection unto the day of his death.
\v 12 And in the fifth month, in the tenth of the month — it is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon — come had Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners; he had stood before the king of Babylon in Jerusalem,
\v 13 and he burneth the house of Yahweh, and the house of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house he had burned with fire,
\v 14 and all the walls of Jerusalem round about broken down have all the forces of the Chaldeans that are with the chief of the executioners.
\v 15 And of the poor of the people, and the remnant of the people who are left in the city, and those who are falling away, who have fallen unto the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the multitude, had Nebuzar-Adan chief of the executioners, removed;
\v 16 and of the poor of the land had Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, left for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
\v 17 And the pillars of brass that are to the house of Yahweh, and the bases, and the brasen sea that is in the house of Yahweh, have the Chaldeans broken, and they bear away all the brass of them to Babylon;
\v 18 and the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they minister, they have taken away;
\v 19 and the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups, the gold of that which is gold, and the silver of that which is silver, had the chief of the executioners taken.
\v 20 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen that are beneath the bases, that king Solomon made for the house of Yahweh, there was no weighing of the brass of all these vessels.
\v 21 As to the pillars, eighteen cubits is the height of the one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits did compass it, and its thickness is four fingers hollow.
\v 22 And the chapiter upon it is of brass, and the height of the one chapiter is five cubits, and net-work and pomegranates are on the chapiter round about, the whole is of brass; and like these have the second pillar, and pomegranates.
\v 23 And the pomegranates are ninety and six on a side, all the pomegranates are a hundred on the net-work round about.
\v 24 And the chief of the executioners took Seraiah the head priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold,
\v 25 and out of the city he had taken a certain eunuch, who had been inspector over the men of war, and seven men of those seeing the king's face, who have been found in the city, and the head scribe of the host, who mustereth the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land, who are found in the middle of the city;
\v 26 and Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, took them, and brought them unto the king of Babylon to Riblah,
\v 27 and the king of Babylon smiteth them, and putteth them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and he removeth Judah from off its own ground.
\v 28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar had removed: in the seventh year, of Jews, three thousand and twenty and three;
\v 29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar — from Jerusalem, souls, eight hundred thirty and two;
\v 30 in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, had Nebuzar-Adan chief of the guard removed of Jewish souls, seven hundred forty and five; all the souls are four thousand and six hundred.
\v 31 And it came to pass, in the thirty and seventh year of the removal of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and fifth of the month, had Evil-Merodach king of Babylon lifted up, in the year of his reign, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out from the house of restraint,
\v 32 and spoke with him good things, and setteth his throne above the throne of the kings who are with him in Babylon,
\v 33 and he had changed his prison garments, and he had eaten bread before him continually, all the days of his life.
\v 34 And his allowance — a continual allowance — had been given to him by the king of Babylon, the matter of a day in its day, till the day of his death — all days of his life.
