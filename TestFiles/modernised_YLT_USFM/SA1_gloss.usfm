\c 1
\v 1 And there is a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name is Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, and Ephrathite,
\v 2 and he had two wives, the name of the one is Hannah, and the name of the second Peninnah, and Peninnah had children, and Hannah had no children.
\v 3 And that man had gone up out of his city from time to time, to bow himself, and to sacrifice, before Yahweh of Hosts, in Shiloh, and there are two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh.
\v 4 And the day came, and Elkanah sacrificeth, and he had given to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions,
\v 5 and to Hannah he gave a certain portion — double, for he had loved Hannah, and Yahweh had shut her womb;
\v 6 and her adversity had also provoked her greatly, so as to make her tremble, for Yahweh had shut up her womb.
\v 7 And so he did year by year, from the time of her going up into the house of Yahweh, so it provoketh her, and she weepeth, and did not eat.
\v 8 And Elkanah her husband said to her, 'Hannah, why weepest you? and why will you not eat? and why is your heart afflicted? am I not better to thee than ten sons?'
\v 9 And Hannah riseth after eating in Shiloh, and after drinking, and Eli the priest is sitting on the throne by the side-post of the temple of Yahweh.
\v 10 And she is bitter in soul, and prayeth unto Yahweh, and weepeth greatly,
\v 11 and voweth a vow, and said, 'Yahweh of Hosts, if Thou will certainly look on the affliction of Your handmaid, and hast remembered me, and will not forget Your handmaid, and hast given to Your handmaid seed of men — then I have given him to Yahweh all days of his life, and a razor did not go up upon his head.'
\v 12 And it had been, when she multiplied praying before Yahweh, that Eli is watching her mouth,
\v 13 and Hannah, she is speaking to her heart, only her lips are moving, and her voice is not heard, and Eli reckoneth her to be drunken.
\v 14 And Eli said unto her, 'Until when are you drunken? turn aside your wine from thee.'
\v 15 And Hannah answereth and said, 'No, my lord, A woman sharply pained in spirit I am, and wine and strong drink I have not drunk, and I pour out my soul before Yahweh;
\v 16 put not your handmaid before a daughter of worthlessness, for from the abundance of my meditation, and of my provocation, I have spoken hitherto.'
\v 17 And Eli answereth and said, 'Go in peace, and the God of Israel did give your petition which you hast asked of Him.'
\v 18 And she said, 'Let your handmaid find grace in yours eyes;' and the woman went on her way, and eateth, and her countenance had not been sad for it any more.
\v 19 And they rise early in the morning, and bow themselves before Yahweh, and turn back, and come in unto their house in Ramah, and Elkanah knoweth Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her;
\v 20 and it came to pass, at the revolution of the days, that Hannah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and called his name Samuel, 'for, from Yahweh I have asked him.'
\v 21 And the man Elkanah went up, and all his house, to sacrifice to Yahweh the sacrifice of the days, and his vow.
\v 22 And Hannah had not gone up, for she said to her husband, 'Till the youth is weaned — then I have brought him in, and he had appeared before the face of Yahweh, and dwelt there — unto the age.'
\v 23 And Elkanah her husband said to her, 'Do that which is good in yours eyes; abide till your weaning him; only, Yahweh establish His word;' and the woman abideth and suckleth her son till she had weaned him,
\v 24 and she caused him to go up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him into the house of Yahweh at Shiloh, and the youth is but a youth.
\v 25 And they slaughter the bullock, and bring in the youth unto Eli,
\v 26 and she said, 'O, my lord, your soul lived! my lord, I am the woman who stood with thee in this place, to pray unto Yahweh;
\v 27 for this youth I prayed, and Yahweh did give to me my petition which I asked of Him;
\v 28 and also I have caused him to be asked for Yahweh, all the days that he had lived — he is asked for Yahweh;' and he boweth himself there before Yahweh.
\c 2
\v 1 And Hannah prayeth, and said: 'My heart had exulted in Yahweh, My horn had been high in Yahweh, My mouth had been large over mine enemies, For I have rejoiced in Your salvation.
\v 2 There is none holy like Yahweh, For there is none save Thee, And there is no rock like our God.
\v 3 Ye multiply not — ye speak haughtily — The old saying went out from your mouth, For a God of knowledge is Yahweh, And by Him actions are weighed.
\v 4 Bows of the mighty are broken, And the stumbling have girded on strength.
\v 5 The satiated for bread hired themselves, And the hungry have ceased. While the barren had borne seven, And she abounding with sons had languished.
\v 6 Yahweh putteth to death, and keepeth alive, He brought down to Sheol, and brought up.
\v 7 Yahweh dispossesseth, and He made rich, He made low, yea, He made high.
\v 8 He raiseth from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He lifteth up the needy, To cause them to sit with nobles, Yea, a throne of honour He did cause them to inherit, For to Yahweh are the fixtures of earth, And He setteth on them the habitable world.
\v 9 The feet of His saints He keepeth, And the wicked in darkness are silent, For not by power did man become mighty.
\v 10 Yahweh — broken down are His adversaries, Against them in the heavens He thundereth: Yahweh judgeth the ends of earth, And gave strength to His king, And exalteth the horn of His anointed.'
\v 11 And Elkanah went to Ramath, unto his house, and the youth had been serving Yahweh, in the presence of Eli the priest;
\v 12 and the sons of Eli are sons of worthlessness, they have not known Yahweh.
\v 13 And the custom of the priests with the people is: any man sacrificing a sacrifice — then had the servant of the priest come in when the flesh is boiling, and the hook of three teeth in his hand,
\v 14 and had struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the hook brought up did the priest take for himself; thus they do to all Israel who are coming in, there, in Shiloh.
\v 15 Also before they make perfume with the fat — then had the priest's servant come in, and said to the man who is sacrificing, 'Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he did not take of thee flesh boiled, but raw;'
\v 16 and the man said unto him, 'Let them surely make a perfume (as to-day) with the fat, then take to thee as your soul desireth;' and he had said to him, 'Surely now you will give; and if not — I have taken by strength.'
\v 17 And the sin of the young men is very great in the presence of Yahweh, for the men have despised the offering of Yahweh.
\v 18 And Samuel is ministering in the presence of Yahweh, a youth girt with an ephod of linen;
\v 19 and a small upper coat did his mother make to him, and she had brought it up to him from time to time, in her coming up with her husband to sacrifice the sacrifice of the time.
\v 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah, and his wife, and said, 'Yahweh did appoint for thee seed of this woman, for the petition which she asked for Yahweh;' and they have gone to their place.
\v 21 When Yahweh had looked after Hannah, then she conceiveth and beareth three sons and two daughters; and the youth Samuel groweth up with Yahweh.
\v 22 And Eli is very old, and had heard all that his sons do to all Israel, and how that they lie with the women who are assembling at the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 23 and he said to them, 'Why do ye things like these? for I am hearing of your evil words from all the people — these!
\v 24 Nay, my sons; for the report which I am hearing is not good causing the people of Yahweh to transgress. — 
\v 25 If a man sin against a man, then had God judged him; but if against Yahweh a man sin, who did pray for him?' and they hearken not to the voice of their father, yough Yahweh had delighted to put them to death.
\v 26 And the youth Samuel is going on and growing up, and is good both with Yahweh, and also with men.
\v 27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, 'Thus said Yahweh, Was I really revealed unto the house of your father in their being in Egypt, before Pharaoh's house,
\v 28 even to choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to Me for a priest, to go up on Mine altar, to make a perfume, to bear an ephod before Me, and I give to the house of your father all the fire-offerings of the sons of Israel?
\v 29 Why do ye kick at My sacrifice, and at Mine offering which I commanded in My habitation, and will honour your sons above Me, to make yourselves fat from the first part of every offering of Israel, of My people?
\v 30 Therefore — the affirmation of Yahweh, God of Israel — I certainly said, Your house and the house of your father, do walk up and down before Me to the age; and now — the affirmation of Yahweh — Far be it from Me! for he who is honouring Me, I honour, and those despising Me, are lightly esteemed.
\v 31 Lo, days are coming, and I have cut off yours arm, and the arm of the house of your father, that an old man is not in your house;
\v 32 and you hast beheld an adversary in My habitation, in all that He did good with Israel, and there is not an old man in your house all the days.
\v 33 And the man I cut not off of yours from Mine altar, is to consume yours eyes, and to grieve your soul; and all the increase of your house do die men;
\v 34 and this is to thee the sign that came unto your two sons, unto Hophni and Phinehas — in one day they die both of them;
\v 35 and I have raised up for Me a stedfast priest; as in My heart and in My soul he did do; and I have built for him a stedfast house, and he had walked up and down before Mine anointed all the days;
\v 36 and it had been, every one who is left in your house did come in to bow himself to him, for a wage of silver, and a cake of bread, and had said, Admit me, I pray thee, unto one of the priest's offices, to eat a morsel of bread.'
\c 3
\v 1 And the youth Samuel is serving Yahweh before Eli, and the word of Yahweh had been precious in those days — there is no vision broken forth.
\v 2 And it came to pass, at that time, that Eli is lying down in his place, and his eyes have begun to be dim — he is not able to see.
\v 3 And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished, and Samuel is lying down in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God is,
\v 4 and Yahweh called unto Samuel, and he said, 'Here am I.'
\v 5 And he runneth unto Eli, and said, 'Here am I, for you hast called for me;' and he said, 'I called not; turn back, lie down;' and he went and lieth down.
\v 6 And Yahweh addeth to call again Samuel, and Samuel riseth and went unto Eli, and said, 'Here am I, for you hast called for me;' and he said, 'I have not called, my son, turn back, lie down.'
\v 7 And Samuel had not yet known Yahweh, and the word of Yahweh is not yet revealed unto him.
\v 8 And Yahweh addeth to call Samuel the third time, and he riseth and went unto Eli, and said, 'Here am I, for you hast called for me;' and Eli understandeth that Yahweh is calling to the youth.
\v 9 And Eli said to Samuel, 'Go, lie down, and it had been, if He did call unto thee, that you hast said, Speak, Yahweh, for Your servant is hearing;' and Samuel went and lieth down in his place.
\v 10 And Yahweh came, and stationeth Himself, and called as time by time, 'Samuel, Samuel;' and Samuel said, 'Speak, for Your servant is hearing.'
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto Samuel, 'Lo, I am doing a thing in Israel, at which the two ears of every one hearing it do tingle.
\v 12 In that day I establish unto Eli all that I have spoken unto his house, beginning and completing;
\v 13 and I have declared to him that I am judging his house — to the age, for the iniquity which he had known, for his sons are making themselves vile, and he had not restrained them,
\v 14 and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for, by sacrifice, and by offering — unto the age.'
\v 15 And Samuel lieth till the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, and Samuel is afraid of declaring the vision unto Eli.
\v 16 And Eli called Samuel, and said, 'Samuel, my son;' and he said, 'Here am I.'
\v 17 And he said, 'What is the word which He had spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me; so did God do to thee, and so did He add, if you hidest from me a word of all the words that He had spoken unto thee.'
\v 18 And Samuel declareth to him the whole of the words, and had not hid from him; and he said, 'It is Yahweh; that which is good in His eyes He did.'
\v 19 And Samuel groweth up, and Yahweh had been with him, and had not let fall any of his words to the earth;
\v 20 and all Israel know, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, that Samuel is established for a prophet to Yahweh.
\v 21 And Yahweh addeth to appear in Shiloh, for Yahweh had been revealed unto Samuel, in Shiloh, by the word of Yahweh.
\c 4
\v 1 And the word of Samuel is to all Israel, and Israel went out to meet the Philistines for battle, and they encamp by Eben-Ezer, and the Philistines have encamped in Aphek,
\v 2 and the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel, and the battle spreadeth itself, and Israel is smitten before the Philistines, and they smite among the ranks in the field about four yousand men.
\v 3 And the people came in unto the camp, and the elders of Israel say, 'Why had Yahweh smitten us to-day before the Philistines? we take unto us from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and it came into our middle, and He did save us out of the hand of our enemies.'
\v 4 And the people sent to Shiloh, and they take up there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Hosts, inhabiting the cherubs, and there are two sons of Eli, with the ark of the covenant of God, Hophni and Phinehas.
\v 5 And it came to pass, at the coming in of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh unto the camp, that all Israel shout — a great shout — and the earth is moved.
\v 6 And the Philistines hear the noise of the shouting, and say, 'What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?' and they perceive that the ark of Yahweh had come in unto the camp.
\v 7 And the Philistines are afraid, for they said, 'God had come in unto the camp;' and they say, 'Woe to us, for there had not been like this heretofore.
\v 8 Woe to us, who did deliver us out of the hand of these honourable gods? these are the gods who are smiting the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.
\v 9 Strengthen yourselves, and become men, O Philistines, lest ye do service to Hebrews, as they have done to you — then ye have become men, and have fought.'
\v 10 And the Philistines fight, and Israel is smitten, and they flee each to his tents, and the blow is very great, and there fall of Israel thirty yousand footmen;
\v 11 and the ark of God had been taken, and the two sons of Eli have died, Hophni and Phinehas.
\v 12 And a man of Benjamin runneth out of the ranks, and came into Shiloh, on that day, and his long robes are rent, and earth on his head;
\v 13 and he came in, and lo, Eli is sitting on the throne by the side of the way, watching, for his heart had been trembling for the ark of God, and the man had come in to declare it in the city, and all the city crieth out.
\v 14 And Eli heareth the noise of the cry, and said, 'What — the noise of this tumult!' And the man hasted, and came in, and declareth to Eli.
\v 15 And Eli is a son of ninety and eight years, and his eyes have stood, and he had not been able to see.
\v 16 And the man said unto Eli, 'I am he who had come out of the ranks, and I out of the ranks have fled to-day;' and he said, 'What had been the matter, my son?'
\v 17 And he who is bearing tidings answereth and said, 'Israel had fled before the Philistines, and also a great slaughter had been among the people, and also your two sons have died — Hophni and Phinehas — and the ark of God had been captured.'
\v 18 And it came to pass, at his mentioning the ark of God, that he falleth from off the throne backward, by the side of the gate, and his neck is broken, and he dieth, for the man is old and heavy, and he had judged Israel forty years.
\v 19 And his daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, is pregnant, about to bear, and she heareth the report of the taking of the ark of God, that her father-in-law and her husband have died, and she boweth, and beareth, for her pains have turned upon her.
\v 20 And at the time of her death, when the women who are standing by her say, 'Fear not, for a son you hast borne,' she had not answered, nor set her heart to it;
\v 21 and she called the youth I-Chabod, saying, 'Honour had removed from Israel,' because of the taking of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
\v 22 And she said, 'Honour had removed from Israel, for the ark of God had been taken.'
\c 5
\v 1 And the Philistines have taken the ark of God, and bring it in from Eben-Ezer to Ashdod,
\v 2 and the Philistines take the ark of God and bring it into the house of Dagon, and set it near Dagon.
\v 3 And the Ashdodites rise early on the morrow, and lo, Dagon is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of Yahweh; and they take Dagon, and put it back to its place.
\v 4 And they rise early in the morning on the morrow, and lo, Dagon is fallen on its face to the earth, before the ark of Yahweh, and the head of Dagon, and the two palms of its hands are cut off at the threshold, only the fishy part had been left to him;
\v 5 therefore the priests of Dagon, and all those coming into the house of Dagon, tread not on the threshold of Dagon, in Ashdod, till this day.
\v 6 And the hand of Yahweh is heavy on the Ashdodites, and He made them desolate, and smiteth them with emerods, Ashdod and its borders.
\v 7 And the men of Ashdod see that it is so, and have said, 'The ark of the God of Israel did not abide with us, for hard had been His hand upon us, and upon Dagon our god.'
\v 8 And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines unto them, and say, 'What do we do to the ark of the God of Israel?' and they say, 'To Gath let the ark of the God of Israel be brought round;' and they bring round the ark of the God of Israel;
\v 9 and it came to pass after they have brought it round, that the hand of Yahweh is against the city — a very great destruction; and He smiteth the men of the city, from small even unto great; and break forth on them do emerods.
\v 10 And they send the ark of God to Ekron, and it came to pass, at the coming in of the ark of God to Ekron, that the Ekronites cry out, saying, 'They have brought round unto us the ark of the God of Israel, to put us to death — and our people.'
\v 11 And they send and gather all the princes of the Philistines, and say, 'Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and it turneth back to its place, and it did not put us to death — and our people;' for there had been a deadly destruction throughout all the city, very heavy had the hand of God been there,
\v 12 and the men who have not died have been smitten with emerods, and the cry of the city went up into the heavens.
\c 6
\v 1 And the ark of Yahweh is in the field of the Philistines seven months,
\v 2 and the Philistines call for priests and for diviners, saying, 'What do we do to the ark of Yahweh? let us know wherewith we send it to its place?'
\v 3 And they say, 'If ye are sending away the ark of the God of Israel, ye do not send it away empty; for ye do certainly send back to Him a guilt-offering; then ye are healed, and it had been known to you why His hand did not turn aside from you.'
\v 4 And they say, 'What is the guilt-offering which we send back to Him?' and they say, 'The number of the princes of the Philistines — five golden emerods, and five golden mice — for one plague is to you all, and to your princes,
\v 5 and ye have made images of your emerods, and images of your mice that are corrupting the land, and have given honour to the God of Israel; it may be He did lighten His hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land;
\v 6 and why do ye harden your heart as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? do they not — when He had rolled Himself upon them — send them away, and they go?
\v 7 'And now, take and make one new cart, and two suckling kine, on which a yoke had not gone up, and ye have bound the kine in the cart, and caused their young ones to turn back from after them to the house,
\v 8 and ye have taken the ark of Yahweh, and put it on the cart, and the vessels of gold which ye have returned to Him — a guilt-offering — ye put in a coffer on its side, and have sent it away, and it had gone;
\v 9 and ye have seen, if the way of its own border it went up to Beth-Shemesh — He had done to us this great evil; and if not, then we have known that His hand had not come against us; an accident it had been to us.'
\v 10 And the men do so, and take two suckling kine, and bind them in the cart, and their young ones they have shut up in the house;
\v 11 and they place the ark of Yahweh upon the cart, and the coffer, and the golden mice, and the images of their emerods.
\v 12 And the kine go straight in the way, on the way to Beth-Shemesh, in one highway they have gone, going and lowing, and have not turned aside right or left; and the princes of the Philistines are going after them unto the border of Beth-Shemesh.
\v 13 And the Beth-Shemeshites are reaping their wheat-harvest in the valley, and they lift up their eyes, and see the ark, and rejoice to see it.
\v 14 And the cart had come in unto the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite, and standeth there, and there is a great stone, and they cleave the wood of the cart, and the kine they have caused to ascend — a burnt-offering to Yahweh.
\v 15 And the Levites have taken down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer which is with it, in which are the vessels of gold, and place them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-Shemesh have caused to ascend burnt-offerings and sacrifice sacrifices in that day to Yahweh;
\v 16 and the five princes of the Philistines have seen it, and turn back to Ekron, on that day.
\v 17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines have sent back — a guilt-offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
\v 18 and the golden mice — the number of all the cities of the Philistines — for the five princes, from the fenced city even unto the hamlet of the villages, even unto the great meadow on which they placed the ark of Yahweh — are unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite.
\v 19 And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh, for they looked into the ark of Yahweh, yea, He smiteth among the people seventy men — fifty chief men; and the people mourn, because Yahweh smote among the people — a great smiting.
\v 20 And the men of Beth-Shemesh say, 'Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? and unto whom did He go up from us?'
\v 21 And they send messengers unto the inhabitants of Kirjath-Jearim, saying, 'The Philistines have sent back the ark of Yahweh; come down, take it up unto you.'
\c 7
\v 1 And the men of Kirjath-Jearim come and bring up the ark of Yahweh, and bring it in unto the house of Abinadab, in the height, and Eleazar his son they have sanctified to keep the ark of Yahweh.
\v 2 And it came to pass, from the day of the dwelling of the ark in Kirjath-Jearim, that the days are multiplied — yea, they are twenty years — and wail do all the house of Israel after Yahweh.
\v 3 And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, 'If with all your heart ye are turning back unto Yahweh — turn aside the gods of the stranger from your middle, and Ashtaroth; and prepare your heart unto Yahweh, and serve Him only, and He did deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.'
\v 4 And the sons of Israel turn aside the Baalim and Ashtaroth, and serve Yahweh alone;
\v 5 and Samuel said, 'Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I pray for you unto Yahweh.'
\v 6 And they are gathered to Mizpeh, and draw water, and pour out before Yahweh, and fast on that day, and say there, 'We have sinned against Yahweh;' and Samuel judgeth the sons of Israel in Mizpeh.
\v 7 And the Philistines hear that the sons of Israel have gathered themselves to Mizpeh; and the princes of the Philistines go up against Israel, and the sons of Israel hear, and are afraid of the presence of the Philistines.
\v 8 And the sons of Israel say unto Samuel, 'Keep not silent for us from crying unto Yahweh our God, and He did save us out of the hand of the Philistines.'
\v 9 And Samuel taketh a fat lamb, and caused it to go up — a burnt-offering whole to Yahweh; and Samuel crieth unto Yahweh for Israel, and Yahweh answereth him;
\v 10 and Samuel is causing the burnt-offering to go up — and the Philistines have drawn nigh to battle against Israel — and Yahweh did thunder with a great noise, on that day, upon the Philistines, and troubleth them, and they are smitten before Israel.
\v 11 And the men of Israel go out from Mizpeh, and pursue the Philistines, and smite them unto the place of Beth-Car.
\v 12 And Samuel taketh a stone, and setteth it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called its name Eben-Ezer, saying, 'Hitherto had Yahweh helped us.'
\v 13 And the Philistines are humbled, and have not added any more to come into the border of Israel, and the hand of Yahweh is on the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\v 14 And the cities which the Philistines have taken from Israel are restored to Israel — from Ekron even unto Gath — and their border had Israel delivered out of the hand of the Philistines; and there is peace between Israel and the Amorite.
\v 15 And Samuel judgeth Israel all the days of his life,
\v 16 and he had gone from year to year, and gone round Beth-El, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all these places;
\v 17 and his returning is to Ramath, for there is his house, and there he had judged Israel, and he built there an altar to Yahweh.
\c 8
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Samuel is aged, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
\v 2 And the name of his first-born son is Joel, and the name of his second Abiah, judges in Beer-Sheba:
\v 3 and his sons have not walked in his ways, and turn aside after the dishonest gain, and take a bribe, and turn aside judgment.
\v 4 And all the elders of Israel gather themselves together, and come in unto Samuel to Ramath,
\v 5 and say unto him, 'Lo, you hast become aged, and your sons have not walked in your ways; now, appoint to us a king, to judge us, like all the nations.'
\v 6 And the thing is evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they have said, 'Give to us a king to judge us;' and Samuel prayeth unto Yahweh.
\v 7 And Yahweh said unto Samuel, 'Hearken to the voice of the people, to all that they say unto thee, for thee they have not rejected, but Me they have rejected, from reigning over them.
\v 8 According to all the works that they have done from the day of My bringing them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, when they forsake Me, and serve other gods — so they are doing also to thee.
\v 9 And now, hearken to their voice; only, surely you will certainly protest to them, and hast declared to them the custom of the king who did reign over them.'
\v 10 And Samuel spoke all the words of Yahweh unto the people who are asking from him a king,
\v 11 and said, 'This is the custom of the king who did reign over you: Your sons he did take, and had appointed for himself among his chariots, and among his horsemen, and they have run before his chariots;
\v 12 also to appoint for himself heads of yousands, and heads of fifties; also to plow his plowing, and to reap his reaping; and to make instruments of his war, and instruments of his charioteer.
\v 13 'And your daughters he did take for perfumers, and for cooks, and for bakers;
\v 14 and your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards — the best — he did take, and had given to his servants.
\v 15 And your seed and your vineyards he did tithe, and had given to his eunuchs, and to his servants.
\v 16 And your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your young men — the best, and your asses, he did take, and had prepared for his own work;
\v 17 your flock he did tithe, and ye are to him for servants.
\v 18 And ye have cried out in that day because of the king whom ye have chosen for yourselves, and Yahweh did not answer you in that day.'
\v 19 And the people refuse to hearken to the voice of Samuel, and say, 'Nay, but a king is over us,
\v 20 and we have been, even we, like all the nations; and our king had judged us, and gone out before us, and fought our battles.'
\v 21 And Samuel heareth all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of Yahweh;
\v 22 and Yahweh said unto Samuel, 'Hearken to their voice, and you hast caused to reign over them a king.' And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, 'Go ye each to his city.'
\c 9
\v 1 And there is a man of Benjamin, and his name is Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, mighty of valour,
\v 2 and he had a son, and his name is Saul, a choice youth and goodly, and there is not a man among the sons of Israel goodlier than he — from his shoulder and upward, higher than any of the people.
\v 3 And the asses of Kish, father of Saul, are lost, and Kish said unto Saul his son, 'Take, I pray thee, with thee, one of the young men, and rise, go, seek the asses.'
\v 4 And he passeth over through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passeth over through the land of Shalisha, and they have not found; and they pass over through the land of Shaalim, and they are not; and he passeth over through the land of Benjamin, and they have not found.
\v 5 They have come in unto the land of Zuph, and Saul had said to his young man who is with him, 'Come, and we turn back, lest my father leave off from the asses, and had been sorrowful for us.'
\v 6 And he said to him, 'Lo, I pray thee, a man of God is in this city, and the man is honoured; all that he spoke did certainly come; now, we go there, it may be he did declare to us our way on which we have gone.'
\v 7 And Saul said to his young man, 'And lo, we go, and what do we bring in to the man? for the bread had gone from our vessels, and a present there is not to bring in to the man of God — what is with us?'
\v 8 And the young man addeth to answer Saul, and said, 'Lo, there is found with me a fourth of a shekel of silver: and I have given to the man of God, and he had declared to us our way.'
\v 9 Formerly in Israel, thus said the man in his going to seek God, 'Come and we go unto the seer,' for the 'prophet' of to-day is called formerly 'the seer.'
\v 10 And Saul said to his young man, 'Your word is good; come, we go;' and they go unto the city where the man of God is.
\v 11 They are going up in the ascent of the city, and have found young women going out to draw water, and say to them, 'Is the seer in this place?'
\v 12 And they answer them and say, 'He is; lo, before thee! haste, now, for to-day he had come in to the city, for the people had a stated sacrifice in a high place.
\v 13 At your going in to the city so ye do find him, before he did go up in to the high place to eat; for the people do not eat till his coming, for he did bless the sacrifice; afterwards they eat, who are called, and now, go up, for at this time ye find him.'
\v 14 And they go up in to the city; they are coming in to the middle of the city, and lo, Samuel is coming out to meet them, to go up to the high place;
\v 15 and Yahweh had uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before the coming of Saul, saying,
\v 16 At this time tomorrow, I send unto thee a man out of the land of Benjamin — and you hast anointed him for leader over My people Israel, and he had saved My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have seen My people, for its cry had come in unto Me.'
\v 17 When Samuel had seen Saul, then had Yahweh answered him, 'Lo, the man of whom I have spoken unto thee; this one did restrain My people.'
\v 18 And Saul draweth nigh to Samuel in the middle of the gate, and said, 'Declare, I pray thee, to me, where is this — the seer's house?'
\v 19 And Samuel answereth Saul and said, 'I am the seer; go up before me into the high place, and ye have eaten with me to-day, and I have sent thee away in the morning, and all that is in your heart I declare to thee.
\v 20 As to the asses which are lost to thee this day three days, set not your heart to them, for they have been found; and to whom is all the desire of Israel?' is it not to thee and to all your father's house?'
\v 21 And Saul answereth and said, 'Am not I a Benjamite — of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? and why hast you spoken unto me according to this word?'
\v 22 And Samuel taketh Saul, and his young man, and brought them in to the chamber, and gave to them a place at the head of those called; and they are about thirty men.
\v 23 And Samuel said to the cook, 'Give the portion which I gave to thee, of which I said unto thee, 'Set it by thee?'
\v 24 (and the cook lifteth up the leg, and that which is on it, and setteth before Saul), and he said, 'Lo, that which is left; set it before thee — eat, for to this appointed season it is kept for thee, saying, The people I have called;' and Saul eateth with Samuel on that day.
\v 25 And they come down from the high place to the city, and he spoke with Saul on the roof.
\v 26 And they rise early, and it came to pass, at the ascending of the dawn, that Samuel called unto Saul, on the roof, saying, 'Rise, and I send thee away;' and Saul riseth, and they go out, both of them — he and Samuel, wiyout.
\v 27 They are going down in the extremity of the city, and Samuel had said unto Saul, 'Say to the young man that he pass on before us (and he passeth on), and you, stand at this time, and I cause thee to hear the word of God.'
\c 10
\v 1 And Samuel taketh the vial of the oil, and poureth on his head, and kisseth him, and said, 'Is it not because Yahweh had appointed thee over His inheritance for leader?
\v 2 In your going to-day from me — then you hast found two men by the grave of Rachel, in the border of Benjamin, at Zelzah, and they have said unto thee, The asses have been found which you hast gone to seek; and lo, your father had left the matter of the asses, and had sorrowed for you, saying, What do I do for my son?
\v 3 'And you hast passed on there, and beyond, and hast come in unto the oak of Tabor, and found thee there have three men going up unto God to Beth-El, one bearing three kids, and one bearing three cakes of bread, and one bearing a bottle of wine,
\v 4 and they have asked of thee of welfare, and given to thee two loaves, and you hast received from their hand.
\v 5 Afterwards you will come unto the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is, and it came to pass, at your coming in thither to the city, that you hast met a band of prophets coming down from the high place, and before them psaltery, and tabret, and pipe, and harp, and they are prophesying;
\v 6 and prospered over thee had the Spirit of Yahweh, and you hast prophesied with them, and hast been turned to another man;
\v 7 and it had been, when these signs come to thee — do for yourself as your hand findeth, for God is with thee.
\v 8 'And you hast gone down before me to Gilgal, and lo, I am going down unto thee, to cause to ascend burnt-offerings, to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings; seven days you will wait till my coming in unto thee, and I have made known to thee that which you will do.'
\v 9 And it had been, at his turning his shoulder to go from Samuel, that God turneth to him another heart, and all these signs come on that day,
\v 10 and they come in thither to the height, and lo, a band of prophets — to meet him, and prosper over him did the Spirit of God, and he prophesieth in their middle.
\v 11 And it came to pass, all his acquaintance heretofore, see, and lo, with prophets he had prophesied, and the people say one unto another, 'What is this had happened to the son of Kish? is Saul also among the prophets?'
\v 12 And a man there answereth and said, 'And who is their father?' therefore it had been for a simile, 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'
\v 13 And he ceaseth from prophesying, and came in to the high place,
\v 14 and the uncle of Saul said unto him, and unto his young man, 'Whither went ye?' and he said, 'To seek the asses; and we see that they are not, and we come in unto Samuel.'
\v 15 And the uncle of Saul said, 'Declare, I pray thee, to me, what Samuel said to you?'
\v 16 And Saul said unto his uncle, 'He certainly declared to us that the asses were found;' and of the matter of the kingdom he had not declared to him that which Samuel said.
\v 17 And Samuel called the people unto Yahweh to Mizpeh,
\v 18 and said unto the sons of Israel, 'Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, I have brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms who are oppressing you;
\v 19 and ye to-day have rejected your God, who is Himself your saviour out of all your evils and your distresses, and ye say, 'Nay, but — a king you will set over us; and now, station yourselves before Yahweh, by your tribes, and by your yousands.'
\v 20 And Samuel brought near the whole tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin is captured,
\v 21 and he brought near the tribe of Benjamin by its families, and the family of Matri is captured, and Saul son of Kish is captured, and they seek him, and he had not been found.
\v 22 And they ask again at Yahweh, 'Hath the man yet come hither?' and Yahweh said, 'Lo, he had been hidden near the vessels.'
\v 23 And they run and bring him there, and he stationed himself in the middle of the people, and he is higher than any of the people from his shoulder and upward.
\v 24 And Samuel said unto all the people, 'Have ye seen him on whom Yahweh had fixed, for there is none like him among all the people?' And all the people shout, and say, 'Let the king live!'
\v 25 And Samuel spoke unto the people the right of the kingdom, and writeth in a book, and placeth before Yahweh; and Samuel sent all the people away, each to his house.
\v 26 And also Saul had gone to his house, to Gibeah, and the force go with him whose heart God had touched;
\v 27 and the sons of worthlessness have said, 'What! this one did save us!' and they despise him, and have not brought to him a present; and he is as one deaf.
\c 11
\v 1 And Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encampeth against Jabesh-Gilead, and all the men of Jabesh say unto Nahash, 'Make with us a covenant, and we serve thee.'
\v 2 And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, 'For this I covenant with you, by picking out to you every right eye — and I have put it a reproach on all Israel.'
\v 3 And the elders of Jabesh say to him, 'Let us alone seven days, and we send messengers into all the border of Israel: and if there is none saving us — then we have come out unto thee.'
\v 4 And the messengers come to Gibeah of Saul, and speak the words in the ears of the people, and all the people lift up their voice and weep;
\v 5 and lo, Saul had come after the herd out of the field, and Saul said, 'What — to the people, that they weep?' and they recount to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
\v 6 And the Spirit of God did prosper over Saul, in his hearing these words, and his anger burneth greatly,
\v 7 and he taketh a couple of oxen, and cutteth them in pieces, and sent through all the border of Israel, by the hand of the messengers, saying, 'He who is not coming out after Saul and after Samuel — thus it is done to his oxen;' and the fear of Yahweh falleth on the people, and they come out as one man.
\v 8 And he inspecteth them in Bezek, and the sons of Israel are three hundred yousand, and the men of Judah thirty yousand.
\v 9 And they say to the messengers who are coming, 'Thus do ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: To-morrow ye have safety — by the heat of the sun;' and the messengers come and declare to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoice;
\v 10 and the men of Jabesh say to the Ammonites, 'To-morrow we come out unto you, and ye have done to us according to all that is good in your eyes.'
\v 11 And it came to pass, on the morrow, that Saul putteth the people in three detachments, and they come into the middle of the camp in the morning-watch, and smite Ammon till the heat of the day; and it came to pass that those left are scattered, and there have not been left of them two together.
\v 12 And the people say unto Samuel, 'Who is he that said, Saul did reign over us! give ye up the men, and we put them to death.'
\v 13 And Saul said, 'There is no man put to death on this day, for to-day had Yahweh wrought salvation in Israel.'
\v 14 And Samuel said unto the people, 'Come and we go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there;'
\v 15 and all the people go to Gilgal, and cause Saul to reign there before Yahweh in Gilgal, and sacrifice there sacrifices of peace-offerings before Yahweh, and there Saul rejoiceth — and all the men of Israel — very greatly.
\c 12
\v 1 And Samuel said unto all Israel, 'Lo, I have hearkened to your voice, to all that ye said to me, and I cause to reign over you a king,
\v 2 and now, lo, the king is walking habitually before you, and I have become aged and gray-headed, and my sons, lo, they are with you, and I have walked habitually before you from my youth till this day.
\v 3 Lo, here am I; testify against me, over-against Yahweh, and over-against His anointed; whose ox have I taken, and whose ass have I taken, and whom have I oppressed; whom have I bruised, and of whose hand have I taken a ransom, and hide mine eyes with it? — and I restore to you.'
\v 4 And they say, 'Thou hast not oppressed us, nor hast you crushed us, nor hast you taken from the hand of any one anything.'
\v 5 And he said unto them, 'A witness is Yahweh against you: and a witness is His anointed this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand;' and they say, 'A witness.'
\v 6 And Samuel said unto the people, 'Yahweh — He who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers out of the land of Egypt!
\v 7 and, now, station yourselves, and I judge you before Yahweh, with all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which He did with you, and with your fathers.
\v 8 'When Jacob had come in to Egypt, and your fathers cry unto Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, and they bring out your fathers from Egypt, and cause them to dwell in this place,
\v 9 and they forget Yahweh their God, and He selleth them into the hand of Sisera, head of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fight against them,
\v 10 and they cry unto Yahweh, and say, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and serve the Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and now, deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we serve Thee.
\v 11 'And Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivereth you out of the hand of your enemies round about, and ye dwell confidently.
\v 12 And ye see that Nahash king of the Bene-Ammon had come against you, and ye say to me, Nay, but a king did reign over us; and Yahweh your God is your king!
\v 13 And, now, lo, the king whom ye have chosen — whom ye have asked! and lo, Yahweh had placed over you a king.
\v 14 If ye fear Yahweh, and have served Him, and hearkened to His voice, then ye do not provoke the mouth of Yahweh, and ye have been — both ye and the king who had reigned over you — after Yahweh your God.
\v 15 And if ye do not hearken to the voice of Yahweh — then ye have provoked the mouth of Yahweh, and the hand of Yahweh had been against you, and against your fathers.
\v 16 'Also now, station yourselves and see this great thing which Yahweh is doing before your eyes;
\v 17 is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I call unto Yahweh, and He did give voices and rain; and know ye and see that your evil is great which ye have done in the eyes of Yahweh, to ask for you a king.'
\v 18 And Samuel called unto Yahweh, and Yahweh gave voices and rain, on that day, and all the people greatly fear Yahweh and Samuel;
\v 19 and all the people say unto Samuel, 'Pray for your servants unto Yahweh your God, and we do not die, for we have added to all our sins evil to ask for us a king.'
\v 20 And Samuel said unto the people, 'Fear not; ye have done all this evil; only, turn not aside from after Yahweh — and ye have served Yahweh with all your heart,
\v 21 and ye do not turn aside after the vain things which do not profit nor deliver, for they are vain,
\v 22 for Yahweh did not leave His people, on account of His great name; for Yahweh had been pleased to make you to Him for a people.
\v 23 'I, also, far be it from me to sin against Yahweh, by ceasing to pray for you, and I have directed you in the good and upright way;
\v 24 only, fear ye Yahweh, and ye have served Him in truth with all your heart, for see that which He had made great with you;
\v 25 and if ye really do evil, both ye and your king are consumed.'
\c 13
\v 1 A son of a year is Saul in his reigning, yea, two years he had reigned over Israel,
\v 2 and Saul chooseth for himself three yousand men out of Israel; and two yousand are with Saul in Michmash, and in the hill-country of Beth-El; and a yousand have been with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; and the remnant of the people he had sent each to his tents.
\v 3 And Jonathan smiteth the garrison of the Philistines which is in Geba, and the Philistines hear, and Saul had blown with a trumpet through all the land, saying, 'Let the Hebrews hear.'
\v 4 And all Israel have heard, saying, 'Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines,' and also, 'Israel had been abhorred by the Philistines;' and the people are called after Saul to Gilgal.
\v 5 And the Philistines have been gathered to fight with Israel; thirty yousand chariots, and six yousand horsemen, and a people as the sand which is on the sea-shore for multitude; and they come up and encamp in Michmash, east of Beth-Aven.
\v 6 And the men of Israel have seen that they are distressed, that the people had been oppressed, and the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
\v 7 And Hebrews have passed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; and Saul is yet in Gilgal, and all the people have trembled after him.
\v 8 And he waiteth seven days, according to the appointment with Samuel, and Samuel had not come to Gilgal, and the people are scattered from off him.
\v 9 And Saul said, 'Bring nigh unto me the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings;' and he caused the burnt-offering to ascend.
\v 10 And it came to pass at his completing to cause the burnt-offering to ascend, that lo, Samuel had come, and Saul went out to meet him, to bless him;
\v 11 and Samuel said, 'What hast you done?' And Saul said, 'Because I saw that the people were scattered from off me, and you hadst not come at the appointment of the days, and the Philistines are gathered to Michmash,
\v 12 and I say, Now do the Philistines come down unto me to Gilgal, and the face of Yahweh I have not appeased; and I force myself, and cause the burnt-offering to ascend.'
\v 13 And Samuel said unto Saul, 'Thou hast been foolish; you hast not kept the command of Yahweh your God, which He commanded thee, for now had Yahweh established your kingdom over Israel unto the age;
\v 14 and, now, your kingdom did not stand, Yahweh had sought for Himself a man according to His own heart, and Yahweh chargeth him for leader over His people, for you hast not kept that which Yahweh commanded thee.'
\v 15 And Samuel riseth, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin; and Saul inspecteth the people who are found with him, about six hundred men,
\v 16 and Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who are found with them, are abiding in Gibeah of Benjamin, and the Philistines have encamped in Michmash.
\v 17 And the destroyer went out from the camp of the Philistines — three detachments; the one detachment turneth unto the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
\v 18 and the one detachment turneth the way of Beth-Horon, and the one detachment turneth the way of the border which is looking on the valley of the Zeboim, toward the wilderness.
\v 19 And an artificer is not found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, 'Lest the Hebrews make sword or spear;'
\v 20 and all Israel go down to the Philistines, to sharpen each his ploughshare, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;
\v 21 and there had been the file for mattocks, and for coulters, and for three-pronged rakes, and for the axes, and to set up the goads.
\v 22 And it had been, in the day of battle, that there had not been found sword and spear in the hand of any of the people who are with Saul and with Jonathan — and there is found to Saul and to Jonathan his son.
\v 23 And the station of the Philistines went out unto the passage of Michmash.
\c 14
\v 1 And the day came that Jonathan son of Saul said unto the young man bearing his weapons, 'Come, and we pass over unto the station of the Philistines, which is on the other side of this;' and to his father he had not declared it.
\v 2 And Saul is abiding at the extremity of Gibeah, under the pomegranate which is in Migron, and the people who are with him, about six hundred men,
\v 3 and Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of I-Chabod, son of Phinehas son of Eli priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, bearing an ephod; and the people knew not that Jonathan had gone.
\v 4 And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass over unto the station of the Philistines is the edge of a rock on the one side, and the edge of a rock on the other side, and the name of the one is Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\v 5 The one edge is fixed on the north over-against Michmash, and the one on the south over-against Gibeah.
\v 6 And Jonathan said unto the young man bearing his weapons, 'Come, and we pass over unto the station of these uncircumcised; it may be Yahweh did work for us, for there is no restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.'
\v 7 And the bearer of his weapons said to him, 'Do all that is in your heart; turn for thee; lo, I am with thee, as yours own heart.'
\v 8 And Jonathan said, 'Lo, we are passing over unto the men, and are revealed unto them;
\v 9 if thus they say unto us, 'Stand still till we have come unto you,' then we have stood in our place, and do not go up unto them;
\v 10 and if thus they say, 'Come up against us,' then we have gone up, for Yahweh had given them into our hand, and this to us is the sign.
\v 11 And revealed are both of them unto the station of the Philistines, and the Philistines say, 'Lo, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves.'
\v 12 And the men of the station answer Jonathan, and the bearer of his weapons, and say, 'Come up unto us, and we cause you to know something.' And Jonathan said unto the bearer of his weapons, 'Come up after me, for Yahweh had given them into the hand of Israel.'
\v 13 And Jonathan went up on his hands, and on his feet, and the bearer of his weapons after him; and they fall before Jonathan, and the bearer of his weapons is putting to death after him.
\v 14 And the first smiting which Jonathan and the bearer of his weapons have smitten is of about twenty men, in about half a furrow of a yoke of a field,
\v 15 and there is a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people, the station and the destroyers have trembled — even they, and the earth shaketh, and it became a trembling of God.
\v 16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin see, and lo, the multitude had melted away, and it went on, and is beaten down.
\v 17 And Saul said to the people who are with him, 'Inspect, I pray you, and see; who had gone from us?' and they inspect, and lo, Jonathan and the bearer of his weapons are not.
\v 18 And Saul said to Ahiah, 'Bring nigh the ark of God;' for the ark of God had been on that day with the sons of Israel.
\v 19 And it came to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest, that the noise which is in the camp of the Philistines went on, going on and becoming great, and Saul said unto the priest, 'Remove your hand.'
\v 20 And Saul is called, and all the people who are with him, and they come in unto the battle, and, lo, the sword of each had been against his neighbour — a very great destruction.
\v 21 And the Hebrews who have been for the Philistines as heretofore, who had gone up with them into the camp, have turned round, even they, to be with Israel who are with Saul and Jonathan,
\v 22 and all the men of Israel, who are hiding themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, have heard that the Philistines have fled, and they pursue — even they — after them in battle.
\v 23 And Yahweh saveth Israel on that day, and the battle had passed over to Beth-Aven.
\v 24 And the men of Israel have been distressed on that day, and Saul adjureth the people, saying, 'Cursed is the man who eateth food till the evening, and I have been avenged of mine enemies;' and none of the people had tasted food.
\v 25 And all they of the land have come into a forest, and there is honey on the face of the field;
\v 26 and the people come in unto the forest, and lo, the honey dropped, and none is moving his hand unto his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
\v 27 And Jonathan had not heard of his father's adjuring the people, and putteth forth the end of the rod, which is in his hand, and dippeth it in the honeycomb, and brought back his hand unto his mouth — and his eyes see!
\v 28 And a man of the people answereth and said, 'Your father certainly adjured the people, saying, Cursed is the man who eateth food to-day; and the people are weary.'
\v 29 And Jonathan said, 'My father had troubled the land; see, I pray you, that mine eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.
\v 30 How much more if the people had well eaten to-day of the spoil of its enemies which it had found, for now, the smiting had not been great among the Philistines.'
\v 31 And they smite on that day among the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people are very weary,
\v 32 and the people make unto the spoil, and take sheep, and oxen, and sons of the herd, and slaughter on the earth, and the people eat with the blood.
\v 33 And they declare to Saul, saying, 'Lo, the people are sinning against Yahweh, to eat with the blood.' And he said, 'Ye have dealt treacherously, roll unto me to-day a great stone.'
\v 34 And Saul said, 'Be ye scattered among the people, and ye have said to them, Bring ye nigh unto me each his ox, and each his sheep; and ye have killed them in this place, and eaten, and ye do not sin against Yahweh to eat with the blood.' And all the people bring nigh each his ox, in his hand, that night, and slaughter them there.
\v 35 And Saul built an alter to Yahweh; with it he had begun to build altars to Yahweh.
\v 36 And Saul said, 'Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and we prey upon them till the light of the morning, and leave not a man of them.' And they say, 'All that is good in yours eyes do.' And the priest said, 'Let us draw near hither unto God.'
\v 37 And Saul asketh of God, 'Do I go down after the Philistines? will Thou give them into the hand of Israel?' and He had not answered him on that day.
\v 38 And Saul said, 'Draw ye nigh hither all, the chiefs of the people, and know and see in what this sin had been to-day;
\v 39 for, Yahweh lived, who is saving Israel: surely if it be in Jonathan my son, surely he did certainly die;' and none is answering him out of all the people.
\v 40 And he said unto all Israel, 'Ye — ye are on one side, and I and Jonathan my son are on another side;' and the people say unto Saul, 'That which is good in yours eyes do.'
\v 41 And Saul said unto Yahweh, God of Israel, 'Give perfection;' and Jonathan and Saul are captured, and the people went out.
\v 42 And Saul said, 'Cast between me and Jonathan my son;' and Jonathan is captured.
\v 43 And Saul said unto Jonathan, 'Declare to me, what hast you done?' and Jonathan declareth to him, and said, 'I certainly tasted with the end of the rod that is in my hand a little honey; lo, I die!'
\v 44 And Saul said, 'Thus did God do, and thus did He add, for you will certainly die, Jonathan.'
\v 45 And the people say unto Saul, 'Doth Jonathan die who wrought this great salvation in Israel? — a profanation! Yahweh lived, if there falleth from the hair of his head to the earth, for with God he had wrought this day;' and the people rescue Jonathan, and he had not died.
\v 46 And Saul went up from after the Philistines, and the Philistines have gone to their place;
\v 47 and Saul captured the kingdom over Israel, and he fighteth round about against all his enemies, against Moab, and against the Bene-Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines, and whithersoever he turneth he did vex them.
\v 48 And he made a force, and smiteth Amalek, and delivereth Israel out of the hand of its spoiler.
\v 49 And the sons of Saul are Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-Shua; as to the name of his two daughters, the name of the first-born is Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;
\v 50 and the name of the wife of Saul is Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the head of his host is Abner son of Ner, uncle of Saul;
\v 51 and Kish is father of Saul, and Ner father of Abner is son of Ahiel.
\v 52 And the war is severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul; when Saul had seen any mighty man, and any son of valour, then he did gather him unto himself.
\c 15
\v 1 And Samuel said unto Saul, 'Me did Yahweh send to anoint thee for king over His people, over Israel; and now, hearken to the voice of the words of Yahweh:
\v 2 'Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, I have looked after that which Amalek did to Israel, that which he laid for him in the way in his going up out of Egypt.
\v 3 Now, go, and you hast smitten Amalek, and devoted all that it had, and you hast no pity on it, and hast put to death from man unto woman, from infant unto suckling, from ox unto sheep, from camel unto ass.'
\v 4 And Saul summoneth the people, and inspecteth them in Telaim, two hundred yousand footmen, and ten yousand are men of Judah.
\v 5 And Saul came in unto a city of Amalek, and laid wait in a valley;
\v 6 and Saul said unto the Kenite, 'Go, turn aside, go down from the middle of Amalek, lest I consume thee with it, and you did kindness with all the sons of Israel, in their going up out of Egypt;' and the Kenite turneth aside from the middle of Amalek.
\v 7 And Saul smiteth Amalek from Havilah — your going in to Shur, which is on the front of Egypt,
\v 8 and he catcheth Agag king of Amalek alive, and all the people he had devoted by the mouth of the sword;
\v 9 and Saul had pity — also the people — on Agag, and on the best of the flock, and of the herd, and of the seconds, and on the lambs, and on all that is good, and have not been willing to devote them; and all the work, despised and wasted — it they devoted.
\v 10 And the word of Yahweh is unto Samuel, saying,
\v 11 'I have repented that I caused Saul to reign for king, for he had turned back from after Me, and My words he had not performed;' and it is displeasing to Samuel, and he crieth unto Yahweh all the night.
\v 12 And Samuel riseth early to meet Saul in the morning, and it is declared to Samuel, saying, 'Saul had come in to Carmel, and lo, he is setting up to himself a monument, and went round, and passeth over, and went down to Gilgal.'
\v 13 And Samuel came in unto Saul, and Saul said to him, 'Blessed art you of Yahweh; I have performed the word of Yahweh.'
\v 14 And Samuel said, 'And what is the noise of this flock in mine ears — and the noise of the herd which I am hearing?'
\v 15 And Saul said, 'From Amalek they have brought them, because the people had pity on the best of the flock, and of the herd, in order to sacrifice to Yahweh your God, and the remnant we have devoted.'
\v 16 And Samuel said unto Saul, 'Desist, and I declare to thee that which Yahweh had spoken unto me to-night;' and he said to him, 'Speak.'
\v 17 And Samuel said, 'Art not you, if you art little in yours own eyes, head of the tribes of Israel? and Yahweh did anoint thee for king over Israel,
\v 18 and Yahweh sent thee in the way, and said, Go, and you hast devoted the sinners, the Amalekite, and fought against them till they are consumed;
\v 19 and why hast you not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh — and will fly unto the spoil, and will do the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh?'
\v 20 And Saul said unto Samuel, 'Because — I have hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, and I go in the way which Yahweh had sent me, and bring in Agag king of Amalek, and Amalek I have devoted;
\v 21 and the people taketh of the spoil of the flock and herd, the first part of the devoted thing, for sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.'
\v 22 And Samuel said, 'Hath Yahweh had delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in hearkening to the voice of Yahweh? lo, hearkening than sacrifice is better; to give attention than fat of rams;
\v 23 for a sin of divination is rebellion, and iniquity and teraphim is stubbornness; because you hast rejected the word of Yahweh, He also did reject thee from being king.'
\v 24 And Saul said unto Samuel, 'I have sinned, for I passed over the command of Yahweh, and your words; because I have feared the people, I also hearken to their voice;
\v 25 and now, bear, I pray thee, with my sin, and turn back with me, and I bow myself to Yahweh.'
\v 26 And Samuel said unto Saul, 'I do not turn back with thee; for you hast rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh did reject thee from being king over Israel.'
\v 27 And Samuel turneth round to go, and he laid hold on the skirt of his upper robe — and it is rent!
\v 28 And Samuel said unto him, 'Yahweh had rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and given it to your neighbour who is better than you;
\v 29 and also, the Pre-eminence of Israel did not lie nor repent, for He is not a man to be penitent.'
\v 30 And he said, 'I have sinned; now, honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn back with me; and I have bowed myself to Yahweh your God.'
\v 31 And Samuel turneth back after Saul, and Saul boweth himself to Yahweh;
\v 32 and Samuel said, 'Bring ye nigh unto me Agag king of Amalek,' and Agag came unto him daintily, and Agag said, 'Surely the bitterness of death had turned aside.'
\v 33 And Samuel said, 'As your sword bereaved women — so is your mother bereaved above women;' and Samuel heweth Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.
\v 34 And Samuel went to Ramath, and Saul had gone unto his house — to Gibeah of Saul.
\v 35 And Samuel had not added to see Saul till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul, and Yahweh repented that He had caused Saul to reign over Israel.
\c 16
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Samuel, 'Till when art you mourning for Saul, and I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I send thee unto Jesse the Beth-Lehemite, for I have seen among his sons for Myself a king.
\v 2 And Samuel said, 'How do I go? when Saul had heard, then he had killed me.' And Yahweh said, 'A heifer of the herd you will take in your hand, and hast said, To sacrifice to Yahweh I have come;
\v 3 and you hast called for Jesse in the sacrifice, and I cause thee to know that which you will do, and you hast anointed to Me him of whom I speak unto thee.'
\v 4 And Samuel did that which Yahweh had spoken, and came in to Beth-Lehem, and the elders of the city tremble to meet him, and one said, 'Is your coming peace?'
\v 5 and he said, 'Peace; to sacrifice to Yahweh I have come, sanctify yourselves, and ye have come in with me to the sacrifice;' and he sanctifieth Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\v 6 And it came to pass, in their coming in, that he saw Eliab, and said, 'Surely, before Yahweh is His anointed.'
\v 7 And Yahweh said unto Samuel, 'Look not unto his appearance, and unto the height of his stature, for I have rejected him; for it is not as man saw — for man looketh at the eyes, and Yahweh looketh at the heart.'
\v 8 And Jesse called unto Abinadab, and caused him to pass by before Samuel; and he said, 'Also on this Yahweh had not fixed.'
\v 9 And Jesse caused Shammah to pass by, and he said, 'Also on this Yahweh had not fixed.'
\v 10 And Jesse caused seven of his sons to pass by before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, 'Yahweh had not fixed on these.'
\v 11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, 'Are the young men finished?' and he said, 'Yet had been left the youngest; and lo, he delighteth himself among the flock;' and Samuel said unto Jesse, 'Send and take him, for we do not turn round till his coming in hither.'
\v 12 And he sent, and brought him in, and he is ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and of good appearance; and Yahweh said, 'Rise, anoint him, for this is he.'
\v 13 And Samuel taketh the horn of oil, and anointeth him in the middle of his brethren, and prosper over David did the Spirit of Yahweh from that day and onwards; and Samuel riseth and went to Ramath.
\v 14 And the Spirit of Yahweh turned aside from Saul, and a spirit of sadness from Yahweh terrified him;
\v 15 and the servants of Saul say unto him, 'Lo, we pray thee, a spirit of sadness from God is terrifying thee;
\v 16 let our lord command, we pray thee, your servants before thee, they seek a skilful man, playing on a harp, and it had come to pass, in the spirit of sadness from God being upon thee, that he had played with his hand, and it is well with thee.'
\v 17 And Saul said unto his servants, 'Provide, I pray you, for me a man playing well — then ye have brought him in unto me.'
\v 18 And one of the servants answereth and said, 'Lo, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-Lehemite, skilful in playing, and a mighty virtuous man, and a man of battle, and intelligent in word, and a man of form, and Yahweh is with him.'
\v 19 And Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, 'Send unto me David your son, who is with the flock.'
\v 20 And Jesse taketh an ass, with bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent by the hand of David his son unto Saul.
\v 21 And David came in unto Saul, and standeth before him, and he loveth him greatly; and he is a bearer of his weapons.
\v 22 And Saul sent unto Jesse, saying, 'Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he had found grace in mine eyes.'
\v 23 And it had come to pass, in the spirit of sadness from God being on Saul, that David had taken the harp, and played with his hand, and Saul had refreshment and gladness, and the spirit of sadness had turned aside from off him.
\c 17
\v 1 And the Philistines gather their camps to battle, and are gathered to Shochoh, which is to Judah, and encamp between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-Dammim;
\v 2 and Saul and the men of Israel have been gathered, and encamp by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array to meet the Philistines.
\v 3 And the Philistines are standing on the mountain on this side, and the Israelites are standing on the mountain on that side, and the valley is between them.
\v 4 And there went out a man of the duellists from the camps of the Philistines, Goliath is his name, from Gath; his height is six cubits and a span,
\v 5 and a helmet of brass is on his head, and with a scaled coat of mail he is clothed, and the weight of the coat of mail is five yousand shekels of brass,
\v 6 and a frontlet of brass is on his feet, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders,
\v 7 and the wood of his spear is like a beam of weavers', and the flame of his spear is six hundred shekels of iron, and the bearer of the buckler is going before him.
\v 8 And he standeth and called unto the ranks of Israel, and said to them, 'Why are ye come out to set in array the battle? am not I the Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose for you a man, and let him come down unto me;
\v 9 if he be able to fight with me, and have smitten me, then we have been to you for servants; and if I am able for him, and have smitten him, then ye have been to us for servants, and have served us.'
\v 10 And the Philistine said, 'I have reproached the ranks of Israel this day; give to me a man, and we fight together.'
\v 11 And Saul heareth — and all Israel — these words of the Philistine, and they are broken down and greatly afraid.
\v 12 And David is son of this Ephrathite of Beth-Lehem-Judah, whose name is Jesse, and he had eight sons, and the man in the days of Saul had become aged among men;
\v 13 and the three eldest sons of Jesse go, they have gone after Saul to battle; and the name of his three sons who have gone into battle are Eliab the first-born, and his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\v 14 And David is the youngest, and the three eldest have gone after Saul,
\v 15 and David is going and returning from Saul, to feed the flock of his father at Beth-Lehem.
\v 16 And the Philistine draweth nigh, morning and evening, and stationeth himself forty days.
\v 17 And Jesse said to David his son, 'Take, I pray thee, to your brethren, an ephah of this roasted corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to your brethren;
\v 18 and these ten cuttings of the cheese you will take in to the head of the yousand, and your brethren you will inspect for welfare, and their pledge will receive.'
\v 19 And Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\v 20 And David riseth early in the morning, and leaveth the flock to a keeper, and lifteth up, and went, as Jesse commanded him, and he came in to the path, and to the force which is going out unto the rank, and they have shouted for battle;
\v 21 and Israel and the Philistines set in array rank to meet rank.
\v 22 And David letteth down the goods from off him on the hand of a keeper of the goods, and runneth into the rank, and came and asketh of his brethren of welfare.
\v 23 And he is speaking with them, and lo, a man of the duellists is coming up, Goliath the Philistine is his name, of Gath, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and he spoke according to those words, and David heareth;
\v 24 and all the men of Israel when they see the man flee from his presence, and are greatly afraid.
\v 25 And the men of Israel say, 'Have ye seen this man who is coming up? for, to reproach Israel he is coming up, and it had been — the man who smiteth him, the king did enrich him with great riches, and his daughter he did give to him, and his father's house did make free in Israel.'
\v 26 And David spoke unto the men who are standing by him, saying, 'What is done to the man who smiteth this Philistine, and had turned aside reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he had reproached the ranks of the living God?'
\v 27 And the people speak to him according to this word, saying, 'Thus it is done to the man who smiteth him.'
\v 28 And Eliab, his eldest brother, heareth when he spoke unto the men, and the anger of Eliab burneth against David, and he said, 'Why is this — you hast come down! and to whom hast you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I have known your pride, and the evil of your heart — for, to see the battle you hast come down.'
\v 29 And David said, 'What have I done now? is it not a word?'
\v 30 And he turneth round from him unto another, and said according to this word, and the people return him word as the first word.
\v 31 And the words which David had spoken are heard, and they declare before Saul, and he receiveth him;
\v 32 and David said unto Saul, 'Let no man's heart fall because of him, your servant did go, and had fought with this Philistine.'
\v 33 And Saul said unto David, 'Thou art not able to go unto this Philistine, to fight with him, for a youth you art, and he a man of war from his youth.'
\v 34 And David said unto Saul, 'A shepherd had your servant been to his father among the sheep, and the lion had come — and the bear — and had taken away a sheep out of the drove,
\v 35 and I have gone out after him, and smitten him, and delivered out of his mouth, and he riseth against me, and I have taken hold on his beard, and smitten him, and put him to death.
\v 36 Both the lion and the bear had your servant smitten, and this uncircumcised Philistine had been as one of them, for he had reproached the ranks of the living God.'
\v 37 And David said, 'Yahweh, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He did deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.' And Saul said unto David, 'Go, and Yahweh is with thee.'
\v 38 And Saul clotheth David with his long robe, and had put a helmet of brass on his head, and did clothe him with a coat of mail.
\v 39 And David girded his sword above his long robe, and beginneth to go, for he had not tried it; and David said unto Saul, 'I am not able to go with these, for I had not tried;' and David turneth them aside from off him.
\v 40 And he taketh his staff in his hand, and chooseth for him five smooth stones from the brook, and putteth them in the shepherds' habiliments that he had, even in the scrip, and his sling is in his hand, and he draweth nigh unto the Philistine.
\v 41 And the Philistine went on, going and drawing near unto David, and the man bearing the buckler is before him,
\v 42 and the Philistine looketh attentively, and saw David, and despiseth him, for he was a youth, and ruddy, with a fair appearance.
\v 43 And the Philistine said unto David, 'Am I a dog that you art coming unto me with staves?' and the Philistine revileth David by his gods,
\v 44 and the Philistine said unto David, 'Come unto me, and I give your flesh to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the field.'
\v 45 And David said unto the Philistine, 'Thou art coming unto me with sword, and with spear, and with buckler, and I am coming unto thee in the name of Yahweh of Hosts, God of the ranks of Israel, which you hast reproached.
\v 46 This day did Yahweh shut thee up into my hand — and I have smitten thee, and turned aside your head from off thee, and given the carcase of the camp of the Philistines this day to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the earth, and all the earth do know that God is for Israel.
\v 47 and all this assembly do know that not by sword and by spear did Yahweh save, that the battle is Yahweh's, and He had given you into our hand.'
\v 48 And it had come to pass, that the Philistine had risen, and went, and draweth near to meet David, and David hasteth and runneth to the rank to meet the Philistine,
\v 49 and David putteth forth his hand unto the vessel, and taketh there a stone, and slingeth, and smiteth the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sinketh into his forehead, and he falleth on his face to the earth.
\v 50 And David is stronger than the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smiteth the Philistine, and putteth him to death, and there is no sword in the hand of David,
\v 51 and David runneth and standeth over the Philistine, and taketh his sword, and draweth it out of its sheath, and putteth him to death, and cutteth off with it his head; and the Philistines see that their hero is dead, and flee.
\v 52 And the men of Israel rise — also Judah — and shout, and pursue the Philistines till you enter the valley, and unto the gates of Ekron, and the wounded of the Philistines fall in the way of Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron,
\v 53 and the sons of Israel turn back from burning after the Philistines, and spoil their camps.
\v 54 And David taketh the head of the Philistine, and brought it in to Jerusalem, and his weapons he had put in his own tent.
\v 55 And when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he had said unto Abner, head of the host, 'Whose son is this — the youth, Abner?' and Abner said, 'Your soul lived, O king, I have not known.'
\v 56 And the king said, 'Ask you whose son this is — the young man.'
\v 57 And when David turneth back from smiting the Philistine, then Abner taketh him and brought him in before Saul, and the head of the Philistine in his hand;
\v 58 and Saul said unto him, 'Whose son art you, O youth?' and David said, 'Son of your servant Jesse, the Beth-Lehemite.'
\c 18
\v 1 And it came to pass, when he finisheth to speak unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan had been bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loveth him as his own soul.
\v 2 And Saul taketh him on that day, and had not permitted him to turn back to the house of his father.
\v 3 And Jonathan made — also David — a covenant, because he loveth him as his own soul,
\v 4 and Jonathan strippeth himself of the upper robe which is upon him, and gave it to David, and his long robe, even unto his sword, and unto his bow, and unto his girdle.
\v 5 And David went out whithersoever Saul did send him; he acted wisely, and Saul setteth him over the men of war, and it is good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.
\v 6 And it came to pass, in their coming in, in David's returning from smiting the Philistine, that the women come out from all the cities of Israel to sing — also the dancers — to meet Saul the king, with tabrets, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments;
\v 7 and the women answer — those playing, and say, 'Saul had smitten among his yousands, And David among his myriads.'
\v 8 And it is displeasing to Saul exceedingly, and this thing is evil in his eyes, and he said, 'They have given to David myriads, and to me they have given the yousands, and more to him is only the kingdom;'
\v 9 and Saul is eyeing David from that day and thereforth.
\v 10 And it came to pass, on the morrow, that the spirit of sadness from God prospereth over Saul, and he prophesieth in the middle of the house, and David is playing with his hand, as day by day, and the javelin is in the hand of Saul,
\v 11 and Saul threw the javelin, and said, 'I smite through David, even through the wall;' and David turneth round out of his presence twice.
\v 12 And Saul is afraid of the presence of David, for Yahweh had been with him, and from Saul He had turned aside;
\v 13 and Saul turneth him aside from him, and appointeth him to himself head of a yousand, and he went out an came in, before the people.
\v 14 And David is in all his ways acting wisely, and Yahweh is with him,
\v 15 and Saul saw that he is acting very wisely, and is afraid of him,
\v 16 and all Israel and Judah love David when he is going out and coming in before them.
\v 17 And Saul said unto David, 'Lo, my elder daughter Merab — her I give to thee for a wife; only, be to me for a son of valour, and fight the battles of Yahweh;' and Saul said, 'Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.'
\v 18 And David said unto Saul, 'Who am I? and what my life — the family of my father in Israel — that I am son-in-law to the king?'
\v 19 And it came to pass, at the time of the giving of Merab daughter of Saul to David, that she had been given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
\v 20 And Michal daughter of Saul loveth David, and they declare to Saul, and the thing is right in his eyes,
\v 21 and Saul said, 'I give her to him, and she is to him for a snare, and the hand of the Philistines is on him;' and Saul said unto David, 'By the second — you will become my son-in-law to-day.'
\v 22 And Saul commandeth his servants, 'Speak unto David gently, saying, Lo, the king had delighted in thee, and all his servants have loved thee, and now, be son-in-law to the king.'
\v 23 And the servants of Saul speak in the ears of David these words, and David said, 'Is it a light thing in your eyes to be son-in-law to the king — and I a poor man, and lightly esteemed?'
\v 24 And the servants of Saul declare to him, saying, 'According to these words had David spoken.'
\v 25 And Saul said, 'Thus do ye say to David, There is no delight to the king in dowry, but in a hundred foreskins of the Philistines — to be avenged on the enemies of the king;' and Saul yought to cause David to fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\v 26 And his servants declare to David these words, and the thing is right in the eyes of David, to be son-in-law to the king; and the days have not been full,
\v 27 and David riseth and went, he and his men, and smiteth among the Philistines two hundred men, and David brought in their foreskins, and they set them before the king, to be son-in-law to the king; and Saul gave to him Michal his daughter for a wife.
\v 28 And Saul saw and knoweth that Yahweh is with David, and Michal daughter of Saul had loved him,
\v 29 and Saul addeth to be afraid of the presence of David yet; and Saul is an enemy with David all the days.
\v 30 And the princes of the Philistines come out, and it came to pass from the time of their coming out, David had acted more wisely than any of the servants of Saul, and his name is very precious.
\c 19
\v 1 And Saul spoke unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his servants, to put David to death,
\v 2 and Jonathan son of Saul delighted exceedingly in David, and Jonathan declareth to David, saying, 'Saul my father is seeking to put thee to death, and, now, take heed, I pray thee, in the morning, and you hast abode in a secret place, and been hidden,
\v 3 and I — I go out, and have stood by the side of my father in the field where you art, and I speak of thee unto my father, and have seen what is coming, and have declared to thee.'
\v 4 And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, 'Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he had not sinned against thee, and because his works for thee are very good;
\v 5 yea, he putteth his life in his hand, and smiteth the Philistine, and Yahweh worketh a great salvation for all Israel; you hast seen, and will rejoice, and why will you sin against innocent blood, to put David to death for nought?'
\v 6 And Saul hearkeneth to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul sweareth, 'Yahweh lived — he did not die.'
\v 7 And Jonathan called for David, and Jonathan declareth to him all these words, and Jonathan brought in David unto Saul, and he is before him as heretofore.
\v 8 And there addeth to be war, and David went out and fighteth against the Philistines, and smiteth among them — a great smiting, and they flee from his face.
\v 9 And a spirit of sadness from Yahweh is unto Saul, and he is sitting in his house, and his javelin in his hand, and David is playing with the hand,
\v 10 and Saul seeketh to smite with the javelin through David, and through the wall, and he freeth himself from the presence of Saul, and he smiteth the javelin through the wall; and David had fled and escapeth during that night.
\v 11 And Saul sent messengers unto the house of David to watch him, and to put him to death in the morning; and Michal his wife declareth to David, saying, 'If you art not delivering your life to-night — tomorrow you art put to death.'
\v 12 And Michal caused David to go down through the window, and he went on, and fleeth, and escapeth;
\v 13 and Michal taketh the teraphim, and laid on the bed, and the mattress of goats' hair she had put for his pillows, and covereth with a garment.
\v 14 And Saul sent messengers to take David, and she said, 'He is sick.'
\v 15 And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, 'Bring him up in the bed unto me,' — to put him to death.
\v 16 And the messengers come in, and lo, the teraphim are on the bed, and the mattress of goats' hair, for his pillows.
\v 17 And Saul said unto Michal, 'Why thus hast you deceived me — that you will send away mine enemy, and he is escaped?' and Michal said unto Saul, 'He said unto me, Send me away: why do I put thee to death?'
\v 18 And David had fled, and is escaped, and came in unto Samuel to Ramath, and declareth to him all that Saul had done to him, and he went, he and Samuel, and they dwell in Naioth.
\v 19 And it is declared to Saul, saying, 'Lo, David is in Naioth in Ramah.'
\v 20 And Saul sent messengers to take David, and they see the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing, set over them, and the Spirit of God is on Saul's messengers, and they prophesy — they also.
\v 21 And they declare it to Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they prophesy — they also; and Saul addeth and sent messengers a third time, and they prophesy — they also.
\v 22 And he went — he also — to Ramath, and came in unto the great well which is in Sechu, and asketh, and said, 'Where are Samuel and David?' and one said, 'Lo, in Naioth in Ramah.'
\v 23 And he went thither — unto Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God is upon him — him also; and he went, going on, and he prophesieth till his coming in to Naioth in Ramah,
\v 24 and he strippeth off — he also — his garments, and prophesieth — he also — before Samuel, and falleth down naked all that day and all the night; therefore they say, 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'
\c 20
\v 1 And David fleeth from Naioth in Ramah, and came, and said before Jonathan, 'What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?'
\v 2 And he said to him, 'Far be it! you will not die; lo, my father did not do anything great or small and did not uncover mine ear; and wherefore did my father hide from me this thing? this thing is not.'
\v 3 And David sweareth again, and said, 'Your father had certainly known that I have found grace in yours eyes, and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved; and yet, Yahweh lived, and your soul lived, but — as a step between me and death.'
\v 4 And Jonathan said to David, 'What did your soul say? — and I do it for thee.'
\v 5 And David said unto Jonathan, 'Lo, the new moon is to-morrow; and I do certainly sit with the king to eat; and you hast sent me away, and I have been hidden in a field till the third evening;
\v 6 if your father at all look after me, and you hast said, David asked earnestly of me to run to Beth-Lehem his city, for a sacrifice of the days is there for all the family.
\v 7 If thus he say: Good; peace is for your servant; and if it be very displeasing to him — know that the evil had been determined by him;
\v 8 and you hast done kindness, to your servant, for into a covenant of Yahweh you hast brought your servant with thee; — and if there is in me iniquity, put you me to death; and unto your father, why is this — you will bring me in?'
\v 9 And Jonathan said, 'Far be it from thee! for I certainly do not know that the evil had been determined by my father to come upon thee, and I do not declare it to thee.'
\v 10 And David said unto Jonathan, 'Who did declare to me? or what if your father did answer thee sharply?'
\v 11 And Jonathan said unto David, 'Come, and we go out into the field;' and they go out both of them into the field.
\v 12 And Jonathan said unto David, 'Yahweh, God of Israel — when I search my father, about this time to-morrow or the third day, and lo, good is towards David, and I do not then send unto thee, and have uncovered yours ear — 
\v 13 thus did Yahweh do to Jonathan, and thus did He add; when the evil concerning thee is good to my father, then I have uncovered yours ear, and sent thee away, and you hast gone in peace, and Yahweh is with thee, as he was with my father;
\v 14 and not only while I am alive will you do with me the kindness of Yahweh, and I die not,
\v 15 but you will not cut off your kindness from my house unto the age, nor in Yahweh's cutting off the enemies of David, each one from off the face of the ground.'
\v 16 And Jonathan covenanteth with the house of David, and Yahweh had sought it from the hand of the enemies of David;
\v 17 and Jonathan addeth to cause David to swear, because he loveth him, for with the love of his own soul he had loved him.
\v 18 And Jonathan said to him, 'To-morrow is new moon, and you hast been looked after, for your seat is looked after;
\v 19 and on the third day you will certainly come down, and hast come in unto the place where you wast hidden in the day of the work, and hast remained near the stone Ezel.
\v 20 'And I shoot three of the arrows at the side, sending out for myself at a mark;
\v 21 and lo, I send the youth: Go, find the arrows. If I at all say to the youth, Lo, the arrows are on this side of thee — take them, — then come you, for peace is for thee, and there is nothing; Yahweh lived.
\v 22 And if thus I say to the young man, Lo, the arrows are beyond thee, — go, for Yahweh had sent thee away;
\v 23 as to the thing which we have spoken, I and you, lo, Yahweh is between me and thee — unto the age.'
\v 24 And David is hidden in the field, and it is the new moon, and the king sitteth down by the food to eat,
\v 25 and the king sitteth on his seat, as time by time, on a seat by the wall, and Jonathan riseth, and Abner sitteth at the side of Saul, and David's place is looked after.
\v 26 And Saul had not spoken anything on that day, for he said, 'It is an accident; he is not clean — surely not clean.'
\v 27 And it came to pass on the second morrow of the new moon, that David's place is looked after, and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, 'Wherefore had the son of Jesse not come in, either yesterday or to-day, unto the food?'
\v 28 And Jonathan answereth Saul, 'David had been earnestly asked of me unto Beth-Lehem,
\v 29 and he said, Send me away, I pray thee, for a family sacrifice we have in the city, and my brother himself had given command to me, and now, if I have found grace in yours eyes, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren; therefore he had not come unto the table of the king.'
\v 30 And the anger of Saul burneth against Jonathan, and he said to him, 'Son of a perverse rebellious woman! have I not known that you art fixing on the son of Jesse to your shame, and to the shame of the nakedness of your mother?
\v 31 for all the days that the son of Jesse lived on the ground you art not established, you and your kingdom; and now, send and bring him unto me, for he is a son of death.'
\v 32 And Jonathan answereth Saul his father, and said unto him, 'Why is he put to death? what had he done?'
\v 33 And Saul threw the javelin at him to smite him, and Jonathan knoweth that it had been determined by his father to put David to death.
\v 34 And Jonathan riseth from the table in the heat of anger, and had not eaten food on the second day of the new moon, for he had been grieved for David, for his father put him to shame.
\v 35 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little youth is with him.
\v 36 And he said to his youth, 'Run, find, I pray thee, the arrows which I am shooting;' the youth is running, and he had shot the arrow, causing it to pass over him.
\v 37 And the youth came unto the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, and Jonathan called after the youth, and said, 'Is not the arrow beyond thee?'
\v 38 and Jonathan called after the youth, 'Speed, haste, stand not;' and Jonathan's youth gathereth the arrows, and came unto his lord.
\v 39 And the youth had not known anything, only Jonathan and David knew the word.
\v 40 And Jonathan gave his weapons unto the youth whom he had, and said to him, 'Go, carry into the city.'
\v 41 The youth had gone, and David had risen from Ezel, at the south, and falleth on his face to the earth, and boweth himself three times, and they kiss one another, and they weep one with another, till David exerted himself;
\v 42 and Jonathan said to David, 'Go in peace, in that we have sworn — we two — in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh is between me and thee, and between my seed and your seed — unto the age;' and he riseth and went; and Jonathan had gone in to the city.
\c 21
\v 1 And David came in to Nob, unto Ahimelech the priest, and Ahimelech trembleth at meeting David, and said to him, 'Wherefore art you yourself alone, and no man with thee?'
\v 2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, 'The king had commanded me a matter, and he said unto me, Let no man know anything of the matter about which I am sending thee, and which I have commanded thee; and the young men I have caused to know at such and such a place;
\v 3 and now, what is there under your hand? five loaves give into my hand, or that which is found.'
\v 4 And the priest answereth David, and said, 'There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if the youths have been kept only from women.'
\v 5 And David answereth the priest, and said to him, 'Surely, if women have been restrained from us as heretofore in my going out, then the vessels of the young men are holy, and it is a common way: and also, surely to-day it is sanctified in the vessel.'
\v 6 And the priest gave to him the holy thing, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which is turned aside from the presence of Yahweh to put hot bread in the day of its being taken away.
\v 7 And there is a man of the servants of Saul on that day detained before Yahweh, and his name is Doeg the Edomite, chief of the shepherds whom Saul had.
\v 8 And David said to Ahimelech, 'And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? for neither my sword nor my vessels have I taken in my hand, for the matter of the king was urgent.'
\v 9 And the priest said, 'The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you did smite in the valley of Elah, lo, it is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod, if it you will take to yourself, take; for there is none other save it in this place.' And David said, 'There is none like it — give it to me.'
\v 10 And David riseth and fleeth on that day from the face of Saul, and came in unto Achish king of Gath;
\v 11 and the servants of Achish say unto him, 'Is not this David king of the land? is it not of this one they sing in dances, saying, 'Saul smote among his yousands, and David among his myriads?'
\v 12 And David laid these words in his heart, and is exceedingly afraid of the face of Achish king of Gath,
\v 13 and changeth his behaviour before their eyes, and feigneth himself mad in their hand, and scribbleth on the doors of the gate, and letteth down his spittle unto his beard.
\v 14 And Achish said unto his servants, 'Lo, ye see a man acting as a madman; why do ye bring him in unto me?
\v 15 A lack of madmen have I, that ye have brought in this one to act as a madman by me! did this one come in unto my house?'
\c 22
\v 1 And David went there, and is escaped unto the cave of Adullam, and his brethren hear, and all the house of his father, and go down unto him thither;
\v 2 and gather themselves unto him do every man in distress, and every man who had an exactor, and every man bitter in soul, and he is over them for head, and there are with him about four hundred men.
\v 3 And David went there to Mizpeh of Moab, and said unto the king of Moab, 'Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother go out with you, till that I know what God did for me;'
\v 4 and he leadeth them before the king of Moab, and they dwell with him all the days of David's being in the fortress.
\v 5 And Gad the prophet said unto David, 'Thou will not abide in a fortress, go, and you hast entered for thee the land of Judah;' and David went and entereth the forest of Hareth.
\v 6 And Saul heareth that David had become known, and the men who are with him, and Saul is abiding in Gibeah, under the grove in Ramah, and his spear is in his hand, and all his servants standing by him.
\v 7 And Saul said to his servants who are standing by him, 'Hear, I pray you, ye Benjamites; also to all of you did the son of Jesse give fields and vineyards! all of you he did appoint heads of yousands and heads of hundreds!
\v 8 for ye have conspired all of you against me, and there is none uncovering mine ear about my son's covenanting with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you grieving for me, and uncovering mine ear, that my son had raised up my servant against me, to lie in wait as at this day.'
\v 9 And answer did Doeg the Edomite, who is set over the servants of Saul, and said, 'I have seen the son of Jesse coming in to Nob, unto Ahimelech son of Ahitub,
\v 10 and he asketh for him at Yahweh, and provision had given to him, and the sword of Goliath the Philistine had given to him.
\v 11 And the king sent to call Ahimelech son of Ahitub, the priest, and all the house of his father, the priests, who are in Nob, and they come all of them unto the king;
\v 12 and Saul said, 'Hear, I pray thee, son of Ahitub;' and he said, 'Here am I, my lord.'
\v 13 And Saul said unto him, 'Why have ye conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, by your giving to him bread and a sword, and to ask for him at God, to rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?'
\v 14 And Ahimelech answereth the king and said, 'And who among all your servants is as David — faithful, and son-in-law of the king, and had turned aside unto your council, and is honoured in your house?
\v 15 To-day have I begun to ask for him at God? far be it from me! let not the king lay anything against his servant, against any of the house of my father, for your servant had known nothing of all this, less or more.'
\v 16 And the king said, 'Thou will surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all the house of your father.'
\v 17 And the king said to runners, those standing by him, 'Turn round, and put to death the priests of Yahweh, because their hand also is with David, and because they have known that he is fleeing, and have not uncovered mine ear;' and the servants of the king have not been willing to put forth their hand to come against the priests of Yahweh.
\v 18 And the king said to Doeg, 'Turn round you, and come against the priests;' and Doeg the Edomite turneth round, and came himself against the priests, and putteth to death in that day eighty and five men bearing a linen ephod,
\v 19 and Nob, the city of the priests, he had smitten by the mouth of the sword, from man even unto woman, from infant even unto suckling, and ox, and ass, and sheep, by the mouth of the sword.
\v 20 And there escapeth one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, and his name is Abiathar, and he fleeth after David,
\v 21 and Abiathar declareth to David that Saul had killed the priests of Yahweh.
\v 22 And David said to Abiathar, 'I have known on that day when Doeg the Edomite is there, that he did certainly declare it to Saul; I have brought it round to every person of the house of your father;
\v 23 dwell with me; fear not; for he who seeketh my life seeketh your life; for a charge art you with me.'
\c 23
\v 1 And they declare to David, saying, 'Lo, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are spoiling the threshing-floors.'
\v 2 And David asketh at Yahweh, saying, 'Do I go? — and have I smitten among these Philistines?' And Yahweh said unto David, 'Go, and you hast smitten among the Philistines, and saved Keilah.'
\v 3 And David's men say unto him, 'Lo, we here in Judah are afraid; and how much more when we go to Keilah, unto the ranks of the Philistines?'
\v 4 And David addeth again to ask at Yahweh, and Yahweh answereth him, and said, 'Rise, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand.'
\v 5 And David went, and his men, to Keilah, and fighteth with the Philistines, and leadeth away their cattle, and smiteth among them — a great smiting, and David saveth the inhabitants of Keilah.
\v 6 And it came to pass, in the fleeing of Abiathar son of Ahimelech unto David, to Keilah, an ephod came down in his hand.
\v 7 And it is declared to Saul that David had come in to Keilah, and Saul said, 'God had made him known for my hand, for he had been shut in, to enter into a city of doors and bar.'
\v 8 And Saul summoneth the whole of the people to battle, to go down to Keilah, to lay siege unto David and unto his men.
\v 9 And David knoweth that against him Saul is devising the evil, and said unto Abiathar the priest, 'Bring nigh the ephod.'
\v 10 And David said, 'Yahweh, God of Israel, Your servant had certainly heard that Saul is seeking to come in unto Keilah, to destroy the city on mine account.
\v 11 Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up into his hand? did Saul come down as Your servant had heard? Yahweh, God of Israel, declare, I pray Thee, to Your servant.' And Yahweh said, 'He did come down.'
\v 12 And David said, 'Do the possessors of Keilah shut me up, and my men, into the hand of Saul?' And Yahweh said, 'They shut thee up.'
\v 13 And David riseth — and his men — about six hundred men, and they go out from Keilah, and go up and down where they go up and down; and to Saul it had been declared that David had escaped from Keilah, and he ceaseth to go out.
\v 14 And David abideth in the wilderness, in fortresses, and abideth in the hill-country, in the wilderness of Ziph; and Saul seeketh him all the days, and God had not given him into his hand.
\v 15 And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life, and David is in the wilderness of Ziph, in a forest.
\v 16 And Jonathan son of Saul riseth, and went unto David to the forest, and strengtheneth his hand in God,
\v 17 and said unto him, 'Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father did not find thee, and you will reign over Israel, and I am to thee for second, and also so knoweth Saul my father.'
\v 18 And they make a covenant both of them before Yahweh; and David abideth in the forest, and Jonathan had gone to his house.
\v 19 And the Ziphites go up unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, 'Is not David hiding himself with us in fortresses, in the forest, in the height of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desolate place?
\v 20 And, now, by all the desire of your soul, O king, to come down, come down, and ours is to shut him up into the hand of the king.'
\v 21 And Saul said, 'Blessed are ye of Yahweh, for ye have pity on me;
\v 22 go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his foot is; who had seen him there? for one had said unto me, He is very subtile.
\v 23 And see and know of all the hiding-places where he hideth himself, and ye have turned back unto me prepared, and I have gone with you, and it had been, if he is in the land, that I have searched him out through all the yousands of Judah.'
\v 24 And they rise and go to Ziph before Saul, and David and his men are in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain, at the south of the desolate place.
\v 25 And Saul and his men go to seek, and they declare to David, and he went down the rock, and abideth in the wilderness of Maon; and Saul heareth, and pursueth after David to the wilderness of Maon.
\v 26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain, and David is hastened to go from the face of Saul, and Saul and his men are compassing David and his men, to catch them.
\v 27 And a messenger had come in unto Saul, saying, 'Haste, and come, for the Philistines have pushed against the land.'
\v 28 And Saul turneth back from pursuing after David, and went to meet the Philistines, therefore they have called that place 'The Rock of Divisions.'
\v 29 And David went up there, and abideth in fortresses at En-gedi.
\c 24
\v 1 And it came to pass when Saul had turned back from after the Philistines, that they declare to him, saying, 'Lo, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.'
\v 2 And Saul taketh three yousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men, on the front of the rocks of the wild goats,
\v 3 and he came in unto folds of the flock, on the way, and there is a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet; and David and his men in the sides of the cave are abiding.
\v 4 And the men of David say unto him, 'Lo, the day of which Yahweh said unto thee, Lo, I am giving yours enemy into your hand, and you hast done to him as it is good in yours eyes;' and David riseth and cutteth off the skirt of the upper robe which is on Saul — gently.
\v 5 And it came to pass afterwards that the heart of David smiteth him, because that he had cut off the skirt which is on Saul,
\v 6 and he said to his men, 'Far be it from me, by Yahweh; I do not do this thing to my lord — to the anointed of Yahweh — to put forth my hand against him, for the anointed of Yahweh he is.'
\v 7 And David subdueth his men by words, and had not permitted them to rise against Saul; and Saul had risen from the cave, and went on the way;
\v 8 and David riseth afterwards, and went out from the cave, and called after Saul, saying, 'My lord, O king!' And Saul looketh attentively behind him, and David boweth — face to the earth — and did obeisance.
\v 9 And David said to Saul, 'Why will you hear the words of man, saying, Lo, David is seeking yours evil?
\v 10 Lo, this day have yours eyes seen how that Yahweh had given thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and one said to slay thee, and mine eye had pity on thee, and I say, I do not put forth my hand against my lord, for the anointed of Yahweh he is.
\v 11 'And, my father, see, yea see the skirt of yours upper robe in my hand; for by cutting off the skirt of your upper robe, and I have not killed thee, know and see that there is not in my hand evil and transgression, and I have not sinned against thee, and you art hunting my soul to take it!
\v 12 'Yahweh did judge between me and thee, and Yahweh had avenged me of thee, and my hand is not on thee;
\v 13 as said the simile of the ancients, From the wicked went out wickedness, and my hand is not on thee.
\v 14 After whom had the king of Israel come out? after whom art you pursuing? — after a dead dog! after one flea!
\v 15 And Yahweh had been for judge, and had judged between me and thee, yea, he saw and pleadeth my cause, and did deliver me out of your hand.'
\v 16 And it came to pass, when David completed to speak these words unto Saul, that Saul said, 'Is this your voice, my son David?' and Saul lifteth up his voice, and weepeth.
\v 17 And he said unto David, 'More righteous you art than I; for you hast done me good, and I have done thee evil;
\v 18 and you hast declared to-day how that you hast done good with me, how that Yahweh shut me up into your hand, and you did not slay me,
\v 19 and that a man did find his enemy, and had sent him away in a good manner; and Yahweh did repay thee good for that which you did to me this day.
\v 20 'And, now, lo, I have known that you will certainly reign, and the kingdom of Israel had stood in your hand;
\v 21 and, now, swear to me by Yahweh — you will not cut off my seed after me, nor will you destroy my name from the house of my father.'
\v 22 And David sweareth to Saul, and Saul went unto his house, and David and his men have gone up unto the fortress.
\c 25
\v 1 And Samuel dieth, and all Israel are gathered, and mourn for him, and bury him in his house, in Ramah; and David riseth and went down unto the wilderness of Paran.
\v 2 And there is a man in Maon, and his work is in Carmel; and the man is very great, and he had three yousand sheep, and a yousand goats; and he is shearing his flock in Carmel.
\v 3 And the name of the man is Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail, and the woman is of good understanding, and of fair form, and the man is hard and evil in doings; and he is a Calebite.
\v 4 And David heareth in the wilderness that Nabal is shearing his flock,
\v 5 and David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, 'Go ye up to Carmel, and ye have come in unto Nabal, and asked of him in my name of welfare,
\v 6 and said thus: To life! and you, peace; and your house, peace; and all that you hast — peace!
\v 7 and, now, I have heard that you hast shearers; now, the shepherds whom you hast have been with us, we have not put them to shame, nor had anything been looked after by them, all the days of their being in Carmel.
\v 8 'Ask your young men, and they declare to thee, and the young men find grace in yours eyes, for on a good day we have come; give, I pray thee, that which your hand findeth, to your servants, and to your son, to David.'
\v 9 And the young men of David come in, and speak unto Nabal according to all these words, in the name of David — and rest.
\v 10 And Nabal answereth the servants of David and said, 'Who is David, and who the son of Jesse? to-day have servants been multiplied who are breaking away each from his master;
\v 11 and I have taken my bread, and my water, and my flesh, which I slaughtered for my shearers, and have given it to men whom I have not known whence they are!'
\v 12 And the young men of David turn on their way, and turn back, and come in, and declare to him according to all these words.
\v 13 And David said to his men, 'Gird ye on each his sword;' and they gird on each his sword, and David also girdeth on his sword, and there go up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred have remained by the vessels.
\v 14 And to Abigail wife of Nabal had one young man of the youths declared, saying, 'Lo, David had sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our lord, and he flieth upon them;
\v 15 and the men are very good to us, and have not put us to shame, and we have not looked after anything all the days we have gone up and down with them, in our being in the field;
\v 16 a wall they have been unto us both by night and by day, all the days of our being with them, feeding the flock.
\v 17 And, now, know and consider what you will; for evil had been determined against our lord, and against all his house, and he is too much a son of worthlessness to be spoken to.'
\v 18 And Abigail hasteth, and taketh two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep, prepared, and five measures of roasted corn, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred bunches of figs, and setteth them on the asses.
\v 19 And she said to her young men, 'Pass over before me; lo, after you I am coming;' and to her husband Nabal she had not declared it;
\v 20 and it had come to pass, she is riding on the ass and is coming down in the secret part of the hill-country, and lo, David and his men are coming down to meet her, and she meeteth them.
\v 21 And David said, 'Only, in vain I have kept all that this one had in the wilderness, and nothing had been looked after of all that he had, and he turneth back to me evil for good;
\v 22 thus did God do to the enemies of David, and thus He did add, if I leave of all that he had till the light of the morning — of those sitting on the wall.'
\v 23 And Abigail saw David, and hasteth and came down from off the ass, and falleth before David on her face, and boweth herself to the earth,
\v 24 and falleth at his feet and said, 'On me, my lord, the iniquity; and let, I pray thee, your handmaid speak in yours ear, and hear the words of your handmaid.
\v 25 Let not, I pray thee, my lord set his heart to this man of worthlessness, on Nabal, for as his name is so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; and I, yours handmaid, did not see the young men of my lord whom you did send;
\v 26 and now, my lord, Yahweh lived, and your soul lived, in that Yahweh had withheld thee from coming in with blood, and to save your hand to thee — now let yours enemies be as Nabal, even those seeking evil unto my lord.
\v 27 And, now, this blessing which your maid-servant had brought to my lord — it had been given to the young men who are going up and down at the feet of my lord.
\v 28 Bear, I pray thee, with the transgression of your handmaid, for Yahweh did certainly make to my lord a stedfast house; for the battles of Yahweh had my lord fought, and evil is not found in thee all your days.
\v 29 And man riseth to pursue thee and to seek your soul, and the soul of my lord had been bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God; as to the soul of yours enemies, He did sling them out in the middle of the hollow of the sling.
\v 30 'And it had been, when Yahweh did to my lord according to all the good which He had spoken concerning thee, and appointed thee for leader over Israel,
\v 31 that this is not to thee for a stumbling-block, and for an offence of heart to my lord — either to shed blood for nought, or my lord's restraining himself; and Yahweh had done good to my lord, and you hast remembered your handmaid.'
\v 32 And David said to Abigail, 'Blessed is Yahweh, God of Israel, who had sent thee this day to meet me,
\v 33 and blessed is your discretion, and blessed art you in that you hast restrained me this day from coming in with blood, and to restrain my hand to myself.
\v 34 And yet, Yahweh lived, God of Israel, who had kept me back from doing evil with thee, for unless you hadst hasted, and will come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal till the light of the morning, of those sitting on the wall.'
\v 35 And David receiveth from her hand that which she had brought to him, and to her he had said, 'Go up in peace to your house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and accept your face.'
\v 36 And Abigail came in unto Nabal, and lo, he had a banquet in his house, like a banquet of the king, and the heart of Nabal is glad within him, and he is drunk unto excess, and she had not declared to him anything, less or more, till the light of the morning.
\v 37 And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine is gone out from Nabal, that his wife declareth to him these things, and his heart dieth within him, and he had been as a stone.
\v 38 And it came to pass, in about ten days, that Yahweh smiteth Nabal, and he dieth,
\v 39 and David heareth that Nabal is dead, and said, 'Blessed is Yahweh who had pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and His servant had kept back from evil, and the wickedness of Nabal had Yahweh turned back on his own head;' and David sent and spoke with Abigail, to take her to him for a wife.
\v 40 And the servants of David come in unto Abigail at Carmel, and speak unto her, saying, 'David had sent us unto thee to take thee to him for a wife.'
\v 41 And she riseth and boweth herself — face to the earth — and said, 'Lo, your handmaid is for a maid-servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.'
\v 42 And Abigail hasteth and riseth, and rideth on the ass; and five of her young women who are going at her feet; and she went after the messengers of David, and is to him for a wife.
\v 43 And Ahinoam had David taken from Jezreel, and they are — even both of them — to him for wives;
\v 44 and Saul gave Michal his daughter, wife to David, to Phalti son of Laish, who is of Gallim.
\c 26
\v 1 And the Ziphites come in unto Saul, at Gibeah, saying, 'Is not David hiding himself in the height of Hachilah, on the front of the desert?'
\v 2 And Saul riseth, and went down unto the wilderness of Ziph, and with him three yousand men, chosen ones of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\v 3 And Saul encampeth in the height of Hachilah, which is on the front of the desert, by the way, and David is abiding in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul had come after him in to the wilderness;
\v 4 and David sent spies, and knoweth that Saul had come unto Nachon,
\v 5 and David riseth, and came in unto the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul had lain, and Abner son of Ner, head of his host, and Saul is lying in the path, and the people are encamping round about him.
\v 6 And David answereth and said unto Ahimelech the Hittite, and unto Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, 'Who did go down with me unto Saul, unto the camp?' and Abishai said, 'I — I go down with thee.'
\v 7 And David came — and Abishai — unto the people by night, and lo, Saul is lying sleeping in the path, and his spear struck into the earth at his pillow, and abner and the people are lying round about him.
\v 8 And Abishai said unto David, 'God had shut up to-day yours enemy into your hand; and, now, let me smite him, I pray thee, with a spear, even into the earth at once — and I do repeat it to him.'
\v 9 And David said unto Abishai, 'Destroy him not; for who had put forth his hand against the anointed of Yahweh, and been acquitted?'
\v 10 And David said, 'Yahweh lived; except Yahweh did smite him, or his day come that he had died, or into battle he go down, and had been consumed — 
\v 11 far be it from me, by Yahweh, from putting forth my hand against the anointed of Yahweh; and, now, take, I pray thee, the spear which is at his pillow, and the cruse of water, and we go away.'
\v 12 And David taketh the spear, and the cruse of water at the pillow of Saul, and they go away, and there is none seeing, and there is none knowing, and there is none awaking, for all of them are sleeping, for a deep sleep from Yahweh had fallen upon them.
\v 13 And David passeth over to the other side, and standeth on the top of the hill afar off — great is the place between them;
\v 14 and David called unto the people, and unto Abner son of Ner, saying, 'Dost you not answer, Abner?' and Abner answereth and said, 'Who art you who hast called unto the king?'
\v 15 And David said unto Abner, 'Art not you a man? and who is like thee in Israel? but why hast you not watched over your lord the king? for one of the people had come in to destroy the king, your lord.
\v 16 Not good is this thing which you hast done; Yahweh lived, but ye are sons of death, in that ye have not watched over your lord, over the anointed of Yahweh; and now, see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water which is at his bolster.'
\v 17 And Saul discerneth the voice of David, and said, 'Is this your voice, my son David?' and David said, 'My voice, my lord, O king!'
\v 18 and he said, 'Why is this — my lord is pursuing after his servant? for what have I done, and what is in my hand evil?
\v 19 And, now, let, I pray thee, my lord the king hear the words of his servant: if Yahweh had moved thee against me, let Him accept a present; and if the sons of men — cursed are they before Yahweh, for they have cast me out to-day from being admitted into the inheritance of Yahweh, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\v 20 And now, let not my blood fall to the earth over-against the face of Yahweh, for the king of Israel had come out to seek one flea, as one pursueth the partridge in mountains.'
\v 21 And Saul said, 'I have sinned; turn back, my son David, for I do evil to thee no more, because that my soul had been precious in yours eyes this day; lo, I have acted foolishly, and do err very greatly.'
\v 22 And David answereth and said, 'Lo, the king's spear; and let one of the young men pass over, and receive it;
\v 23 and Yahweh did turn back to each his righteousness and his faithfulness, in that Yahweh had given thee to-day into my hand, and I have not been willing to put forth my hand against the anointed of Yahweh,
\v 24 and lo, as your soul had been great this day in mine eyes, so is my soul great in the eyes of Yahweh, and He did deliver me out of all distress.'
\v 25 And Saul said unto David, 'Blessed art you, my son David, also working you will work, and also prevailing you will prevail.' And David went on his way, and Saul had turned back to his place.
\c 27
\v 1 And David said unto his heart, 'Now am I consumed one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing for me better than that I diligently escape unto the land of the Philistines, and Saul had been despairing of me — of seeking me any more in all the border of Israel, and I have escaped out of his hand.'
\v 2 And David riseth, and passeth over, he and six hundred men who are with him, unto Achish son of Maoch king of Gath;
\v 3 and David dwelleth with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each one with his household, even David and his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelitess.
\v 4 And it is declared to Saul that David had fled to Gath, and he had not added any more to seek him.
\v 5 And David said unto Achish, 'If, I pray thee, I have found grace in yours eyes, they give to me a place in one of the cities of the field, and I dwell there, yea, why did your servant dwell in the royal city with thee?'
\v 6 And Achish gave to him in that day Ziklag, therefore had Ziklag been to the kings of Judah till this day.
\v 7 And the number of the days which David had dwelt in the field of the Philistines is days and four months;
\v 8 and David went up and his men, and they push unto the Geshurite, and the Gerizite, and the Amalekite, (for they are inhabitants of the land from of old), as you comest in to Shur and unto the land of Egypt,
\v 9 and David had smitten the land, and did not keep alive man and woman, and had taken sheep, and oxen, and asses, and camels, and garments, and turneth back, and came in unto Achish.
\v 10 And Achish said, 'Whither have ye pushed to-day?' and David said, 'Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelite, and unto the south of the Kenite.'
\v 11 Neither man nor woman did David keep alive, to bring in word to Gath, saying, 'Lest they declare it against us, saying, Thus had David done, and thus is his custom all the days that he had dwelt in the fields of the Philistines.'
\v 12 And Achish believeth in David, saying, 'He had made himself utterly abhorred among his people, in Israel, and had been to me for a servant age-during.'
\c 28
\v 1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gather their camps for the war, to fight against Israel, and Achish said unto David, 'Thou will certainly know that with me you will go out into the camp, you and your men.'
\v 2 And David said unto Achish, 'Therefore — you will know that which your servant will do.' And Achish said unto David, 'Therefore — keeper of my head I do appoint thee all the days.'
\v 3 And Samuel had died, and all Israel mourn for him, and bury him in Ramah, even in his city, and Saul had turned aside those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\v 4 And the Philistines are gathered, and come in, and encamp in Shunem, and Saul gathereth all Israel, and they encamp in Gilboa,
\v 5 and Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and feareth, and his heart trembleth greatly,
\v 6 and Saul asketh at Yahweh, and Yahweh had not answered him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.
\v 7 And Saul said to his servants, 'Seek for me a woman possessing a familiar spirit, and I go unto her, and inquire of her;' and his servants say unto him, 'Lo, a woman possessing a familiar spirit in En-dor.'
\v 8 And Saul disguiseth himself and putteth on other garments, and went, he and two of the men with him, and they come in unto the woman by night, and he said, 'Divine, I pray thee, to me by the familiar spirit, and cause to come up to me him whom I say unto thee.'
\v 9 And the woman said unto him, 'Lo, you hast known that which Saul had done, that he had cut off those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; and why art you laying a snare for my soul — to put me to death?'
\v 10 And Saul sweareth to her by Yahweh, saying, 'Yahweh lived, punishment did not meet thee for this thing.'
\v 11 And the woman said, 'Whom do I bring up to thee?' and he said, 'Samuel — bring up to me.'
\v 12 And the woman saw Samuel, and crieth with a loud voice, and the woman spoke unto Saul, saying, 'Why hast you deceived me — and you Saul?'
\v 13 And the king said to her, 'Do not fear; for what hast you seen?' and the woman said unto Saul, 'Gods I have seen coming up out of the earth.'
\v 14 And he said to her, 'What is his form?' and she said, 'An aged man is coming up, and he is covered with an upper robe;' and Saul knoweth that he is Samuel, and boweth — face to thee earth — and did obeisance.
\v 15 And Samuel said unto Saul, 'Why hast you troubled me, to bring me up?' And Saul said, 'I have great distress, and the Philistines are fighting against me, God had turned aside from me, and had not answered me any more, either by the hand of the prophets, or by dreams; and I call for thee to let me know what I do.'
\v 16 And Samuel said, 'And why will you ask me, and Yahweh had turned aside from thee, and is yours enemy?
\v 17 And Yahweh did for Himself as He had spoken by my hand, and Yahweh rendeth the kingdom out of your hand, and gave it to your neighbour — to David.
\v 18 Because you hast not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, nor did the fierceness of His anger on Amalek — therefore this thing had Yahweh done to thee this day;
\v 19 yea, Yahweh gave also Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons are with me; also the camp of Israel did Yahweh give into the hand of the Philistines.'
\v 20 And Saul hasteth and falleth — the fulness of his stature — to the earth, and feareth greatly because of the words of Samuel; also power was not in him, for he had not eaten bread all the day, and all the night.
\v 21 And the woman came in unto Saul, and saw that he had been greatly troubled, and said unto him, 'Lo, your maid-servant had hearkened to your voice, and I put my soul in my hand, and I obey your words which you hast spoken unto me;
\v 22 and now, hearken, I pray thee, also you, to the voice of your maid-servant, and I set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and there is in thee power when you goest in the way.'
\v 23 And he refuseth, and said, 'I do not eat;' and his servants urge on him, and also the woman, and he hearkeneth to their voice, and riseth from the earth, and sitteth on the bed.
\v 24 And the woman had a calf of the stall in the house, and she hasteth and slaughtereth it, and taketh flour, and kneadeth, and baketh it unleavened things,
\v 25 and brought nigh before Saul, and before his servants, and they eat, and rise, and go on, during that night.
\c 29
\v 1 And the Philistines gather all their camps to Aphek, and the Israelites are encamping at a fountain which is in Jezreel,
\v 2 and the princes of the Philistines are passing on by hundreds, and by yousands, and David and his men are passing on in the rear with Achish.
\v 3 And the heads of the Philistines say, 'What are these Hebrews?' and Achish said unto the heads of the Philistines, 'Is not this David servant of Saul king of Israel, who had been with me these days or these years, and I have not found in him anything wrong from the day of his falling away till this day.'
\v 4 And the heads of the Philistines are wroth against him, and the heads of the Philistines say to him, 'Send back the man, and he did turn back unto his place whither you hast appointed him, and did not go down with us into battle, and is not to us for an adversary in battle; and wherewith did this one reconcile himself unto his lord — is it not with the heads of those men?'
\v 5 Is not this David, of whom they answer in choruses, saying, Saul had smitten among his yousands, and David among his myriads?'
\v 6 And Achish called unto David, and said unto him, 'Yahweh lived, surely you art upright, and good in mine eyes is your going out, and your coming in, with me in the camp, for I have not found in thee evil from the day of your coming in unto me till this day; and in the eyes of the princes you art not good;
\v 7 and now, turn back, and go in peace, and you will do no evil in the eyes of the princes of the Philistines.'
\v 8 And David said unto Achish, 'But what have I done? and what hast you found in your servant from the day that I have been before thee till this day — that I go not in and have fought against the enemies of my lord the king?'
\v 9 And Achish answereth and said unto David, 'I have known that you art good in mine eyes as a messenger of God; only, the princes of the Philistines have said, He did not go up with us into battle;
\v 10 and now, rise you early in the morning, and the servants of your lord who have come with thee, when ye have risen early in the morning, and have light, then go ye.'
\v 11 And David riseth early, he and his men, to go in the morning, to turn back unto the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines have gone up to Jezreel.
\c 30
\v 1 And it came to pass, in the coming in of David and his men to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites have pushed unto the south, and unto Ziklag, and smite Ziklag, and burn it with fire,
\v 2 and they take captive the women who are in it; from small unto great they have not put any one to death, and they lead away, and go on their way.
\v 3 And David came in — and his men — unto the city, and lo, burnt with fire, and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters have been taken captive!
\v 4 And David lifteth up — and the people who are with him — their voice and weep, till that they have no power to weep.
\v 5 And the two wives of David have been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
\v 6 and David had great distress, for the people have said to stone him, for the soul of all the people had been bitter, each for his sons and for his daughters; and David did strengthen himself in Yahweh his God.
\v 7 And David said unto Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, 'Bring nigh, I pray thee, to me the ephod;' and Abiathar brought nigh the ephod unto David,
\v 8 and David asketh at Yahweh, saying, 'I pursue after this troop — do I overtake it?' And He said to him, 'Pursue, for you will certainly overtake, and will certainly deliver.'
\v 9 And David went on, he and six hundred men who are with him, and they come in unto the brook of Besor, and those left have stood still,
\v 10 and David pursueth, he and four hundred men, (and two hundred men stand still who have been too faint to pass over the brook of Besor),
\v 11 and they find a man, an Egyptian, in the field, and take him unto David, and give to him bread, and he eateth, and they cause him to drink water,
\v 12 and give to him a piece of a bunch of dried figs, and two bunches of raisins, and he eateth, and his spirit returneth unto him, for he had not eaten bread nor drunk water three days and three nights.
\v 13 And David said to him, 'Whose art you? and whence art you?' And he said, 'An Egyptian youth I am, servant to a man, an Amalekite, and my lord forsaketh me, for I have been sick three days,
\v 14 we pushed to the south of the Cherethite, and against that which is to Judah, and against the south of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned with fire.'
\v 15 And David said unto him, 'Dost you bring me down unto this troop?' and he said, 'Swear to me by God — you will not put me to death, nor will you shut me up into the hand of my lord — and I bring thee down unto this troop.'
\v 16 And he brought him down, and lo, they are spread out over the face of all the earth, eating, and drinking, and feasting, with all the great spoil which they have taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
\v 17 And David smiteth them from the twilight even unto the evening of the morrow, and there had not escaped of them a man, except four hundred young men who have ridden on the camels, and are fled.
\v 18 And David delivereth all that the Amalekites have taken; also his two wives had David delivered.
\v 19 And there had not lacked to them anything, from small unto great, and unto sons and daughters, and from the spoil, even unto all that they had taken to themselves, the whole had David brought back,
\v 20 and David taketh the whole of the flock, and of the herd, they have led on before these cattle, and they say, 'This is David's spoil.'
\v 21 And David came in unto the two hundred men who were too faint to go after David, and whom they cause to abide at the brook of Besor, and they go out to meet David, and to meet the people who are with him, and David approacheth the people, and asketh of them of welfare.
\v 22 And every bad and worthless man, of the men who have gone with David, answereth, yea, they say, 'Because that they have not gone with us we do not give to them of the spoil which we have delivered, except each his wife and his children, and they lead away and go.
\v 23 And David said, 'Ye do not do so, my brethren, with that which Yahweh had given to us, and He did preserve us, and did give the troop which came against us into our hand;
\v 24 and who did hearken to you in this thing? for as the portion of him who was brought down into battle, so also is the portion of him who is abiding by the vessels — alike they share.'
\v 25 And it came to pass from that day and forward, that he appointeth it for a statute and for an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
\v 26 And David came in unto Ziklag, and sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, (saying, 'Lo, for you a blessing, of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh),'
\v 27 to those in Beth-El, and to those in South Ramoth, and to those in Jattir,
\v 28 and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,
\v 29 and to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
\v 30 and to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-Ashan, and to those in Athach,
\v 31 and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David had gone up and down, he and his men.
\c 31
\v 1 And the Philistines are fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel flee from the face of the Philistines, and fall wounded in mount Gilboa,
\v 2 and the Philistines follow Saul and his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, sons of Saul.
\v 3 And the battle is hard against Saul, and the archers find him — men with bow — and he is pained greatly by the archers;
\v 4 and Saul said to the bearer of his weapons, 'Draw your sword, and pierce me with it, lest they come — these uncircumcised — and have pierced me, and rolled themselves on me;' and the bearer of his weapons had not been willing, for he is greatly afraid, and Saul taketh the sword, and falleth upon it.
\v 5 And the bearer of his weapons saw that Saul is dead, and he falleth — he also — on his sword, and dieth with him;
\v 6 and Saul dieth, and three of his sons, and the bearer of his weapons, also all his men, on that day together.
\v 7 And they see — the men of Israel, who are beyond the valley, and who are beyond the Jordan — that the men of Israel have fled, and that Saul and his sons have died, and they forsake the cities and flee, and Philistines come in, and dwell in them.
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines come to strip the wounded, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa,
\v 9 and they cut off his head, and strip off his weapons, and send into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim tidings in the house of their idols, and among the people;
\v 10 and they place his weapons in the house of Ashtaroth, and his body they have fixed on the wall of Beth-Shan.
\v 11 And they hear regarding it — the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead — that which the Philistines have done to Saul,
\v 12 and all the men of valour arise, and go all the night, and take the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Beth-Shan, and come in to Jabesh, and burn them there,
\v 13 and they take their bones, and bury them under the tamarisk in Jabesh, and fast seven days.
