\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, saying:
\v 2 Take ye up the sum of all the company of the sons of Israel by their families, by the house of their fathers, in the number of names — every male by their polls;
\v 3 from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host in Israel, ye do number them by their hosts, you and Aaron;
\v 4 and with you there is a man for a tribe, each is a head to the house of his fathers.

\v 47 And the Levites, for the tribe of their fathers, have not numbered themselves in their middle,

\v 50 and you, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all that it had; they bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels, and they serve it; and round about the tabernacle they encamp.
\v 51 'And in the journeying of the tabernacle, the Levites take it down, and in the encamping of the tabernacle, the Levites raise it up; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'
\v 52 And the sons of Israel have encamped, each by his camp, and each by his standard, by their hosts;

\c 2

\v 1 And these are births of Aaron and Moses, in the day of Yahweh's speaking with Moses in mount Sinai.
\v 2 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: the first-born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar;
\v 3 these are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whose hand he had consecrated for acting as priest.
\v 4 And Nadab dieth — Abihu also — before Yahweh, in their bringing near strange fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and sons they had not; and Eleazar — Ithamar also — acteth as priest in the presence of Aaron their father.
\v 5 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 6 'Bring near the tribe of Levi, and you hast caused it to stand before Aaron the priest, and they have served him,
\v 7 and kept his charge, and the charge of all the company before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle;
\v 8 and they have kept all the vessels of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle;
\v 9 and you hast given the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are surely given to him out of the sons of Israel.
\v 10 'And Aaron and his sons you will appoint, and they have kept their priesthood, and the stranger who came near is put to death.'
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 12 'And I, lo, I have taken the Levites from the middle of the sons of Israel instead of every first-born opening a womb among the sons of Israel, and the Levites have been Mine;
\v 13 for Mine is every first-born, in the day of My smiting every first-born in the land of Egypt I have sanctified to Myself every first-born in Israel, from man unto beast; Mine they are; I am Yahweh.'
\v 14 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
\v 15 'Number the sons of Levi by the house of their fathers, by their families; every male from a son of a month and upward you will number them.'
\v 16 And Moses numbereth them according to the command of Yahweh, as he had been commanded.
\v 17 And these are sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohad, and Merari.
\v 18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
\v 19 And the sons of Kohad, by their families, are Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
\v 20 And the sons of Merari by their families are Mahli and Mushi; these are the families of the Levites, by the house of their fathers.

\v 23 The families of the Gershonite, behind the tabernacle, do encamp westward.
\v 24 And the prince of a father's house for the Gershonite is Eliasaph son of Lael.
\v 25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting is the tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the vail at the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 26 and the hangings of the court, and the vail at the opening of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and its cords, to all its service.
\v 27 And of Kohad is the family of the Amramite, and the family of the Izharite, and the family of the Hebronite, and the family of the Uzzielite; these are families of the Kohadite.
\v 28 In number, all the males, from a son of a month and upward, are eight yousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
\v 29 The families of the sons of Kohad encamp by the side of the tabernacle southward.
\v 30 And the prince of a father's house for the families of the Kohadite is Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
\v 31 And their charge is the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary with which they serve, and the vail, and all its service.
\v 32 And to the prince of the princes of the Levites, Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, is the oversight of the keepers of the charge of the sanctuary.

\v 37 and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.
\v 38 And those encamping before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting, at the east, are Moses and Aaron, and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the sons of Israel, and the stranger who came near is put to death.
\v 39 All those numbered of the Levites whom Moses numbered — Aaron also — by the command of Yahweh, by their families, every male from a son of a month and upward, are two and twenty yousand.
\v 40 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Number every first-born male of the sons of Israel from a son of a month and upward, and take up the number of their names;
\v 41 and you hast taken the Levites for Me (I am Yahweh), instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of every firstling among the cattle of the sons of Israel.'
\v 42 And Moses numbereth, as Yahweh had commanded him, all the first-born among the sons of Israel.
\v 43 And all the first-born — male — by the number of names, from a son of a month and upward, of their numbered ones, are two and twenty yousand two hundred and seventy and three.
\v 44 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 45 Take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites have been Mine; I am Yahweh.
\v 46 And from those ransomed of the two hundred and seventy and three (who are more than the Levites) of the first-born of the sons of Israel,
\v 47 you hast even taken five shekels a-piece by the poll — by the shekel of the sanctuary you takest; twenty gerahs the shekel is;
\v 48 and you hast given the money to Aaron, and to his sons, whereby those over and above are ransomed.'
\v 49 And Moses taketh the ransom money from those over and above those ransomed by the Levites;
\v 50 from the first-born of the sons of Israel he had taken the money, a yousand and three hundred and sixty and five — by the shekel of the sanctuary;
\v 51 and Moses gave the money of those ransomed to Aaron, and to his sons, according to the command of Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\c 4
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 2 'Take up the sum of the sons of Kohad from the middle of the sons of Levi, by their families, by the house of their fathers;
\v 3 from a son of thirty years and upward, even till a son of fifty years, every one going in to the host, to do work in the tent of meeting.
\v 4 This is the service of the sons of Kohad in the tent of meeting, the holy of holies:
\v 5 that Aaron and his sons have come in, in the journeying of the camp, and have taken down the vail of the hanging, and have covered with it the ark of the testimony;
\v 6 and have put on it a covering of badger skin, and have spread a garment completely of blue above, and have placed its staves.
\v 7 'And on the table of the presence they spread a garment of blue, and have put on it the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and the cups of the libation, and the bread of continuity is on it,
\v 8 and they have spread over them a garment of scarlet, and have covered it with a covering of badger skin, and have placed its staves,
\v 9 and have taken a garment of blue, and have covered the candlestick of the lamp, and its lights, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, and all its oil vessels wherewith they minister to it;
\v 10 and they have put it and all its vessels unto a covering of badger skin, and have put it on the bar.
\v 11 'And on the golden altar they spread a garment of blue, and have covered it with a covering of badger skin, and have placed its staves;
\v 12 and have taken all the vessels of ministry wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and have put them unto a garment of blue, and have covered them with a covering of badger skin, and have put them on the bar,
\v 13 and have removed the ashes of the altar, and have spread over it a garment of purple;
\v 14 and have put on it all its vessels wherewith they minister about it, the censers, the hooks, and the shovels, and the bowls, all the vessels of the altar, and have spread on it a covering of badger skin, and have placed its staves:
\v 15 And Aaron had finished — his sons also — covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, in the journeying of the camp, and afterwards do the sons of Kohad come in to bear it, and they do not come unto the holy thing, that they have died; these things are the burden of the sons of Kohad in the tent of meeting.
\v 16 And the oversight of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, is the oil of the lamp, and the spice-perfume, and the present of continuity, and the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that is in it, in the sanctuary, and in its vessels.'
\v 17 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 18 'Ye do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohadite from the middle of the Levites;
\v 19 but this do to them, and they have lived, and do not die in their drawing nigh the holy of holies: — Aaron and his sons go in, and have set them, each man to his service, and unto his burden,
\v 20 and they go not in to see when the holy thing is swallowed, that they have died.'
\v 21 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 22 'Take up the sum of the sons of Gershon also by the house of their fathers, by their families;
\v 23 from a son of thirty years and upward, till a son of fifty years you will number them, every one who is going in to serve the host, to do the service in the tent of meeting.
\v 24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonite, to serve — and for burden,
\v 25 and they have borne the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of the badger skin which is on it above, and the vail at the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 26 and the hangings of the court, and the vail at the opening of the gate of the court which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the vessels of their service, and all that is made for them — and they have served.
\v 27 'By the command of Aaron and his sons is all the service of the sons of the Gershonite in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye have laid a charge on them concerning the charge of all their burden.
\v 28 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonite in the tent of meeting; and their charge is under the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
\v 29 'The sons of Merari, by their families, by the house of their fathers, you will number them;
\v 30 from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years you will number them, every one who is going in to the host, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 31 And this is the charge of their burden, of all their service in the tent of meeting; the boards of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,
\v 32 and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, of all their vessels, and of all their service; and by name ye do number the vessels of the charge of their burden.
\v 33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, for all their service, in the tent of meeting, by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.'
\v 34 And Moses numbereth — Aaron also, and the princes of the company — the sons of the Kohadite, by their families, and by the house of their fathers,
\v 35 from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years, every one who is going in to the host, for service in the tent of meeting,
\v 36 and their numbered ones, by their families, are two yousand seven hundred and fifty.
\v 37 These are those numbered of the families of the Kohadite, every one who is serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, by the command of Yahweh, by the hand of Moses.
\v 38 And those numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families, and by the house of their fathers,
\v 39 from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years, every one who is going in to the host, for service in the tent of meeting,
\v 40 even their numbered ones, by their families, by the house of their fathers, are two yousand and six hundred and thirty.
\v 41 These are those numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, every one who is serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by the command of Yahweh.
\v 42 And those numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by the house of their fathers,
\v 43 from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years, every one who is going in to the host, for service in the tent of meeting,
\v 44 even their numbered ones, by their families, are three yousand and two hundred.
\v 45 These are those numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, by the command of Yahweh, by the hand of Moses.
\v 46 All those numbered, whom Moses numbered — Aaron also, and the princes of Israel — of the Levites, by their families, and by the house of their fathers,
\v 47 from a son of thirty years and upward even unto a son of fifty years, every one who is going in to do the work of the service, even the service of burden in the tent of meeting,
\v 48 even their numbered ones are eight yousand and five hundred and eighty;
\v 49 by the command of Yahweh had one numbered them, by the hand of Moses, each man by his service, and by his burden, with his numbered ones, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\c 5
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Command the sons of Israel, and they send out of the camp every leper, and every one with an issue, and every one defiled by a body;
\v 3 from male unto female ye do send out; unto the outside of the camp ye do send them; and they defile not their camps in the middle of which I do tabernacle.'
\v 4 And the sons of Israel do so, and they send them out unto the outside of the camp; as Yahweh had spoken unto Moses so have the sons of Israel done.
\v 5 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 6 Speak unto the sons of Israel, Man or woman, when they do any of the sins of man, by committing a trespass against Yahweh, and that person is guilty,
\v 7 and they have confessed their sin which they have done, then he had restored his guilt in its principal, and its fifth is adding to it, and had given it to him in reference to whom he had been guilty.
\v 8 And if the man have no redeemer to restore the guilt to, the guilt which is restored is Yahweh's, the priest's, apart from the ram of the atonements, whereby he made atonement for him.
\v 9 'And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they bring near to the priest, became his;
\v 10 and any man's hallowed things become his; that which any man gave to the priest became his.'
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 12 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When any man's wife turneth aside, and had committed against him a trespass,
\v 13 and a man had lain with her with the seed of copulation, and it had been hid from the eyes of her husband, and concealed, and she had been defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she had not been caught,
\v 14 and a spirit of jealousy had passed over him, and he had been jealous of his wife, and she had been defiled; — or, a spirit of jealousy had passed over him, and he had been jealous of his wife, and she had not been defiled — 
\v 15 Then had the man brought in his wife unto the priest, and he had brought in her offering for her, a tenth of the ephah of barley meal, he did not pour on it oil, nor did he put on it frankincense, for it is a present of jealousy, a present of memorial, causing remembrance of iniquity.
\v 16 'And the priest had brought her near, and had caused her to stand before Yahweh,
\v 17 and the priest had taken holy water in an earthen vessel, and of the dust which is on the floor of the tabernacle did the priest take, and had put it into the water,
\v 18 and the priest had caused the woman to stand before Yahweh, and had uncovered the woman's head, and had given into her hands the present of the memorial, it is a present of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest are the bitter waters which cause the curse.
\v 19 And the priest had caused her to swear, and had said unto the woman, If no man had lain with thee, and if you hast not turned aside to uncleanness under your husband, be free from these bitter waters which cause the curse;
\v 20 and you, if you hast turned aside under your husband, and if you hast been defiled, and any man did give his copulation to thee besides your husband — 
\v 21 (then the priest had caused the woman to swear with an oath of execration, and the priest had said to the woman) — Yahweh did give thee for an execration, and for a curse, in the middle of your people, in Yahweh's giving your thigh to fall, and your belly to swell,
\v 22 and these waters which cause the curse have gone into your bowels, to cause the belly to swell, and the thigh to fall; and the woman had said, Amen, Amen.
\v 23 And the priest had written these execrations in a book, and had blotted them out with the bitter waters,
\v 24 and had caused the woman to drink the bitter waters which cause the curse, and the waters which cause the curse have entered into her for bitter things.
\v 25 'And the priest had taken out of the hand of the woman the present of jealousy, and had waved the present before Yahweh, and had brought it near unto the altar;
\v 26 and the priest had taken a handful of the present, its memorial, and had made perfume on the altar, and afterwards did cause the woman to drink the water:
\v 27 yea, he had caused her to drink the water, and it had come to pass, if she had been defiled, and did commit a trespass against her husband, that the waters which cause the curse have gone into her for bitter things, and her belly had swelled, and her thigh had fallen, and the woman had become an execration in the middle of her people.
\v 28 And if the woman had not been defiled, and is clean, then she had been acquitted, and had been sown with seed.
\v 29 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife turneth aside under her husband, and had been defiled,
\v 30 or when a spirit of jealousy passeth over a man, and he had been jealous of his wife, then he had caused the woman to stand before Yahweh, and the priest had done to her all this law,
\v 31 and the man had been acquitted from iniquity, and that woman did bear her iniquity.'
\c 6
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When a man or woman doeth singularly, by vowing a vow of a Nazarite, to be separate to Yahweh;
\v 3 from wine and strong drink he did keep separate; vinegar of wine, and vinegar of strong drink he did not drink, and any juice of grapes he did not drink, and grapes moist or dry he did not eat;
\v 4 all days of his separation, of anything which is made of the wine-vine, from kernels even unto husk, he did not eat.
\v 5 'All days of the vow of his separation a razor did not pass over his head; till the fulness of the days which he did separate to Yahweh he is holy; grown up had the upper part of the hair of his head.
\v 6 'All days of his keeping separate to Yahweh, near a dead person he did not go;
\v 7 for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister — he is not unclean for them at their death, for the separation of his God is on his head;
\v 8 all days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.
\v 9 'And when the dead dieth beside him in an instant, suddenly, and he had defiled the head of his separation, then he had shaved his head in the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he did shave it,
\v 10 and on the eighth day he brought in two turtle-doves or two young pigeons unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 11 and the priest had prepared one for a sin-offering, and one for a burnt-offering, and had made atonement for him, because of that which he had sinned by the body, and he had hallowed his head on that day;
\v 12 and he had separated to Yahweh the days of his separation, and he had brought in a lamb, a son of a year, for a guilt-offering, and the former days are fallen, for his separation had been defiled.
\v 13 And this is the law of the Nazarite; in the day of the fulness of the days of his separation did one bring him in unto the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 14 and he had brought near his offering to Yahweh, one he-lamb, a son of a year, a perfect one, for a burnt-offering, and one she-lamb, a daughter of a year, a perfect one, for a sin-offering, and one ram, a perfect one, for peace-offerings,
\v 15 and a basket of unleavened things of flour, cakes mixed with oil, and thin cakes of unleavened things anointed with oil, and their present, and their libations.
\v 16 And the priest had brought them near before Yahweh, and had made his sin-offering and his burnt-offering;
\v 17 and the ram he made a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, besides the basket of unleavened things; and the priest had made its present and its libation.
\v 18 And the Nazarite had shaved (at the opening of the tent of meeting) the head of his separation, and had taken the hair of the head of his separation, and had put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.
\v 19 'And the priest had taken the boiled shoulder from the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one thin unleavened cake, and had put on the palms of the Nazarite after his shaving his separation;
\v 20 and the priest had waved them, a wave-offering before Yahweh; it is holy to the priest, besides the breast of the wave-offering, and besides the leg of the heave-offering; and afterwards did the Nazarite drink wine.
\v 21 This is the law of the Nazarite, who voweth his offering to Yahweh for his separation, apart from that which his hand attaineth; according to his vow which he voweth so he did by the law of his separation.'
\v 22 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 23 'Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, saying, Thus ye do bless the sons of Israel, saying to them,
\v 24 'Yahweh bless thee and keep thee;
\v 25 'Yahweh cause His face to shine upon thee, and favour thee;
\v 26 Yahweh lift up His countenance upon thee, and appoint for thee — peace.
\v 27 And they have put My name upon the sons of Israel, and I — I do bless them.'
\c 7
\v 1 And it came to pass on the day of Moses' finishing setting up the tabernacle, that he anointeth it, and sanctifieth it, and all its vessels, and the altar, and all its vessels, and he anointeth them, and sanctifieth them,
\v 2 and the princes of Israel (heads of the house of their fathers, they are princes of the tribes, they who are standing over those numbered) bring near,
\v 3 yea, they bring their offering before Yahweh, six waggons covered, and twelve oxen — a waggon for two of the princes, and an ox for one — and they bring them near before the tabernacle.
\v 4 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 5 'Receive from them, and they have been to do the service of the tent of meeting, and you hast given them unto the Levites, each according to his service.'
\v 6 And Moses taketh the waggons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
\v 7 The two of the waggons and the four of the oxen he had given to the sons of Gershon, according to their service,
\v 8 and the four of the waggons and the eight of the oxen he had given to the sons of Merari, according to their service, by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest;
\v 9 and to the sons of Kohad he had not given, for the service of the sanctuary is on them: on the shoulder they bear.
\v 10 And the princes bring near the dedication of the altar in the day of its being anointed; yea, the princes bring near their offering before the altar.
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'One prince a day — one prince a day — do they bring near their offering for the dedication of the altar.'
\v 12 And he who is bringing near on the first day his offering is Nahshon son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah.

\v 89 And in the going in of Moses unto the tent of meeting to speak with Him — he did even hear the voice speaking unto him from off the mercy-seat which is upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubs; and He spoke unto him.
\c 8
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto Aaron, and you hast said unto him, In your causing the lights to go up, over-against the face of the candlestick do the seven lights give light.'
\v 3 And Aaron did so; over-against the face of the candlestick he had caused its lights to go up, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 4 And this is the work of the candlestick: beaten work of gold; unto its thigh, unto its flower it is beaten work; as the appearance which Yahweh shewed Moses, so he had made the candlestick.
\v 5 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 6 'Take the Levites from the middle of the sons of Israel, and you hast cleansed them.
\v 7 'And thus you will to them to cleanse them: sprinkle upon them waters of atonement, and they have caused a razor to pass over all their flesh, and have washed their garments, and cleansed themselves,
\v 8 and have taken a bullock, a son of the herd, and its present, flour mixed with oil, — and a second bullock a son of the herd you will take for a sin-offering,
\v 9 and you hast brought near the Levites before the tent of meeting, and you hast assembled the whole company of the sons of Israel,
\v 10 and you hast brought near the Levites before Yahweh, and the sons of Israel have laid their hands on the Levites,
\v 11 and Aaron had waved the Levites — a wave-offering before Yahweh, from the sons of Israel, and they have been — for doing the service of Yahweh.
\v 12 'And the Levites lay their hands on the head of the bullocks, and make you the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering to Yahweh, to atone for the Levites,
\v 13 and you hast caused the Levites to stand before Aaron, and before his sons, and hast waved them — a wave-offering to Yahweh;
\v 14 and you hast separated the Levites from the middle of the sons of Israel, and the Levites have become Mine;
\v 15 and afterwards do the Levites come in to serve the tent of meeting, and you hast cleansed them, and hast waved them — a wave-offering.
\v 16 For they are certainly given to Me out of the middle of the sons of Israel, instead of him who opened any womb — the first-born of all — from the sons of Israel I have taken them to Myself;
\v 17 for Mine is every first-born among the sons of Israel, among man and among beast; in the day of my smiting every first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself;
\v 18 and I take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel:
\v 19 'And I give the Levites gifts to Aaron and to his sons, from the middle of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the sons of Israel, and there is no plague among the sons of Israel in the sons of Israel's drawing nigh unto the sanctuary.'
\v 20 And Moses did — Aaron also, and all the company of the sons of Israel — to the Levites according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites; so have the sons of Israel done to them.
\v 21 And the Levites cleanse themselves, and wash their garments, and Aaron waveth them a wave-offering before Yahweh, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them,
\v 22 and afterwards have the Levites gone in to do their service in the tent of meeting, before Aaron and before his sons; as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they have done to them.
\v 23 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 24 This is that which is the Levites': from a son of five and twenty years and upward he did go in to serve the host in the service of the tent of meeting,
\v 25 and from a son of fifty years he did return from the host of the service, and did not serve any more,
\v 26 and he had ministered with his brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and did not do service; thus you will to the Levites concerning their charge.'
\c 9
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,
\v 2 'Also, the sons of Israel prepare the passover in its appointed season;
\v 3 in the fourteenth day of this month between the evenings ye prepare it in its appointed season; according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances ye prepare it.'
\v 4 And Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel to prepare the passover,
\v 5 and they prepare the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done.
\v 6 And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a man, and they have not been able to prepare the passover on that day, and they come near before Moses, and before Aaron, on that day,
\v 7 and those men say unto him, 'We are defiled by the body of a man; why are we withheld so as not to bring near the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, in the middle of the sons of Israel?'
\v 8 And Moses said unto them, 'Stand ye, and I hear what Yahweh had commanded concerning you.'
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 10 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Though any man is unclean by a body or in a distant journey (of you or of your generations), yet he had prepared a passover to Yahweh;
\v 11 in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the evenings they prepare it; with unleavened and bitter things they eat it;
\v 12 they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they prepare it.
\v 13 'And the man who is clean, and had not been on a journey, and had ceased to prepare the passover, even that person had been cut off from his people; because the offering of Yahweh he had not brought near, in its appointed season, that man did bear his sin.
\v 14 'And when a sojourner sojourneth with you, then he had prepared a passover to Yahweh, according to the statute of the passover, and according to its ordinance, so he did; one statute is to you, even to a sojourner, and to a native of the land.'
\v 15 And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle had the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and in the evening there is on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire till morning;
\v 16 so it is continually; the cloud covereth it, also the appearance of fire by night.
\v 17 And according to the going up of the cloud from off the tent and afterwards do the sons of Israel journey; and in the place where the cloud did tabernacle, there do the sons of Israel encamp;
\v 18 by the command of Yahweh the sons of Israel journey, and by the command of Yahweh they encamp; all the days that the cloud did tabernacle over the tabernacle they encamp.
\v 19 And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many days, then have the sons of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh, and journey not,
\v 20 and so when the cloud is a number of days over the tabernacle; by the command of Yahweh they encamp, and by the command of Yahweh they journey.
\v 21 And so when the cloud is from evening till morning, when the cloud had gone up in the morning, then they have journeyed; whether by day or by night, when the cloud had gone up, then they have journeyed.
\v 22 Whether two days, or a month, or days, in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle, to tabernacle over it, the sons of Israel encamp, and journey not; and in its being lifted up they journey;
\v 23 by the command of Yahweh they encamp, and by the command of Yahweh they journey; the charge of Yahweh they have kept, by the command of Yahweh in the hand of Moses.
\c 10
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Make to thee two trumpets of silver; beaten work you will make them, and they have been to thee for the convocation of the company, and for the journeying of the camps;
\v 3 and they have blown with them, and all the company have met together unto thee, unto the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 4 And if with one they blow, then have the princes, heads of the yousands of Israel, met together unto thee;
\v 5 And ye have blown — a shout, and the camps which are encamping eastward have journeyed.
\v 6 And ye have blown — a second shout, and the camps which are encamping southward have journeyed; a shout they blow for their journeys.
\v 7 'And in the assembling of the assembly ye blow, and do not shout;
\v 8 and sons of Aaron, the priests, blow with the trumpets; and they have been to you for a statute age-during to your generations.
\v 9 'And when ye go into battle in your land against the adversary who is distressing you, then ye have shouted with the trumpets, and ye have been remembered before Yahweh your God, and ye have been saved from your enemies.
\v 10 And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in the beginnings of your months, ye have blown also with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings, and they have been to you for a memorial before your God; I, Yahweh, am your God.'
\v 11 And it came to pass — in the second year, in the second month, in the twentieth of the month — the cloud had gone up from off the tabernacle of the testimony,
\v 12 and the sons of Israel journey in their journeyings from the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud did tabernacle in the wilderness of Paran;
\v 13 and they journey at first, by the command of Yahweh, in the hand of Moses.
\v 14 And the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah journeyeth in the first place, by their hosts, and over its host is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
\v 15 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar is Nathaneel son of Zuar.
\v 16 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun is Eliab son of Helon;
\v 17 And the tabernacle had been taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari have journeyed, bearing the tabernacle.
\v 18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben had journeyed, by their hosts, and over its host is Elizur son of Shedeur.
\v 19 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
\v 20 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad is Eliasaph son of Deuel;
\v 21 And the Kohadites have journeyed, bearing the tabernacle, and the others have raised up the tabernacle until their coming in.
\v 22 And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim had journeyed, by their hosts, and over its host is Elishama son of Ammihud.
\v 23 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh is Gamalial son of Pedahzur.
\v 24 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin is Abidan son of Gideoni.
\v 25 And the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan had journeyed (rearward to all the camps), by their hosts, and over its host is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
\v 26 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher is Pagiel son of Ocran.
\v 27 And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali is Ahira son of Enan.
\v 28 These are journeyings of the sons of Israel by their hosts — and they journey.
\v 29 And Moses said to Hobab son of Raguel the Midianite, father-in-law of Moses, 'We are journeying unto the place of which Yahweh had said, I give it to you; go with us, and we have done good to thee; for Yahweh had spoken good concerning Israel.'
\v 30 And he said unto him, 'I do not go; but unto my land and unto my kindred do I go.'
\v 31 And he said, 'I pray thee, forsake us not, because you hast known our encamping in the wilderness, and you hast been to us for eyes;
\v 32 and it had come to pass when you goest with us, yea, it had come to pass — that good which Yahweh did kindly with us — it we have done kindly to thee.'
\v 33 And they journey from the mount of Yahweh a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is journeying before them the journey of three days, to spy out for them a resting-place;
\v 34 and the cloud of Yahweh is on them by day, in their journeying from the camp.
\v 35 And it came to pass in the journeying of the ark, that Moses said, 'Rise, O Yahweh, and Thine enemies are scattered, and those hating Thee flee from Your presence.'
\v 36 And in its resting he said, 'Return, O Yahweh, to the myriads, the yousands of Israel.'
\c 11
\v 1 And the people is evil, as those sighing habitually in the ears of Yahweh, and Yahweh heareth, and His anger burneth, and the fire of Yahweh burneth among them, and consumeth in the extremity of the camp.
\v 2 And the people cry unto Moses, and Moses prayeth unto Yahweh, and the fire is quenched;
\v 3 and he called the name of that place Taberah, for the fire of Yahweh had 'burned' among them.
\v 4 And the rabble who are in its middle have lusted greatly, and the sons of Israel also turn back and weep, and say, 'Who did give us flesh?
\v 5 We have remembered the fish which we do eat in Egypt for nought, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick;
\v 6 and now our soul is dry, there is not anything, save the manna, before our eyes.'
\v 7 And the manna is as coriander seed, and its aspect as the aspect of bdolach;
\v 8 the people have turned aside and gathered it, and ground it with millstones, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pan, and made it cakes, and its taste had been as the taste of the moisture of oil.
\v 9 And in the descending of the dew on the camp by night, the manna descendeth upon it.
\v 10 And Moses heareth the people weeping by its families, each at the opening of his tent, and the anger of Yahweh burneth exceedingly, and in the eyes of Moses it is evil.
\v 11 And Moses said unto Yahweh, 'Why hast Thou done evil to Your servant? and why have I not found grace in Thine eyes — to put the burden of all this people upon me?
\v 12 I — have I conceived all this people? I — have I begotten it, that Thou sayest unto me, Carry it in your bosom as the nursing father beareth the suckling, unto the ground which Thou hast sworn to its fathers?
\v 13 Whence have I flesh to give to all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give to us flesh, and we eat.
\v 14 I am not able — I alone — to bear all this people, for it is too heavy for me;
\v 15 and if thus Thou art doing to me — slay me, I pray Thee; slay, if I have found grace in yours eyes, and let me not look on mine affliction.'
\v 16 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you hast known that they are elders of the people, and its authorities; and you hast taken them unto the tent of meeting, and they have stationed themselves there with thee,
\v 17 and I have come down and spoken with thee there, and have kept back of the Spirit which is upon thee, and have put on them, and they have borne with thee some of the burden of the people, and you will not bear it yourself alone.
\v 18 And unto the people you will say, Sanctify yourselves for to-morrow, and ye have eaten flesh (for ye have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, Who did give us flesh? for we had good in Egypt) — and Yahweh had given to you flesh, and ye have eaten.
\v 19 Ye do not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days; — 
\v 20 unto a month of days, till that it come out from your nostrils, and it had become to you an abomination; because that ye have loathed Yahweh, who is in your middle, and weep before Him, saying, Why is this? — we have come out of Egypt!'
\v 21 And Moses said, 'Six hundred yousand footmen are the people in whose middle I am; and Thou, Thou hast said, Flesh I give to them, and they have eaten, a month of days!
\v 22 Is flock and herd slaughtered for them, that one had found for them? — are all the fishes of the sea gathered for them — that one had found for them?'
\v 23 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Is the hand of Yahweh become short? now you will see whether My word meeteth thee or not.'
\v 24 And Moses went out, and spoke unto the people the words of Yahweh, and gathereth seventy men of the elders of the people, and caused them to stand round about the tent,
\v 25 and Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and keepeth back of the Spirit which is on him, and putteth on the seventy men of the elders; and it came to pass at the resting of the Spirit on them, that they prophesy, and do not cease.
\v 26 And two of the men are left in the camp, the name of the one is Eldad, and the name of the second Medad, and the spirit rested upon them, (and they are among those written, and have not gone out to the tent), and they prophesy in the camp;
\v 27 and the young man runneth, and declareth to Moses, and said, 'Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.'
\v 28 And Joshua son of Nun, minister of Moses, one of his young men, answereth and said, 'My lord Moses, restrain them.'
\v 29 And Moses said to him, 'Art you zealous for me? O that all Yahweh's people were prophets! that Yahweh would put His Spirit upon them!'
\v 30 And Moses is gathered unto the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\v 31 And a spirit had journeyed from Yahweh, and cutteth off quails from the sea, and leaveth by the camp, as a day's journey here, and as a day's journey there, round about the camp, and about two cubits, on the face of the land.
\v 32 And the people rise all that day, and all the night, and all the day after, and gather the quails — he who had least had gathered ten homers — and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp.
\v 33 The flesh is yet between their teeth — it is not yet cut off — and the anger of Yahweh had burned among the people, and Yahweh smiteth among the people — a very great smiting;
\v 34 and one called the name of that place Kibroth-Hattaavah, for there they have buried the people who lust.
\v 35 From Kibroth-Hattaavah have the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they are in Hazeroth.
\c 12
\v 1 And Miriam spoke — Aaron also — against Moses concerning the circumstance of the Cushite woman whom he had taken: for a Cushite woman he had taken;
\v 2 and they say, 'Only by Moses had Yahweh spoken? also by us had he not spoken?' and Yahweh heareth.
\v 3 And the man Moses is very humble, more than any of the men who are on the face of the ground.
\v 4 And Yahweh said suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, 'Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting;' and they three come out.
\v 5 And Yahweh came down in the pillar of the cloud, and standeth at the opening of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam, and they come out both of them.
\v 6 And He said, 'Hear, I pray you, My words: If your prophet is of Yahweh — in an appearance unto him I make Myself known; in a dream I speak with him;
\v 7 not so My servant Moses; in all My house he is stedfast;
\v 8 mouth unto mouth I speak with him, and by an appearance, and not in riddles; and the form of Yahweh he beholdeth attentively; and wherefore have ye not been afraid to speak against My servant — against Moses?'
\v 9 And the anger of Yahweh burneth against them, and He went on,
\v 10 and the cloud had turned aside from off the tent, and lo, Miriam is leprous as snow; and Aaron turneth unto Miriam, and lo, leprous!
\v 11 And Aaron said unto Moses, 'O, my lord, I pray thee, lay not upon us sin in which we have been foolish, and in which we have sinned;
\v 12 let her not, I pray thee, be as one dead, when in his coming out from the womb of his mother — the half of his flesh is consumed.'
\v 13 And Moses crieth unto Yahweh, saying, 'O God, I pray Thee, give, I pray Thee, healing to her.'
\v 14 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'And her father had but spat in her face — is she not ashamed seven days? she is shut out seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterwards she is gathered.'
\v 15 And Miriam is shut out at the outside of the camp seven days, and the people had not journeyed till Miriam is gathered;
\v 16 and afterwards have the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and they encamp in the wilderness of Paran.
\c 13
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Send for thee men, and they spy the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel; one man, one man for the tribe of his fathers ye do send, every one a prince among them.'
\v 3 And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran by the command of Yahweh; all of them are men, heads of the sons of Israel they are,
\v 4 and these their names: For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur.
\v 5 For the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori.
\v 6 For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh.
\v 7 For the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph.
\v 8 For the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea, son of Nun.
\v 9 For the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu.
\v 10 For the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi.
\v 11 For the tribe of Joseph, (for the tribe of Manasseh,) Gaddi son of Susi.
\v 12 For the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli.
\v 13 For the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael.
\v 14 For the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vopshi.
\v 15 For the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi.
\v 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses had sent to spy the land; and Moses called Hoshea son of Nun, Jehoshua.
\v 17 And Moses sent them to spy the land of Canaan, and said unto them, 'Go ye up this way into the south, and ye have gone up the mountain,
\v 18 and have seen the land what it is, and the people which is dwelling on it, whether it is strong or feeble; whether it is few or many;
\v 19 and what the land is in which it is dwelling, whether it is good or bad; and what are the cities in which it is dwelling, whether in camps or in fortresses;
\v 20 And what the land is, whether it is fat or lean; whether there is wood in it or not; and ye have strengthened yourselves, and have taken of the fruit of the land;' and the days are days of the first-fruits of grapes.
\v 21 And they go up and spy the land, from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob at the going in to Hamath;
\v 22 and they go up by the south, and come in unto Hebron, and there are Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak (and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt),
\v 23 and they come in unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down there a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they bear it on a staff by two, also some of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\v 24 That place had one called Brook of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut from there.
\v 25 And they turn back from spying the land at the end of forty days.
\v 26 And they go and come in unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they bring them and all the company back word, and shew them the fruit of the land.
\v 27 And they recount to him, and say, 'We came in unto the land whither you hast sent us, and also it is flowing with milk and honey — and this is its fruit;
\v 28 only, surely the people which is dwelling in the land is strong; and the cities are fenced, very great; and also children of Anak we have seen there.
\v 29 Amalek is dwelling in the land of the south, and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite is dwelling in the hill country, and the Canaanite is dwelling by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.'
\v 30 And Caleb stilleth the people concerning Moses, and said, 'Let us certainly go up — and we have possessed it; for we are thoroughly able for it.'
\v 31 And the men who have gone up with him said, 'We are not able to go up against the people, for it is stronger than we;'
\v 32 and they bring out an evil account of the land which they have spied unto the sons of Israel, saying, 'The land into which we passed over to spy it, is a land eating up its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in its middle are men of stature;
\v 33 and there we saw the Nephilim, sons of Anak, of the Nephilim; and we are in our own eyes as grasshoppers; and so we were in their eyes.'
\c 14
\v 1 And all the company lifteth up and give forth their voice, and the people weep during that night;
\v 2 and all the sons of Israel murmur against Moses, and against Aaron, and all the company say unto them, 'O that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness, O that we had died!
\v 3 and why is Yahweh bringing us in unto this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our infants are become a prey; is it not good for us to turn back to Egypt?'
\v 4 And they say one unto another, 'Let us appoint a head, and turn back to Egypt.'
\v 5 And Moses falleth — Aaron also — on their faces, before all the assembly of the company of the sons of Israel.
\v 6 And Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, of those spying the land, have rent their garments,
\v 7 and they speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, 'The land into which we have passed over to spy it, is a very very good land;
\v 8 if Yahweh had delighted in us, then He had brought us in unto this land, and had given it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey;
\v 9 only, against Yahweh rebel not ye: and ye, fear not ye the people of the land, for our bread they are; their defence had turned aside from off them, and Yahweh is with us; fear them not.'
\v 10 And all the company say to stone them with stones, and the honour of Yahweh had appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the sons of Israel.
\v 11 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Until when did this people despise Me? and until when do they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have done in its middle?
\v 12 I smite it with pestilence, and dispossess it, and make thee become a nation greater and mightier than it.'
\v 13 And Moses said unto Yahweh, 'Then have the Egyptians heard! for Thou hast brought up with Your power this people out of their middle,
\v 14 and they have said it unto the inhabitant of this land, they have heard that Thou, Yahweh, art in the middle of this people, that eye to eye Thou art seen — O Yahweh, and Your cloud is standing over them, — and in a pillar of cloud Thou art going before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\v 15 'And Thou hast put to death this people as one man, and the nations who have heard Your fame have spoken, saying,
\v 16 From Yahweh's want of ability to bring in this people unto the land which He had sworn to them — He did slaughter them in the wilderness.
\v 17 'And now, let, I pray Thee, the power of my Lord be great, as Thou hast spoken, saying:
\v 18 Yahweh is slow to anger, and of great kindness; bearing away iniquity and transgression, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on a third generation, and on a fourth; — 
\v 19 forgive, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of Your kindness, and as Thou hast borne with this people from Egypt, even until now.'
\v 20 And Yahweh said, 'I have forgiven, according to your word;
\v 21 and yet, I live — and it is filled — the whole earth — with the honour of Yahweh;
\v 22 for all the men who are seeing My honour, and My signs, which I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and try Me these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice — 
\v 23 they see not the land which I have sworn to their fathers, yea, none of those despising Me see it;
\v 24 and My servant Caleb, because there had been another spirit with him, and he is fully after Me — I have brought him in unto the land whither he had entered, and his seed did possess it.
\v 25 And the Amalekite and the Canaanite are dwelling in the valley; to-morrow turn ye and journey for yourselves into the wilderness — the way of the Red Sea.'
\v 26 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 27 'Until when had this evil company that which they are murmuring against Me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against Me, I have heard;
\v 28 say unto them, I live — an affirmation of Yahweh — if, as ye have spoken in Mine ears — so I do not to you;
\v 29 in this wilderness do your carcases fall, even all your numbered ones, to all your number, from a son of twenty years and upward, who have murmured against Me;
\v 30 ye — ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it, except Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun.
\v 31 As to your infants — of whom ye have said, A spoil they are become — I have even brought them in, and they have known the land which ye have kicked against;
\v 32 as to you — your carcases do fall in this wilderness,
\v 33 and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years, and have borne your whoredoms till your carcases are consumed in the wilderness;
\v 34 by the number of the days in which ye spied the land, forty days, — a day for a year, a day for a year — ye do bear your iniquities, forty years, and ye have known my breaking off;
\v 35 I am Yahweh, I have spoken; if I do not this to all this evil company who are meeting against me; — in this wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.'
\v 36 And the men whom Moses had sent to spy the land, and they turn back and cause all the company to murmur against him, by bringing out an evil account concerning the land,
\v 37 even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die by the plague before Yahweh;
\v 38 and Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, have lived of those men who go to spy out the land.
\v 39 And Moses spoke these words unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourn exceedingly,
\v 40 and they rise early in the morning, and go up unto the top of the mountain, saying, 'Here we are, and we have come up unto the place which Yahweh had spoken of, for we have sinned.'
\v 41 And Moses said, 'Why is this? — ye are transgressing the command of Yahweh, and it did not prosper;
\v 42 go not up, for Yahweh is not in your middle, and ye are not smitten before your enemies;
\v 43 for the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there before you, and ye have fallen by the sword, because that ye have turned back from after Yahweh, and Yahweh is not with you.'
\v 44 And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and Moses have not departed out of the middle of the camp.
\v 45 And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in that mountain come down and smite them, and beat them down — unto Hormah.
\c 15
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,
\v 3 then ye have prepared a fire-offering to Yahweh, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or free-will-offering, or in your appointed things, to make a sweet fragrance to Yahweh, out of the herd, or out of the flock.
\v 4 'And he who is bringing near his offering to Yahweh had brought near a present of flour, a tenth deal, mixed with a fourth of the hin of oil;
\v 5 and wine for a libation, a fourth of the hin you will prepare for the burnt-offering or for a sacrifice, for the one lamb;
\v 6 or for a ram you will prepare a present of flour, two-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a third of the hin;
\v 7 and wine for a libation, a third part of the hin, you will bring near — a sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 8 'And when you makest a son of the herd a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or peace-offerings to Yahweh,
\v 9 then he had brought near for the son of the herd a present of flour, three-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a half of the hin;
\v 10 and wine you bringest near for a libation, a half of the hin — a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh;
\v 11 thus it is done for the one ox, or for the one ram, or for a lamb of the sheep or of the goats.
\v 12 'According to the number that ye prepare, so ye do to each, according to their number;
\v 13 every native did thus with these, at bringing near a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh;
\v 14 and when a sojourner sojourneth with you, or whoso is in your middle to your generations, and he had made a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh, as ye do so he did.
\v 15 One statute is for you of the congregation and for the sojourner who is sojourning, a statute age-during to your generations: as ye are so is the sojourner before Yahweh;
\v 16 one law and one ordinance is to you and to the sojourner who is sojourning with you.'
\v 17 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 18 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, In your coming in unto the land whither I am bringing you in,
\v 19 then it had been, in your eating of the bread of the land, ye heave up a heave-offering to Yahweh;
\v 20 the beginning of your dough a cake ye heave up — a heave-offering; as the heave-offering of a threshing-floor, so ye do heave it.
\v 21 Of the beginning of your dough ye do give to Yahweh a heave-offering — to your generations.
\v 22 'And when ye err, and do not all these commands which Yahweh had spoken unto Moses,
\v 23 the whole that Yahweh had charged upon you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Yahweh had commanded, and henceforth, to your generations,
\v 24 then it had been, if from the eyes of the company it had been done in ignorance, that all the company have prepared one bullock, a son of the herd, for a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance to Yahweh, and its present, and its libation, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.
\v 25 And the priest had made atonement for all the company of the sons of Israel, and it had been forgiven them, for it is ignorance, and they — they have brought in their offering, a fire-offering to Yahweh, even their sin-offering before Yahweh for their ignorance;
\v 26 and it had been forgiven to all the company of the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their middle; for to all the company it is done in ignorance.
\v 27 'And if one person sin in ignorance, then he had brought near a she-goat, daughter of a year, for a sin-offering;
\v 28 and the priest had made atonement for the person who is erring, in his sinning in ignorance before Yahweh, by making atonement for him, and it had been forgiven him;
\v 29 for the native among the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner who is sojourning in their middle — one law is to you, for him who is doing anything through ignorance.
\v 30 And the person who did aught with a high hand — of the native or of the sojourner — Yahweh he is reviling, and that person had been cut off from the middle of his people;
\v 31 because the word of Yahweh he despised, and His command had broken — that person is certainly cut off; his iniquity is on him.'
\v 32 And the sons of Israel are in the wilderness, and they find a man gathering wood on the sabbath-day,
\v 33 and those finding him gathering wood bring him near unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company,
\v 34 and they place him in ward, for it is not explained what is to be done to him.
\v 35 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'The man is certainly put to death, all the company stoning him with stones, at the outside of the camp.'
\v 36 And all the company bring him out unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones, and he dieth, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 37 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 38 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, and they have made for themselves fringes on the skirts of their garments, to their generations, and they have put on the fringe of the skirt a ribbon of blue,
\v 39 and it had been to you for a fringe, and ye have seen it, and have remembered all the commands of Yahweh, and have done them, and ye search not after your heart, and after your eyes, after which ye are going a-whoring;
\v 40 so that ye remember and have done all My commands, and ye have been holy to your God;
\v 41 I am Yahweh your God, who had brought you out from the land of Egypt to become your God; I, Yahweh, am your God.'
\c 16
\v 1 And Korah, son of Izhar, son of Kohad, son of Levi, taketh both Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben,
\v 2 and they rise up before Moses, with men of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty, princes of the company, called of the convention, men of name,
\v 3 and they are assembled against Moses and against Aaron, and say unto them, 'Enough of you! for all the company — all of them are holy, and in their middle is Yahweh; and wherefore do ye lift yourselves up above the assembly of Yahweh?'
\v 4 And Moses heareth, and falleth on his face,
\v 5 and he spoke unto Korah, and unto all his company, saying, 'Morning! — and Yahweh is knowing those who are his, and him who is holy, and had brought near unto Him; even him whom He did fix on He brought near unto Him.
\v 6 This do: take to yourselves censers, Korah, and all his company,
\v 7 and put in them fire, and put on them perfume, before Yahweh to-morrow, and it had been, the man whom Yahweh chooseth, he is the holy one; — enough of you, sons of Levi.'
\v 8 And Moses said unto Korah, 'Hear ye, I pray you, sons of Levi;
\v 9 is it little to you that the God of Israel had separated you from the company of Israel to bring you near unto Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Yahweh, and to stand before the company to serve them? — 
\v 10 yea, He did bring thee near, and all your brethren the sons of Levi with thee — and ye have sought also the priesthood!
\v 11 Therefore, you and all your company who are met are against Yahweh; and Aaron, what is he, that ye murmur against him?'
\v 12 And Moses sent to call for Dathan and for Abiram sons of Eliab, and they say, 'We do not come up;
\v 13 is it little that you hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in a wilderness that you also certainly makest yourself prince over us?
\v 14 Yea, unto a land flowing with milk and honey you hast not brought us in, nor will you give to us an inheritance of field and vineyard; the eyes of these men will you pick out? we do not come up.'
\v 15 And it is very displeasing to Moses, and he said unto Yahweh, 'Turn not Thou unto their present; not one ass from them have I taken, nor have I afflicted one of them.'
\v 16 And Moses said unto Korah, 'Thou and all your company, be ye before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow;
\v 17 and take ye each his censer, and ye have put on them perfume, and brought near before Yahweh, each his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; and you and Aaron, each his censer.'
\v 18 And they take each his censer, and put on them fire, and lay on them perfume, and they stand at the opening of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.
\v 19 And Korah assembleth against them all the company unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the honour of Yahweh is seen by all the company.
\v 20 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 21 'Be ye separated from the middle of this company, and I consume them in a moment;'
\v 22 and they fall on their faces, and say, 'God, God of the spirits of all flesh — the one man sinneth, and against all the company Thou art wroth!'
\v 23 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 24 'Speak unto the company, saying, Go ye up from round about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'
\v 25 And Moses riseth, and went unto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel go after him,
\v 26 and he spoke unto the company, saying, 'Turn aside, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and come not against anything that they have, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.'
\v 27 And they go up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, from round about, and Dathan, and Abiram have come out, standing at the opening of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their infants.
\v 28 And Moses said, 'By this ye do know that Yahweh had sent me to do all these works, that they are not from my own heart;
\v 29 if according to the death of all men these die — or the charge of all men is charged upon them — Yahweh had not sent me;
\v 30 and if a strange thing Yahweh do, and the ground had opened her mouth and swallowed them, and all that they have, and they have gone down alive to Sheol — then ye have known that these men have despised Yahweh.'
\v 31 And it came to pass at his finishing speaking all these words, that the ground which is under them cleaveth,
\v 32 and the earth opened her mouth, and swalloweth them, and their houses, and all the men who are for Korah, and all the goods,
\v 33 and they go down, they, and all that they have, alive to Sheol, and the earth closeth over them, and they perish from the middle of the assembly;
\v 34 and all Israel who are round about them have fled at their voice, for they said, 'Lest the earth swallow us;'
\v 35 and fire had come out from Yahweh, and consumeth the two hundred and fifty men bringing near the perfume.
\v 36 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 37 'Say unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, and he lifteth up the censers from the middle of the burning, and the fire scatter you yonder, for they have been hallowed,
\v 38 even the censers of these sinners against their own souls; and they have made them spread-out plates, a covering for the altar, for they have brought them near before Yahweh, and they are hallowed; and they are become a sign to the sons of Israel.'
\v 39 And Eleazar the priest taketh the brazen censers which they who are burnt had brought near, and they spread them out, a covering for the altar — 
\v 40 a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that a stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron did not draw near to make a perfume before Yahweh, and is not as Korah, and as his company, — as Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Moses to him.
\v 41 And all the company of the sons of Israel murmur, on the morrow, against Moses and against Aaron, saying, 'Ye — ye have put to death the people of Yahweh.'
\v 42 And it came to pass, in the company being assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they turn towards the tent of meeting, and lo, the cloud had covered it, and the honour of Yahweh is seen;
\v 43 and Moses came — Aaron also — unto the front of the tent of meeting.
\v 44 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 45 'Get you up from the middle of this company, and I consume them in a moment;' and they fall on their faces,
\v 46 and Moses said unto Aaron, 'Take the censer, and put on it fire from off the altar, and place perfume, and go, hasten unto the company, and make atonement for them, for the wrath had gone out from the presence of Yahweh — the plague had begun.'
\v 47 And Aaron taketh as Moses had spoken, and runneth unto the middle of the assembly, and lo, the plague had begun among the people; and he gave the perfume, and made atonement for the people,
\v 48 and standeth between the dead and the living, and the plague is restrained;
\v 49 and those who die by the plague are fourteen yousand and seven hundred, apart from those who die for the matter of Korah;
\v 50 and Aaron turneth back unto Moses, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and the plague had been restrained.
\c 17
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and take from them each a rod, for a father's house, from all their princes, for the house of their fathers, twelve rods; the name of each you will write on his rod,
\v 3 and Aaron's name you will write on the tribe of Levi; for one rod is for the head of their fathers' house:
\v 4 and you hast placed them in the tent of meeting, before the testimony, where I meet with you.
\v 5 'And it had come to pass, the man's rod on whom I fix did flourish, and I have caused to cease from off me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you.'
\v 6 And Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel, and all their princes give unto him one rod for a prince, one rod for a prince, for their fathers' house, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron is in the middle of their rods;
\v 7 and Moses placeth the rods before Yahweh, in the tent of the testimony.
\v 8 And it came to pass, on the morrow, that Moses went in unto the tent of the testimony, and lo, the rod of Aaron had flourished for the house of Levi, and is bringing out flourishing, and did blossom blossoms, and did produce almonds;
\v 9 and Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh, unto all the sons of Israel, and they look, and take each his rod.
\v 10 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, for a charge, for a sign to the sons of rebellion, and you will remove their murmurings from off me, and they do not die;'
\v 11 and Moses did as Yahweh had commanded him; so he had done.
\v 12 And the sons of Israel speak unto Moses, saying, 'Lo, we have expired; we have perished; we have all of us perished;
\v 13 any who is at all drawing near unto the tabernacle of Yahweh dieth; have we not been consumed — to expire?'
\c 18
\v 1 And Yahweh said unto Aaron, 'Thou, and your sons, and the house of your father with thee, do bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you, and your sons with thee, do bear the iniquity of your priesthood;
\v 2 and also your brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with thee, and they are joined unto thee, and serve thee, even you and your sons with thee, before the tent of the testimony.
\v 3 'And they have kept your charge, and the charge of all the tent; only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar they do not come near, and they die not, either they or you;
\v 4 and they have been joined unto thee, and have kept the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and a stranger did not come near unto you;
\v 5 and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, and there is no more wrath against the sons of Israel.
\v 6 'And I, lo, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the middle of the sons of Israel; to you a gift they are given by Yahweh, to do the service of the tent of meeting;
\v 7 and you, and your sons with thee, do keep your priesthood, for everything of the altar, and within the vail, and ye have served; a service of gift I make your priesthood; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke unto Aaron: 'And I, lo, I have given to thee the charge of My heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel — to thee I have given them for the anointing, and to your sons, by a statute age-during.
\v 9 This is yours of the most holy things, from the fire: all their offering, to all their present, and to all their sin-offering, and to all their guilt-offering, which they give back to Me, is most holy to thee, and to your sons;
\v 10 in the holy of holies you will eat it; every male did eat it; holy it is to thee.
\v 11 And this is yours: the heave-offering of their gift, to all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel, to thee I have given them, and to your sons, and to your daughters with thee, by a statute age-during; every clean one in your house did eat it;
\v 12 all the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and wheat — their first -fruits which they give to Yahweh — to thee I have given them.
\v 13 The first-fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring in to Yahweh, are yours; every clean one in your house did eat it;
\v 14 every devoted thing in Israel is yours,
\v 15 every one opening a womb of all flesh which they bring near to Yahweh, among man and among beast, is yours; only, you will certainly ransom the first-born of man, and the firstling of the unclean beast you will ransom.
\v 16 And their ransomed ones from a son of a month, you will ransom with your valuation, of silver, five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs it is.
\v 17 Only, the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you will not ransom, holy they are: their blood you will sprinkle on the altar, and of their fat you makest perfume, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Yahweh,
\v 18 and their flesh is yours, as the breast of the wave-offering, and as the right leg, it is yours;
\v 19 all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel lift up to Yahweh I have given to thee and to your sons, and to your daughters with thee, by a statute age-during, a covenant of salt, age-during it is before Yahweh, to thee and to your seed with thee.'
\v 20 And Yahweh said unto Aaron, 'In their land you will not inherit, and a portion you hast not in their middle: I am your portion, and yours inheritance in the middle of the sons of Israel;
\v 21 and to the sons of Levi, lo, I have given all the tenth in Israel for inheritance in exchange for their service which they are serving — the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 22 'And the sons of Israel come no more near unto the tent of meeting, to bear sin, to die,
\v 23 and the Levites have done the service of the tent of meeting, and they — they bear their iniquity; a statute age-during to your generations, that in the middle of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance;
\v 24 but the tithe of the sons of Israel which they lift up to Yahweh, a heave-offering, I have given to the Levites for inheritance; therefore I have said of them, In the middle of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance.'
\v 25 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 26 'And unto the Levites you will speak; and you hast said unto them, When ye take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given to you from them, for your inheritance, then ye have lifted up from it the heave-offering of Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe;
\v 27 and your heave-offering had been reckoned to you as corn from the threshing-floor, and as fulness from the wine-vat;
\v 28 so ye do lift up — ye also — the heave-offering of Yahweh from all your tithes which ye receive from the sons of Israel; and ye have given from it the heave-offering of Yahweh to Aaron the priest;
\v 29 out of all your gifts ye do lift up the whole heave-offering of Yahweh; out of all its fat, — its hallowed part — out of it.
\v 30 'And you hast said unto them, In your lifting up its fat out of it, then it had been reckoned to the Levites, as increase of a threshing-floor, and as increase of a wine-vat;
\v 31 and ye have eaten it in every place, ye and your households, for it is your hire in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting;
\v 32 and ye bear no sin for it, in your lifting up its fat out of it, and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye do not pollute, and ye die not.'
\c 19
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 2 This is a statute of the law which Yahweh had commanded, saying, Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee a red cow, a perfect one, in which there is no blemish, on which no yoke had gone up;
\v 3 and ye have given it unto Eleazar the priest, and he had brought it out unto the outside of the camp, and had slaughtered it before him.
\v 4 'And Eleazar the priest had taken of its blood with his finger, and had sprinkled over-against the front of the tent of meeting of her blood seven times;
\v 5 and one had burnt the cow before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, besides her dung, he did burn;
\v 6 and the priest had taken cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and had cast unto the middle of the burning of the cow;
\v 7 and the priest had washed his garments, and had bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards did come in unto the camp, and the priest is unclean till the evening;
\v 8 and he who is burning it did wash his garments with water, and had bathed his flesh with water, and is unclean till the evening.
\v 9 And a clean man had gathered the ashes of the cow, and had placed at the outside of the camp, in a clean place, and it had become to the company of the sons of Israel a charge for waters of separation — it is a cleansing;
\v 10 and he who is gathering the ashes of the heifer had washed his garments, and is unclean till the evening; and it had been to the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their middle, for a statute age-during.
\v 11 He who is coming against the dead body of any man — is unclean seven days;
\v 12 he did cleanse himself for it on the third day, and on the seventh day he is clean; and if he cleanse not himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he is not clean.
\v 13 Any one who is coming against the dead, against the body of man who dieth, and cleanseth not himself — the tabernacle of Yahweh he had defiled, and that person had been cut off from Israel, for water of separation is not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean; his uncleanness is still upon him.
\v 14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: every one who is coming in unto the tent, and all that is in the tent, is unclean seven days;
\v 15 and every open vessel which had no covering of thread upon it is unclean.
\v 16 'And every one who came, on the face of the field, against the pierced of a sword, or against the dead, or against a bone of man, or against a grave, is unclean seven days;
\v 17 and they have taken for the unclean person of the ashes of the burning of the cleansing, and he had put upon it running water unto a vessel;
\v 18 and a clean person had taken hyssop, and had dipped it in water, and had sprinkled on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who have been there, and on him who is coming against a bone, or against one pierced, or against the dead, or against a grave.
\v 19 And the clean had sprinkled it on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day, and had cleansed him on the seventh day, and he had washed his garments, and had bathed with water, and had been clean in the evening.
\v 20 And the man who is unclean, and did not cleanse himself, even that person had been cut off from the middle of the assembly; for the sanctuary of Yahweh he had defiled; water of separation is not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
\v 21 'And it had been to them for a statute age-during, that he who is sprinkling the water of separation did wash his garments, and he who is coming against the water of separation is unclean till the evening,
\v 22 and all against which the unclean person came is unclean, and the person who is coming against it is unclean till the evening.'
\c 20
\v 1 And the sons of Israel come in, — all the company — to the wilderness of Zin, in the first month, and the people abide in Kadesh, and Miriam dieth there, and is buried there.
\v 2 And there had been no water for the company, and they are assembled against Moses, and against Aaron,
\v 3 and the people strive with Moses, and speak, saying, 'And oh that we had expired when our brethren expired before Yahweh!
\v 4 and why have ye brought in the assembly of Yahweh unto this wilderness to die there, we and our beasts?
\v 5 and why hast you brought us up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place? no place of seed, and fig, and vine, and pomegranate; and water there is none to drink.
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron go in from the presence of the assembly unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and fall on their faces, and the honour of Yahweh is seen by them.
\v 7 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 8 'Take the rod, and assemble the company, you and Aaron your brother; and ye have spoken unto the rock before their eyes, and it had given its water, and you hast brought out to them water from the rock, and hast watered the company, and their beasts.'
\v 9 And Moses taketh the rod from before Yahweh, as He had commanded him,
\v 10 and Moses and Aaron assemble the assembly unto the front of the rock, and he said to them, 'Hear, I pray you, O rebels, from this rock do we bring out to you water?'
\v 11 and Moses lifteth up his hand, and smiteth the rock with his rod twice; and much water came out, and the company drink, also their beasts.
\v 12 And Yahweh said unto Moses, and unto Aaron, 'Because ye have not believed in Me to sanctify Me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye do not bring in this assembly unto the land which I have given to them.'
\v 13 These are waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel have 'striven' with Yahweh, and He is sanctified upon them.
\v 14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, 'Thus said your brother Israel, Thou — you hast known all the travail which had found us;
\v 15 that our fathers go down to Egypt, and we dwell in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians do evil to us and to our fathers;
\v 16 and we cry unto Yahweh, and He heareth our voice, and sent a messenger, and is bringing us out of Egypt; and lo, we are in Kadesh, a city in the extremity of your border.
\v 17 Let us pass over, we pray thee, through your land; we pass not over through a field, or through a vineyard, nor do we drink waters of a well; the way of the king we go, we turn not aside — right or left — till that we pass over your border.'
\v 18 And Edom said unto him, 'Thou will not pass over through me, lest with sword I come out to meet thee.'
\v 19 And the sons of Israel say unto him, 'In the highway we go, and if of your waters we drink — I and my cattle — then I have given their price; only (it is nothing) on my feet I pass over.'
\v 20 And he said, 'Thou will not pass over;' and Edom came out to meet him with much people, and with a strong hand;
\v 21 and Edom refuseth to suffer Israel to pass over through his border, and Israel turneth aside from off him.
\v 22 And the sons of Israel, the whole company, journey from Kadesh, and come in unto mount Hor,
\v 23 and Yahweh spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron in mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,
\v 24 'Aaron is gathered unto his people, for he did not go in unto the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because that ye provoked My mouth at the waters of Meribah.
\v 25 'Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and cause them to go up mount Hor,
\v 26 and strip Aaron of his garments, and you hast clothed with them Eleazar his son, and Aaron is gathered, and did die there.'
\v 27 And Moses did as Yahweh had commanded, and they go up unto mount Hor before the eyes of all the company,
\v 28 and Moses strippeth Aaron of his garments, and clotheth with them Eleazar his son, and Aaron dieth there on the top of the mount; and Moses came down — Eleazar also — from the mount,
\v 29 and all the company see that Aaron had expired, and they bewail Aaron thirty days — all the house of Israel.
\c 21
\v 1 And the Canaanite — king Arad — dwelling in the south, heareth that Israel had come the way of the Atharim, and he fighteth against Israel, and taketh some of them captive.
\v 2 And Israel voweth a vow to Yahweh, and said, 'If Thou will certainly give this people into my hand, then I have devoted their cities;'
\v 3 and Yahweh hearkeneth to the voice of Israel, and gave up the Canaanite, and he devoteth them and their cities, and called the name of the place Hormah.
\v 4 And they journey from mount Hor, the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom, and the soul of the people is short in the way,
\v 5 and the people speak against God, and against Moses, 'Why hast you brought us up out of Egypt to die in a wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water, and our soul had been weary of this light bread.'
\v 6 And Yahweh sent among the people the burning serpents, and they bite the people, and much people of Israel die;
\v 7 and the people come in unto Moses and say, 'We have sinned, for we have spoken against Yahweh, and against thee; pray unto Yahweh, and He did turn aside from us the serpent;' and Moses prayeth in behalf of the people.
\v 8 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Make for thee a burning serpent, and set it on an ensign; and it had been, every one who is bitten and had seen it — he had lived.
\v 9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and setteth it on the ensign, and it had been, if the serpent had bitten any man, and he had looked expectingly unto the serpent of brass — he had lived.
\v 10 And the sons of Israel journey, and encamp in Oboth.
\v 11 And they journey from Oboth, and encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the wilderness that is on the front of Moab, at the rising of the sun.
\v 12 From there they have journeyed, and encamp in the valley of Zared.
\v 13 From there they have journeyed, and encamp beyond Arnon, which is in the wilderness which is coming out of the border of the Amorite, for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorite;
\v 14 therefore it is said in a book, 'The wars of Yahweh,' — 'Waheb in Suphah, And the brooks of Arnon;
\v 15 And the spring of the brooks, Which turned aside to the dwelling of Ar, And had leaned to the border of Moab.'
\v 16 And from there they journeyed to Beer; it is the well concerning which Yahweh said to Moses, 'Gather the people, and I give to them — water.'
\v 17 Then singeth Israel this song, concerning the well — they have answered to it:
\v 18 A well — digged it have princes, Prepared it have nobles of the people, With the lawgiver, with their staves.' And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah,
\v 19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
\v 20 and from Bamoth in the valley which is in the field of Moab to the top of Pisgah, which had looked on the front of the wilderness.
\v 21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorite, saying,
\v 22 'Let me pass through your land, we do not turn aside into a field, or into a vineyard, we do not drink waters of a well; in the king's way we go, till that we pass over your border.'
\v 23 And Sihon had not suffered Israel to pass through his border, and Sihon gathereth all his people, and came out to meet Israel into the wilderness, and came in to Jahaz, and fighteth against Israel.
\v 24 And Israel smiteth him by the mouth of the sword, and possesseth his land from Arnon unto Jabbok — unto the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon is strong.
\v 25 And Israel taketh all these cities, and Israel dwelleth in all the cities of the Amorite, in Heshbon, and in all its villages;
\v 26 for Heshbon is a city of Sihon king of the Amorite, and he had fought against the former king of Moab, and taketh all his land out of his hand, unto Arnon;
\v 27 therefore those using similes say — 'Enter ye Heshbon, Let the city of Sihon be built and ready,
\v 28 For fire had gone out from Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon, It had consumed Ar of Moab, Owners of the high places of Arnon.
\v 29 Woe to thee, O Moab, Thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh, He had given his sons who escape — Also his daughters — Into captivity, to a king of the Amorite — Sihon!
\v 30 And we shoot them, Perished had Heshbon unto Dibon, And we make desolate unto Nophah, Which is unto Medeba.'
\v 31 And Israel dwelleth in the land of the Amorite,
\v 32 and Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they capture its villages, and dispossess the Amorite who is there,
\v 33 and turn and go up the way of Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out to meet them, he and all his people, to battle, at Edrei.
\v 34 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Fear him not, for into your hand I have given him, and all his people, and his land, and you hast done to him as you hast done to Sihon king of the Amorite, who is dwelling in Heshbon.'
\v 35 And they smite him, and his sons, and all his people, until he had not left to him a remnant, and they possess his land.
\c 22
\v 1 And the sons of Israel journey and encamp in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, by Jericho.
\v 2 And Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorite,
\v 3 and Moab is exceedingly afraid of the presence of the people, for it is numerous; and Moab is vexed by the presence of the sons of Israel,
\v 4 and Moab said unto the elders of Midian, 'Now did the assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the green thing of the field.' And Balak son of Zippor is king of Moab at that time,
\v 5 and he sent messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, 'Lo, a people had come out of Egypt; lo, it had covered the eye of the land, and it is abiding over-against me;
\v 6 and now, come, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for it is mightier than I; it may be I prevail — we smite it — and I cast it out from the land; for I have known — that which you blessest is blessed, and that which you cursest is cursed.'
\v 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go, and divinations in their hand, and they come in unto Balaam, and speak unto him the words of Balak,
\v 8 and he said unto them, 'Lodge here to-night, and I have brought you back word, as Yahweh spoke unto me;' and the princes of Moab abide with Balaam.
\v 9 And God came in unto Balaam, and said, 'Who are these men with thee?'
\v 10 And Balaam said unto God, 'Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, had sent unto me:
\v 11 Lo, the people that is coming out from Egypt and covereth the eye of the land, — now come, pierce it for me; it may be I am able to fight against it, and have cast it out;'
\v 12 and God said unto Balaam, 'Thou will not go with them; you will not curse the people; for it is blessed.'
\v 13 And Balaam riseth in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, 'Go unto your land, for Yahweh is refusing to suffer me to go with you;'
\v 14 and the princes of Moab rise, and come in unto Balak, and say, 'Balaam is refusing to come with us.'
\v 15 And Balak addeth yet to send princes, more numerous and honoured than these,
\v 16 and they come in unto Balaam, and say to him, 'Thus said Balak son of Zippor, Be not, I pray thee, withheld from coming unto me,
\v 17 for very greatly I honour thee, and all that you sayest unto me I do; and come, I pray thee, pierce for me this people.'
\v 18 And Balaam answereth and said unto the servants of Balak, 'If Balak did give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Yahweh my God, to do a little or a great thing;
\v 19 and, now, abide, I pray you, in this place, you also, to-night; and I know what Yahweh is adding to speak with me.'
\v 20 And God came in unto Balaam, by night, and said to him, 'If to call for thee the men have come, rise, go with them, and only the thing which I speak unto thee — it you will do.'
\v 21 And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and went with the princes of Moab,
\v 22 and the anger of God burneth because he is going, and a messenger of Yahweh stationeth himself in the way for an adversary to him, and he is riding on his ass, and two of his servants are with him,
\v 23 and the ass saw the messenger of Yahweh standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and the ass turneth aside out of the way, and went into a field, and Balaam smiteth the ass to turn it aside into the way.
\v 24 And the messenger of Yahweh standeth in a narrow path of the vineyards — a wall on this side and a wall on that — 
\v 25 and the ass saw the messenger of Yahweh, and is pressed unto the wall, and presseth Balaam's foot unto the wall, and he addeth to smite her;
\v 26 and the messenger of Yahweh addeth to pass over, and standeth in a strait place where there is no way to turn aside — right or left — 
\v 27 and the ass saw the messenger of Yahweh, and croucheth under Balaam, and the anger of Balaam burneth, and he smiteth the ass with a staff.
\v 28 And Yahweh opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, 'What have I done to thee that you hast smitten me these three times?'
\v 29 and Balaam said to the ass, 'Because you hast rolled yourself against me; oh that there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee;'
\v 30 and the ass said unto Balaam, 'Am not I yours ass, upon which you hast ridden since I was yours unto this day? have I at all been accustomed to do to thee thus?' and he said, 'No.'
\v 31 And Yahweh uncovereth the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the messenger of Yahweh standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and he boweth and did obeisance, to his face;
\v 32 and the messenger of Yahweh said unto him, 'Wherefore hast you smitten yours ass these three times? lo, I — I have come out for an adversary, for your way had been perverse before me,
\v 33 and the ass saw me, and turneth aside at my presence these three times; unless she had turned aside from my presence, surely now also, thee I had killed, and her kept alive.'
\v 34 And Balaam said unto the messenger of Yahweh, 'I have sinned, for I did not know that you art standing to meet me in the way; and now, if evil in yours eyes — I turn back by myself.'
\v 35 And the messenger of Yahweh said unto Balaam, 'Go with the men; and only the word which I speak unto thee — it you will speak;' and Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\v 36 And Balak heareth that Balaam had come, and went out to meet him, unto a city of Moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the extremity of the border;
\v 37 and Balak said unto Balaam, 'Did I not diligently sent unto thee to call for thee? why did you not come unto me? am I not truly able to honour thee?'
\v 38 And Balaam said unto Balak, 'Lo, I have come unto thee; now — am I at all able to speak anything? the word which God setteth in my mouth — it I do speak.'
\v 39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they come to Kirjath-Huzoth,
\v 40 and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who are with him;
\v 41 and it came to pass in the morning, that Balak taketh Balaam, and caused him to go up the high places of Baal, and he saw from there the extremity of the people.
\c 23
\v 1 And Balaam said unto Balak, 'Build for me in this place seven altars, and make ready for me in this place seven bullocks and seven rams.'
\v 2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak — Balaam also — offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar,
\v 3 and Balaam said to Balak, 'Station yourself by your burnt-offering and I go on, it may be Yahweh did come to meet me, and the thing which He sheweth me — I have declared to thee;' and he went to a high place.
\v 4 And God came unto Balaam, and he said unto Him, 'The seven altars I have arranged, and I offer a bullock and a ram on the altar;'
\v 5 and Yahweh putteth a word in the mouth of Balaam, and said, 'Turn back unto Balak, and thus you will speak.'
\v 6 And he turneth back unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, he and all the princes of Moab.
\v 7 And he taketh up his simile, and said: 'From Aram he did lead me — Balak king of Moab; From mountains of the east: Come — curse for me Jacob, And come — be indignant with Israel.
\v 8 What — do I pierce? — God had not pierced! And what — am I indignant? — Yahweh had not been indignant!
\v 9 For from the top of rocks I see it, And from heights I behold it; Lo a people! alone it did tabernacle, And among nations did not reckon itself.
\v 10 Who had counted the dust of Jacob, And the number of the fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of upright ones, And let my last end be like his!'
\v 11 And Balak said unto Balaam, 'What hast you done to me? to pierce mine enemies I have taken thee — and lo, you hast certainly blessed;'
\v 12 and he answereth and said, 'That which Yahweh did put in my mouth — it do I not take heed to speak?'
\v 13 And Balak said unto him, 'Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, whence you will see it, only its extremity you will see, and all of it you will not see, and pierce it for me there;'
\v 14 and he taketh him to the field of Zophim, unto the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offereth a bullock and a ram on the altar.
\v 15 And he said unto Balak, 'Station yourself here by your burnt-offering, and I — I meet Him there;'
\v 16 and Yahweh came unto Balaam, and setteth a word in his mouth, and said, 'Turn back unto Balak, and thus you will speak.'
\v 17 And he came unto him, and lo, he is standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him, and Balak said to him: 'What had Yahweh spoken?'
\v 18 And he taketh up his simile, and said: 'Rise, Balak, and hear; Give ear unto me, son of Zippor!
\v 19 God is not a man — and lieth, And a son of man — and repenteth! Hath He said — and did He not do it? And spoken — and did He not confirm it?
\v 20 Lo, to bless I have received: Yea, He blessed, and I can not reverse it.
\v 21 He had not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Nor had He seen perverseness in Israel; Yahweh his God is with him, And a shout of a king is in him.
\v 22 God is bringing them out from Egypt, As the swiftness of a Reem is to him;
\v 23 For no enchantment is against Jacob, Nor divination against Israel, At the time it is said of Jacob and Israel, What had God wrought!
\v 24 Lo, the people as a lioness riseth, And as a lion he lifteth himself up, He lieth not down till he eateth prey, And blood of pierced ones did drink.'
\v 25 And Balak said unto Balaam, 'Neither pierce it at all, nor bless it at all;'
\v 26 and Balaam answereth and said unto Balak, 'Have I not spoken unto thee, saying, All that Yahweh spoke — it I do?'
\v 27 And Balak said unto Balaam, 'Come, I pray thee, I take thee unto another place; it may be it is right in the eyes of God — to pierce it for me from there.'
\v 28 And Balak taketh Balaam to the top of Peor, which is looking on the front of the wilderness,
\v 29 and Balaam said unto Balak, 'Build for me in this place seven altars, and make ready for me in this place seven bullocks and seven rams;'
\v 30 and Balak did as Balaam said, and he offereth a bullock and a ram on an altar.
\c 24
\v 1 And Balaam saw that it is good in the eyes of Yahweh to bless Israel, and he had not gone as time by time to meet enchantments, and he setteth towards the wilderness his face;
\v 2 and Balaam lifteth up his eyes, and saw Israel tabernacling, by its tribes, and the Spirit of God is upon him,
\v 3 and he taketh up his simile, and said: 'An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor — And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut — 
\v 4 An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God — Who a vision of the Almighty saw, Falling — and eyes uncovered:
\v 5 How good have been your tents, O Jacob, Your tabernacles, O Israel;
\v 6 As valleys they have been stretched out, As gardens by a river; As aloes Yahweh had planted, As cedars by waters;
\v 7 He made water flow from his buckets, And his seed is in many waters; And higher than Agag is his king, And exalted is his kingdom.
\v 8 God is bringing him out of Egypt; As the swiftness of a Reem is to him, He eateth up nations his adversaries, And their bones he breaketh, And with his arrows he smiteth,
\v 9 He had bent, he had lain down as a lion, And as a lioness: who did raise him up? He who is blessing thee is blessed, And he who is cursing thee is cursed.'
\v 10 And the anger of Balak burneth against Balaam, and he striketh his hands; and Balak said unto Balaam, 'To pierce mine enemies I called thee, and lo, you hast certainly blessed — these three times;
\v 11 and now, flee for yourself unto your place; I have said, I do greatly honour thee, and lo, Yahweh had kept thee back from honour.'
\v 12 And Balaam said unto Balak, 'Did I not also unto your messengers whom you hast sent unto me, speak, saying,
\v 13 If Balak did give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Yahweh, to do good or evil of mine own heart — that which Yahweh spoke — it I speak?
\v 14 and, now, lo, I am going to my people; come, I counsel thee concerning that which this people did to your people, in the latter end of the days.'
\v 15 And he taketh up his simile, and said: 'An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor — And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut — 
\v 16 An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God — And knowing knowledge of the Most High; A vision of the Almighty he saw, Falling — and eyes uncovered:
\v 17 I see it, but not now; I behold it, but not near; A star had proceeded from Jacob, And a sceptre had risen from Israel, And had smitten corners of Moab, And had destroyed all sons of Sheth.
\v 18 And Edom had been a possession, And Seir had been a possession, for its enemies, And Israel is doing valiantly;
\v 19 And one did rule out of Jacob, And had destroyed a remnant from Ar.'
\v 20 And he saw Amalek, and taketh up his simile, and said: 'A beginning of the Goyim is Amalek; And his latter end — for ever he perisheth.'
\v 21 And he saw the Kenite, and taketh up his simile, and said: 'Enduring is your dwelling, And setting in a rock your nest,
\v 22 But the Kenite is for a burning; Till when did Asshur keep thee captive?'
\v 23 And he taketh up his simile, and said: 'Alas! who did live when God did this?
\v 24 And — ships are from the side of Chittim, And they have humbled Asshur, And they have humbled Eber, And it also for ever is perishing.'
\v 25 And Balaam riseth, and went, and turneth back to his place, and Balak also had gone on his way.
\c 25
\v 1 And Israel dwelleth in Shittim, and the people begin to go a-whoring unto daughters of Moab,
\v 2 and they call for the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people eat, and bow themselves to their gods,
\v 3 and Israel is joined to Baal-Peor, and the anger of Yahweh burneth against Israel.
\v 4 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them before Yahweh — over-against the sun; and the fierceness of the anger of Yahweh did turn back from Israel.'
\v 5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, 'Slay ye each his men who are joined to Baal-Peor.'
\v 6 And lo, a man of the sons of Israel had come, and brought in unto his brethren the Midianitess, before the eyes of Moses, and before the eyes of all the company of the sons of Israel, who are weeping at the opening of the tent of meeting;
\v 7 and Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, the priest, saw, and riseth from the middle of the company, and taketh a javelin in his hand,
\v 8 and went in after the man of Israel unto the hollow place, and pierceth them both, the man of Israel and the woman — unto her belly, and the plague is restrained from the sons of Israel;
\v 9 and the dead by the plague are four and twenty yousand.
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 11 'Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, had turned back My fury from the sons of Israel, by his being zealous with My zeal in their middle, and I have not consumed the sons of Israel in My zeal.
\v 12 'Therefore say, Lo, I am giving to him My covenant of peace,
\v 13 and it had been to him and to his seed after him a covenant of a priesthood age-during, because that he had been zealous for his God, and did make atonement for the sons of Israel.'
\v 14 And the name of the man of Israel who is smitten, who had been smitten with the Midianitess, is Zimri son of Salu, prince of the house of a father of the Simeonite;
\v 15 and the name of the woman who is smitten, the Midianitess, is Cozbi daughter of Zur, head of a people — of the house of a father in Midian is he.
\v 16 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 17 'Distress the Midianites, and ye have smitten them,
\v 18 for they are adversaries to you with their frauds, with which they have acted fraudulently to you, concerning the matter of Peor, and concerning the matter of Cozbi, daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who is smitten in the day of the plague for the matter of Peor.'
\c 26
\v 1 And it came to pass, after the plague, that Yahweh spoke unto Moses, and unto Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saying,
\v 2 'Take up the sum of all the company of the sons of Israel, from a son of twenty years and upward, by the house of their fathers, every one going out to the host in Israel.'
\v 3 And Moses spoke — Eleazar the priest also — with them, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho, saying,
\v 4 'From a son of twenty years and upward,' as Yahweh had commanded Moses and the sons of Israel who are coming out from the land of Egypt.

\v 54 to the many you will increase their inheritance, and to the few you will diminish their inheritance; to each according to his numbered ones is given his inheritance.

\v 63 These are those numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who have numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho;
\v 64 and among these there had not been a man of those numbered by Moses, and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai,
\v 65 for Yahweh said of them, 'They do certainly die in the wilderness;' and there had not been left of them a man save Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun.
\c 27
\v 1 And daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh son of Joseph, draw near — and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah — 
\v 2 and stand before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes, and all the company, at the opening of the tent of meeting, saying:
\v 3 Our father died in the wilderness, and he — he was not in the middle of the company who were met together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but for his own sin he died, and had no sons;
\v 4 why is the name of our father withdrawn from the middle of his family because he had no son? give to us a possession in the middle of the brethren of our father;'
\v 5 and Moses brought near their cause before Yahweh.
\v 6 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 7 'Rightly are the daughters of Zelophehad speaking; you will certainly give to them a possession of an inheritance in the middle of their father's brethren, and hast caused to pass over the inheritance of their father to them.
\v 8 'And unto the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, When a man dieth, and had no son, then ye have caused his inheritance to pass over to his daughter;
\v 9 and if he have no daughter, then ye have given his inheritance to his brethren;
\v 10 and if he have no brethren, then ye have given his inheritance to his father's brethren;
\v 11 and if his father have no brethren, then ye have given his inheritance to his relation who is near unto him of his family, and he had possessed it;' and it had been to the sons of Israel for a statute of judgment, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 12 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Go up unto this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel;
\v 13 and you hast seen it, and you hast been gathered unto your people, also you, as Aaron your brother had been gathered,
\v 14 because ye provoked My mouth in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the company — to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes;' they are waters of Meribah, in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin.
\v 15 And Moses spoke unto Yahweh, saying,
\v 16 Yahweh — God of the spirits of all flesh — appoint a man over the company,
\v 17 who went out before them, and who came in before them, and who taketh them out, and who brought them in, and the company of Yahweh is not as sheep which have no shepherd.'
\v 18 And Yahweh said unto Moses, 'Take to thee Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and you hast laid yours hand upon him,
\v 19 and hast caused him to stand before Eleazar the priest, and before all the company, and hast charged him before their eyes,
\v 20 and hast put of yours honour upon him, so that all the company of the sons of Israel do hearken.
\v 21 'And before Eleazar the priest he standeth, and he had asked for him by the judgment of the Lights before Yahweh; at His word they go out, and at His word they come in; he, and all the sons of Israel with him, even all the company.'
\v 22 And Moses did as Yahweh had commanded him, and taketh Joshua, and caused him to stand before Eleazar the priest, and before all the company,
\v 23 and laid his hands upon him, and chargeth him, as Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Moses.
\c 28
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 'Command the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, My offering, My bread for My fire-offerings, My sweet fragrance, ye take heed to bring near to Me in its appointed season.
\v 3 And you hast said to them, This is the fire-offering which ye bring near to Yahweh: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering;
\v 4 the one lamb you preparest in the morning, and the second lamb you preparest between the evenings;
\v 5 and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;
\v 6 a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Yahweh;
\v 7 and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause you a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Yahweh.
\v 8 And the second lamb you will prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation you preparest — a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Yahweh.
\v 9 'And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;
\v 10 the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its libation.
\v 11 'And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Yahweh: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;
\v 12 and three-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one bullock, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
\v 13 and a several tenth deal of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one lamb; a burnt-offering, a sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Yahweh;
\v 14 and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock, and a third of the hin to a ram, and a fourth of the hin to a lamb, of wine; this is the burnt-offering of every month for the months of the year;
\v 15 and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Yahweh; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation.
\v 16 And in the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, is the passover to Yahweh;
\v 17 and in the fifteenth day of this month is a festival, seven days unleavened food is eaten;
\v 18 in the first day is an holy convocation, ye do no servile work,
\v 19 and ye have brought near a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to Yahweh: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, and seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones they are for you;
\v 20 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for a bullock, and two-tenth deals for a ram ye do prepare;
\v 21 a several tenth deal you preparest for the one lamb, for the seven lambs,
\v 22 and one goat, a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
\v 23 Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for the continual burnt-offering, ye prepare these;
\v 24 according to these ye prepare daily, seven days, bread of a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Yahweh; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation;
\v 25 and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work.
\v 26 'And in the day of the first-fruits, in your bringing near a new present to Yahweh, in your weeks, a holy convocation ye have; ye do no servile work;
\v 27 and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Yahweh: two bullocks, sons of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year,
\v 28 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals to the one bullock, two-tenth deals to the one ram,
\v 29 a several tenth deal to the one lamb, for the seven lambs;
\v 30 one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;
\v 31 apart from the continual burnt-offering and its present ye prepare them (perfect ones they are for you) and their libations.
\c 29
\v 1 'And in the seventh month, in the first of the month, a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work; a day of shouting it is to you;
\v 2 and ye have prepared a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance to Yahweh: one bullock, a son of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;
\v 3 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for the bullock, two-tenth deals for the ram,

\v 40 And Moses said unto the sons of Israel according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\v 1 And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, 'This is the thing which Yahweh had commanded:
\v 2 'When a man voweth a vow to Yahweh, or had sworn an oath to bind a bond on his soul, he did not pollute his word; according to all that is going out from his mouth he did.
\v 3 'And when a woman voweth a vow to Yahweh, and had bound a bond in the house of her father in her youth,
\v 4 and her father had heard her vow, and her bond which she had bound on her soul, and her father had kept silent at her, then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she had bound on her soul is established.
\v 5 'And if her father had disallowed her in the day of his hearing, none of her vows and her bonds which she had bound on her soul is established, and Yahweh is propitious to her, for her father had disallowed her.
\v 6 And if she be at all to a husband, and her vows are on her, or a wrongful utterance on her lips, which she had bound on her soul,
\v 7 and her husband had heard, and in the day of his hearing, he had kept silent at her, then have her vows been established, and her bonds which she had bound on her soul are established.
\v 8 And if in the day of her husband's hearing he disalloweth her, then he had broken her vow which is on her, and the wrongful utterance of her lips which she had bound on her soul, and Yahweh is propitious to her.
\v 9 'As to the vow of a widow or cast-out woman, all that she had bound on her soul is established on her.
\v 10 And if in the house of her husband she had vowed, or had bound a bond on her soul with an oath,
\v 11 and her husband had heard, and had kept silent at her — he had not disallowed her — then have all her vows been established, and every bond which she had bound on her soul is established.
\v 12 And if her husband did certainly break them in the day of his hearing, none of the outgoing of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, is established — her husband had broken them — and Yahweh is propitious to her.
\v 13 Every vow and every oath — a bond to humble a soul — her husband did establish it, or her husband did break it;
\v 14 and if her husband certainly keep silent at her, from day unto day, then he had established all her vows, or all her bonds which are upon her; he had established them, for he had kept silent at her in the day of his hearing;
\v 15 and if he did at all break them after his hearing, then he had borne her iniquity.'
\v 16 These are the statutes which Yahweh had commanded Moses between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her youth, in the house of her father.
\c 31
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Execute the vengeance of the sons of Israel against the Midianites — afterwards you art gathered unto your people.'
\v 3 And Moses spoke unto the people, saying, 'Be ye armed some of you for the host, and they are against Midian, to put the vengeance of Yahweh on Midian;
\v 4 a yousand for a tribe — a yousand for a tribe, to all the tribes of Israel — ye do send to the host.'
\v 5 And there are given out of the yousands of Israel a yousand for a tribe, twelve yousand armed ones of the host;
\v 6 and Moses sent them, a yousand for a tribe, to the host, them and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, to the host; and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the shouting, in his hand.
\v 7 And they war against Midian, as Yahweh had commanded Moses, and slay every male;
\v 8 and the kings of Midian they have killed, besides their pierced ones, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam son of Beor, they have killed with the sword.
\v 9 And the sons of Israel take captive the women of Midian, and their infants; and all their cattle, and all their substance, and all their wealth they have plundered;
\v 10 and all their cities, with their habitations, and all their towers, they have burnt with fire.
\v 11 And they take all the spoil, and all the prey, among man and among beast;
\v 12 and they bring in, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the company of the sons of Israel, the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto the camp, unto the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan, near Jericho.
\v 13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the company, go out to meet them, unto the outside of the camp,
\v 14 and Moses is wroth against the inspectors of the force, chiefs of the yousands, and chiefs of the hundreds, who are coming in from the host of the battle.
\v 15 And Moses said unto them, 'Have ye kept alive every female?
\v 16 lo, they — they have been to the sons of Israel, through the word of Balaam, to cause a trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and the plague is in the company of Yahweh.
\v 17 'And now, slay ye every male among the infants, yea, every woman known of man by the lying of a male ye have killed;
\v 18 and all the infants among the women, who have not known the lying of a male, ye have kept alive for yourselves.
\v 19 And ye, encamp ye at the outside of the camp seven days — any who had killed a person, and any who had come against a pierced one, ye cleanse yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day — ye and your captives;
\v 20 and every garment, and every skin vessel, and every work of goats' hair, and every wooden vessel, ye yourselves cleanse.'
\v 21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of the host who go in to battle, 'This is the statute of the law which Yahweh had commanded Moses:
\v 22 only, the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\v 23 every thing which may go into fire, ye cause to pass over through fire, and it had been clean; only, with the water of separation it is cleansed, and all that may not go into fire, ye cause to pass over through water;
\v 24 and ye have washed your garments on the seventh day, and have been clean, and afterwards ye come in unto the camp.'
\v 25 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 26 'Take up the sum of the prey of the captives, among man and among beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the company;
\v 27 and you hast halved the prey between those handling the battle who go out to the host and all the company;
\v 28 and you hast raised a tribute to Yahweh from the men of war, who go out to the host, one body out of five hundred, of man, and of the herd, and of the asses, and of the flock;
\v 29 from their half ye do take, and you hast given to Eleazar the priest — the heave-offering of Yahweh.
\v 30 'And from the sons of Israel's half you will take one possession out of fifty, of man, of the herd, of the asses, and of the flock, of all the cattle, and you hast given them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Yahweh.'
\v 31 And Moses did — Eleazar the priest also — as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 32 And the prey, the residue of the spoil which the people of the host have spoiled, is of the flock six hundred yousand, and seventy yousand, and five yousand;
\v 33 and of the herd two and seventy yousand;
\v 34 and of asses one and sixty yousand;
\v 35 and of human beings — of the women who have not known the lying of a male — all the persons are two and thirty yousand.
\v 36 And the half — the portion of those who go out into the host — the number of the flock is three hundred yousand, and thirty yousand, and seven yousand and five hundred.
\v 37 And the tribute to Yahweh of the sheep is six hundred five and seventy;
\v 38 and the herd is six and thirty yousand, and their tribute to Yahweh is two and seventy;
\v 39 and the asses are thirty yousand and five hundred, and their tribute to Yahweh is one and sixty;
\v 40 and the human beings are sixteen yousand, and their tribute to Yahweh is two and thirty persons.
\v 41 And Moses gave the tribute — Yahweh's heave-offering — to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 42 And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses halved from the men who war — 
\v 43 and the company's half is, of the flock three hundred yousand, and thirty yousand, seven yousand and five hundred;
\v 44 and of the herd six and thirty yousand;
\v 45 and of asses thirty yousand and five hundred;
\v 46 and of human beings sixteen yousand — 
\v 47 Moses taketh from the sons of Israel's half the one possession from the fifty, of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 48 And the inspectors whom the yousands of the host had, (heads of the yousands and heads of the hundreds), draw near unto Moses,
\v 49 and they say unto Moses, 'Your servants have taken up the sum of the men of war who are with us, and not a man of us had been missed;
\v 50 and we bring near Yahweh's offering, each that which he had found, vessels of gold — chain, and bracelet, seal-ring, ear -ring, and bead — to make atonement for ourselves before Yahweh.'
\v 51 And Moses receiveth — Eleazar the priest also — the gold from them, every made vessel,
\v 52 and all the gold of the heave-offering which they have lifted up to Yahweh is sixteen yousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from heads of the yousands, and from heads of the hundreds;
\v 53 (the men of the host have spoiled each for himself);
\v 54 and Moses taketh — Eleazar the priest also — the gold from the heads of the yousands and of the hundreds, and they bring it in unto the tent of meeting — a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh.
\c 32
\v 1 And much cattle had been to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad, very many; and they see the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, and lo, the place is a place for cattle;
\v 2 and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Reuben, come in and speak unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the company, saying:
\v 3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon — 
\v 4 the land which Yahweh had smitten before the company of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle.'
\v 5 And they say, 'If we have found grace in yours eyes, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; cause us not to pass over the Jordan.'
\v 6 And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, 'Do your brethren go in to the battle, and ye — do ye sit here?
\v 7 and why discourage ye the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over unto the land which Yahweh had given to them?
\v 8 'Thus did your fathers in my sending them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land;
\v 9 and they go up unto the valley of Eshcol, and see the land, and discourage the heart of the sons of Israel so as not to go in unto the land which Yahweh had given to them;
\v 10 and the anger of Yahweh burneth in that day, and He sweareth, saying,
\v 11 They do not see — the men who are coming up out of Egypt from a son of twenty years and upward — the ground which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, for they have not been fully after Me;
\v 12 save Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua son of Nun, for they have been fully after Yahweh;
\v 13 and the anger of Yahweh burneth against Israel, and He caused them to wander in the wilderness forty years, until the consumption of all the generation which is doing the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 14 And lo, ye have risen in the stead of your fathers, an increase of men — sinners, to add yet to the fury of the anger of Yahweh toward Israel;
\v 15 when ye turn back from after Him, then He had added yet to leave him in the wilderness, and ye have done corruptly to all this people.'
\v 16 And they come nigh unto him, and say, 'Folds for the flock we build for our cattle here, and cities for our infants;
\v 17 and we — we are armed hasting before the sons of Israel till that we have brought them in unto their place; and our infants have dwelt in the cities of defence because of the inhabitants of the land;
\v 18 we do not turn back unto our houses till the sons of Israel have inherited each his inheritance,
\v 19 for we do not inherit with them beyond the Jordan and yonder, for our inheritance had come unto us beyond the Jordan at the sun -rising.'
\v 20 And Moses said unto them, 'If ye do this thing: if ye are armed before Yahweh for battle,
\v 21 and every armed one of you had passed over the Jordan before Yahweh, till his dispossessing His enemies from before Him,
\v 22 and the land had been subdued before Yahweh — then afterwards ye do turn back, and have been acquitted by Yahweh, and by Israel; and this land had been to you for a possession before Yahweh.
\v 23 'And if ye do not so, lo, ye have sinned against Yahweh, and know ye your sin, that it did find you;
\v 24 build for yourselves cities for your infants, and folds for your flock, and that which is going out from your mouth do ye.'
\v 25 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben speak unto Moses, saying, 'Your servants do as my lord is commanding;
\v 26 our infants, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts, are there in cities of Gilead,
\v 27 and your servants pass over, every armed one of the host, before Yahweh, to battle, as my lord is saying.'
\v 28 And Moses commandeth concerning them Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel;
\v 29 and Moses said unto them, 'If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben pass over with you the Jordan, every one armed for battle, before Yahweh, and the land had been subdued before you, then ye have given to them the land of Gilead for a possession;
\v 30 and if they do not pass over armed with you, then they have possessions in your middle in the land of Canaan.'
\v 31 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answer, saying, 'That which Yahweh had spoken unto your servants — so we do;
\v 32 we — we pass over armed before Yahweh to the land of Canaan, and with us is the possession of our inheritance beyond the Jordan.'
\v 33 And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorite, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land by its cities, in the borders, the cities of the land round about.
\v 34 And the sons of Gad build Dihon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\v 35 and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
\v 36 and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran, cities of defence, and sheepfolds.
\v 37 And the sons of Reuben have build Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
\v 38 and Nebo, and Baal-Meon (changed in name), and Shibmah, and they call by these names the names of the cities which they have built.
\v 39 And sons of Machir son of Manasseh go to Gilead, and capture it, and dispossess the Amorite, who is in it;
\v 40 and Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he dwelleth in it.
\v 41 And Jair son of Manasseh had gone and captureth their towns, and called them 'Towns of Jair;'
\v 42 and Nobah had gone and captureth Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, by his own name.

\v 1 These are journeys of the sons of Israel who have come out of the land of Egypt, by their hosts, by the hand of Moses and Aaron;
\v 2 and Moses writeth their outgoings, by their journeys, by the command of Yahweh; and these are their journeys, by their outgoings:
\v 3 And they journey from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, on the morrow of the passover have the sons of Israel gone out with a high hand, before the eyes of all the Egyptians — 
\v 4 and the Egyptians are burying those whom Yahweh had smitten among them, every first-born, and on their gods had Yahweh done judgments — 
\v 5 and the sons of Israel journey from Rameses, and encamp in Succoth.
\v 6 And they journey from Succoth, and encamp in Etham, which is in the extremity of the wilderness;
\v 7 and they journey from Etham, and turn back on Pi-Hahiroth, which is on the front of Baal-Zephon, and they encamp before Migdol.
\v 8 And they journey from Pi-Hahiroth, and pass over through the middle of the sea, into the wilderness, and go a journey of three days in the wilderness of Etham, and encamp in Marah.
\v 9 And they journey from Marah, and come in to Elim, and in Elim are twelve fountains of waters, and seventy palm trees, and they encamp there;
\v 10 and they journey from Elim, and encamp by the Red Sea.
\v 11 And they journey from the Red Sea, and encamp in the wilderness of Sin;
\v 12 and they journey from the wilderness of Sin, and encamp in Dophkah.
\v 13 And they journey from Dophkah, and encamp in Alush;
\v 14 and they journey from Alush, and encamp in Rephidim; and there was there no water for the people to drink.
\v 15 And they journey from Rephidim, and encamp in the wilderness of Sinai;
\v 16 and they journey from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamp in Kibroth-Hattaavah.
\v 17 And they journey from Kibroth-Hattaavah, and encamp in Hazeroth;
\v 18 and they journey from Hazeroth, and encamp in Rithmah.
\v 19 And they journey from Rithmah, and encamp in Rimmon-Parez;
\v 20 and they journey from Rimmon-Parez, and encamp in Libnah.
\v 21 And they journey from Libnah, and encamp in Rissah;
\v 22 and they journey from Rissah, and encamp in Kehelathah.
\v 23 And they journey from Kehelathah, and encamp in mount Shapher;
\v 24 and they journey from mount Shapher, and encamp in Haradah.
\v 25 And they journey from Haradah, and encamp in Makheloth;
\v 26 and they journey from Makheloth, and encamp in Tahad.
\v 27 And they journey from Tahad, and encamp in Tarah;
\v 28 and they journey from Tarah, and encamp in Mithcah.
\v 29 And they journey from Mithcah, and encamp in Hashmonah;
\v 30 and they journey from Hashmonah, and encamp in Moseroth.
\v 31 And they journey from Moseroth, and encamp in Bene-Jaakan;
\v 32 and they journey from Bene-Jaakan, and encamp at Hor-Hagidgad.
\v 33 And they journey from Hor-Hagidgad, and encamp in Jotbathah;
\v 34 and they journey from Jotbathah, and encamp in Ebronah.
\v 35 And they journey from Ebronah, and encamp in Ezion-Gaber;
\v 36 and they journey from Ezion-Gaber, and encamp in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
\v 37 And they journey from Kadesh, and encamp in mount Hor, in the extremity of the land of Edom.
\v 38 And Aaron the priest went up unto mount Hor, by the command of Yahweh, and dieth there, in the fortieth year of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first of the month;
\v 39 and Aaron is a son of a hundred and twenty and three years in his dying in mount Hor.
\v 40 And the Canaanite — king Arad — who is dwelling in the south, in the land of Canaan, heareth of the coming of the sons of Israel.
\v 41 And they journey from mount Hor, and encamp in Zalmonah;
\v 42 and they journey from Zalmonah, and encamp in Punon.
\v 43 And they journey from Punon, and encamp in Oboth;
\v 44 and they journey from Oboth, and encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the border of Moab.
\v 45 And they journey from Iim, and encamp in Dibon-Gad;
\v 46 and they journey from Dibon-Gad, and encamp in Almon-Diblathaim.
\v 47 And they journey from Almon-Diblathaim, and encamp in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo;
\v 48 and they journey from the mountains of Abarim, and encamp in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho.
\v 49 And they encamp by the Jordan from Beth-Jeshimoth, unto Abel-Shittim, in the plains of Moab.
\v 50 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho, saying,
\v 51 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When ye are passing over the Jordan unto the land of Canaan,
\v 52 then ye have dispossessed all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and have destroyed all their imagery, yea, all their molten images ye destroy, and all their high places ye lay waste,
\v 53 and ye have possessed the land, and dwelt in it, for to you I have given the land — to possess it.
\v 54 'And ye have inherited the land by lot, by your families; to the many ye increase their inheritance, and to the few ye diminish their inheritance; whither the lot went out to him, it is his; by the tribes of your fathers ye inherit.
\v 55 And if ye do not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it had been, those whom ye let remain of them, are for pricks in your eyes, and for thorns in your sides, and they have distressed you on the land in which ye are dwelling,
\v 56 and it had come to pass, as I yought to do to them — I do to you.'
\c 34
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Command the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When ye are coming in unto the land of Canaan — this is the land which falleth to you by inheritance, the land of Canaan, by its borders — 
\v 3 then had the south quarter been to you from the wilderness of Zin, by the sides of Edom, yea, the south border had been to you from the extremity of the Salt Sea, eastward;
\v 4 and the border had turned round to you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and had passed on to Zin, and its outgoings have been from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and it had gone out at Hazar-Addar, and had passed on to Azmon;
\v 5 and the border had turned round from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its outgoings have been at the sea.
\v 6 'As to the west border, even the great sea had been to you a border; this is to you the west border.
\v 7 'And this is to you the north border: from the great sea ye mark out for yourselves mount Hor;
\v 8 from mount Hor ye mark out to go in to Hamath, and the outgoings of the border have been to Zedad;
\v 9 and the border had gone out to Ziphron, and its outgoings have been at Hazar-Enan; this is to you the north border.
\v 10 'And ye have marked out for yourselves for the border eastward, from Hazar-Enan to Shepham;
\v 11 and the border had gone down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east of Ain, and the border had gone down, and had smitten against the shoulder of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
\v 12 and the border had gone down to the Jordan, and its outgoings have been at the Salt Sea; this is for you the land by its borders round about.'
\v 13 And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, saying, 'This is the land which ye inherit by lot, which Yahweh had commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half of the tribe;
\v 14 for the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received, by the house of their fathers; and the tribe of the children of Gad, by the house of their fathers; and the half of the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance;
\v 15 the two tribes and the half of the tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan, near Jericho, eastward, at the sun -rising.'
\v 16 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 17 These are the names of the men who give to you the inheritance of the land: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun,
\v 18 and one prince — one prince — for a tribe ye do take to give the land by inheritance.
\v 19 And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
\v 20 and of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel son of Aminihud;
\v 21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon;
\v 22 and of the tribe of the sons of Dan, the prince Bukki son of Jogli;
\v 23 of the sons of Joseph, of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, the prince Hanniel son of Ephod;
\v 24 and of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, the prince Kemuel son of Shiphtan;
\v 25 and of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, the prince Elizaphan son of Parnach;
\v 26 and of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince Paltiel son of Azzan;
\v 27 and of the tribe of the sons of Asher, the prince Ahihud son of Shelomi;
\v 28 and of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, the prince Pedahel son of Ammihud.'
\v 29 These are those whom Yahweh had commanded to give the sons of Israel inheritance in the land of Canaan.
\c 35
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho, saying,
\v 2 'Command the sons of Israel, and they have given to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to inhabit; also a suburb for the cities round about them ye do give to the Levites.
\v 3 And the cities have been to them to inhabit, and their suburbs are for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
\v 4 And the suburbs of the cities which ye give to the Levites are, from the wall of the city and wiyout, a yousand cubits round about.
\v 5 And ye have measured from the outside of the city, the east quarter, two yousand by the cubit, and the south quarter, two yousand by the cubit, and the west quarter, two yousand by the cubit, and the north quarter, two yousand by the cubit; and the city is in the middle; this is to them the suburbs of the cities.
\v 6 And the cities which ye give to the Levites are the six cities of refuge, which ye give for the fleeing thither of the man-slayer, and besides them ye give forty and two cities;
\v 7 all the cities which ye give to the Levites are forty and eight cities, them and their suburbs.
\v 8 And the cities which ye give are of the possession of the sons of Israel, from the many ye multiply, and from the few ye diminish; each, according to his inheritance which they inherit, did give of his cities to the Levites.'
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying,
\v 10 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and you hast said unto them, When ye are passing over the Jordan to the land of Canaan,
\v 11 and have prepared to yourselves cities — cities of refuge they are to you — then fled thither had a man-slayer, smiting a person unawares,
\v 12 and the cities have been to you for a refuge from the redeemer, and the man-slayer did not die till his standing before the company for judgment.
\v 13 As to the cities which ye give — six are cities of refuge to you;
\v 14 the three of the cities ye give beyond the Jordan, and the three of the cities ye give in the land of Canaan; cities of refuge they are.
\v 15 To sons of Israel, and to a sojourner, and to a settler in their middle, are these six cities for a refuge, for the fleeing thither of any one smiting a person unawares.
\v 16 And if with an instrument of iron he had smitten him, and he dieth, he is a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death.
\v 17 And if with a stone in the hand, wherewith he dieth, he had smitten him, and he dieth, he is a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death.
\v 18 Or with a wooden instrument in the hand, wherewith he dieth, he had smitten him, and he dieth, he is a murderer: the murderer is certainly put to death.
\v 19 'The redeemer of blood himself did put the murderer to death; in his coming against him he did put him to death.
\v 20 And if in hatred he thrust him through, or had cast anything at him by lying in wait, and he dieth;
\v 21 or in enmity he had smitten him with his hand, and he dieth; the smiter is certainly put to death; he is a murderer; the redeemer of blood did put the murderer to death in his coming against him.
\v 22 'And if, in an instant, wiyout enmity, he had thrust him through, or had cast at him any instrument, wiyout lying in wait;
\v 23 or with any stone wherewith he dieth, wiyout seeing, and caused it to fall upon him, and he dieth, and he is not his enemy, nor seeking his evil;
\v 24 then have the company judged between the smiter and the redeemer of blood, by these judgments.
\v 25 'And the company have delivered the man-slayer out of the hand of the redeemer of blood, and the company have caused him to turn back unto the city of his refuge, whither he had fled, and he had dwelt in it till the death of the chief priest, who had been anointed with the holy oil.
\v 26 And if the man-slayer at all go out from the border of the city of his refuge whither he fleeth,
\v 27 and the redeemer of blood had found him at the outside of the border of the city of his refuge, and the redeemer of blood had killed the man-slayer, blood is not for him;
\v 28 for in the city of his refuge he did dwell till the death of the chief priest; and after the death of the chief priest did the man-slayer turn back unto the city of his possession.
\v 29 'And these things have been to you for a statute of judgment to your generations, in all your dwellings:
\v 30 whoso smiteth a person, by the mouth of witnesses did one slay the murderer; and one witness did not testify against a person — to die.
\v 31 And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who is condemned — to die, for he is certainly put to death;
\v 32 and ye take no atonement for him to flee unto the city of his refuge, to turn back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\v 33 And ye profane not the land which ye are in, for blood profaneth the land; as to the land, it is not pardoned for blood which is shed in it except by the blood of him who sheddeth it;
\v 34 and ye defile not the land in which ye are dwelling, in the middle of which I do tabernacle, for I Yahweh do tabernacle in the middle of the sons of Israel.'
\c 36
\v 1 And the heads of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, come near, and speak before Moses, and before the princes, heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel,
\v 2 and say, Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel, and my lord had been commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
\v 3 And — they have been to one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel for wives, and their inheritance had been withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers, and had been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the lot of our inheritance it is withdrawn,
\v 4 and if it is the jubilee of the sons of Israel, then had their inheritance been added to the inheritance of the tribe which is theirs, and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers is their inheritance withdrawn.'
\v 5 And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, by the command of Yahweh, saying, 'Rightly are the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaking;
\v 6 this is the thing which Yahweh had commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To those good in their eyes let them be for wives; only, to a family of the tribe of their fathers let them be for wives;
\v 7 and the inheritance of the sons of Israel did not turn round from tribe unto tribe; for each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers, do the sons of Israel cleave.
\v 8 'And every daughter possessing an inheritance, of the tribes of the sons of Israel, is to one of the family of the tribe of her father for a wife, so that the sons of Israel possess each the inheritance of his fathers,
\v 9 and the inheritance did not turn round from one tribe to another tribe; for each to his inheritance do they cleave, the tribes of the sons of Israel.'
\v 10 As Yahweh had commanded Moses, so have the daughters of Zelophehad done,
\v 11 and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, daughters of Zelophehad, are to the sons of their fathers' brethren for wives;
\v 12 to men of the families of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, they have been for wives, and their inheritance is with the tribe of the family of their father.
\v 13 These are the commands and the judgments which Yahweh had commanded, by the hand of Moses, concerning the sons of Israel, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho.
